Make sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 36 OPVs based on blends of benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene copolymers and PC61BM exhibited PCEs as high as 2.17% . 37-40 In this paper , we report creation of a new fused - ring building block dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 8 , Figure 2 ) and its application in design and synthesis of conjugated polymers. The combination of benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene planarity and efficient π-π stacking with the electron - withdrawing capacity of the imide functionality serves as the foundation for this new class of materials. Introduction of the π-electron - deficient imide moiety can decrease the HOMO and LUMO energies of the polymers , which is necessary for air - stable polymers. Furthermore , substitution at the imide nitrogen allows introduction of functionalities and solubility improvement with varying degrees of steric bulk while not impinging on critical intermolecular π-π stacking characteristics. This motif also leaves the benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene 2-and 7-positions available for polymerization. Finally , the dipole moment caused by the imide could stabilize cofacial antiparallel intra-and interchain repeat unit orientations , planarize the backbone , and promote π-π stacking. 27 On the basis of this new building block , we designed and synthesized a series of conjugated copolymers : unit 8 coupled with electron - rich unit benzo[1,2b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene ( P1 and P2 ) or with electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole ( P3 and P4 ) or benzo [c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( P5 ) and homopolymer ( P6 ) ( Figure 2 ). The optical properties and electronic structure ( HOMO / LUMO levels and bandgap ) can be manipulated through adjusting copolymerized building blocks. ' RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization. The synthetic routes to the monomers and polymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. We chose very cheap , industrial product maleic anhydride as a starting material. Bromination of maleic anhydride with Br 2 gave its dibromide ( 1 ). 41 Then , amination with alkylamine afforded the alkyl-substituted 3,4dibromopyrrole-2,5-dione ( 2a,b ). Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide 2a,b with 3-thienylboronic acid gave 3,4-bis(3-thienyl)pyrrole-2,5-dione ( 3a,b ). The large sulfur - containing polycyclic aromatic imides , dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 4a,b ) , were synthesized through iron(III) chloride - mediated oxidative cyclization , which is a general strategy for ring closure. 42 Bromination of 4a , b with Br 2 gave rise to the monomers 5a,b. Stille coupling reaction of 5a with tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane afforded 2,7-bis(2-thienyl)-dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 6a ) , which was brominated with NBS to afford monomer 7a. Copolymers P1-P4 were synthesized through Stille coupling reaction of the dibromide monomers 5a,b or 7a with benzodithiophene-2,6-ditin or 2,2 0 -bithiazole-5,5 0 -ditin , while P5 was synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide monomer 5b with benzothiadiazole-4,7-diboronic ester. Homopolymer P6 was synthesized by palladium - catalyzed homocoupling of the dibromide 5b in the presence of hexabutylditin. P1 with three solubilizing n-dodecyl groups has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , THF , and toluene.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
