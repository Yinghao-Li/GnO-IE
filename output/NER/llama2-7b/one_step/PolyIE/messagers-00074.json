Make sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: In most reported cases , the band gaps of conjugated polymers are reduced by incorporating more thiophene units between the donor and the acceptor segments owing to the more extended and delocalized π-electron system. 49-51 However , it was interesting to notice that PIDT-C12NT , which has four thiophenes in each repeat unit , presented a simultaneous bathochromic shift of short wavelength absorption peak to 465 nm and hypsochromic shift of the long wavelength absorption peak to 593 nm along with increased relative intensity of the high and low - energy peaks. Analogous event has also been realized in D-A type of oligomers and polymers based on 3,4bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene or 2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene as donor and BT as acceptor , which demonstrated that with the depleting composition of BT unit along the conjugated backbone , the dual absorbing bands were induced to move toward the maximum absorption ( λ max ) of the all - donor homopolymer that located in between of the dual absorbance. 52 In solid state , all polymers showed red - shifted absorption spectra compare to their solution absorption ( Figure 2b ) , which could be ascribed to the aggregation of polymer main chain. We realized a slightly bathochromic shift of the PIDT - DTNT absorbance relative to that of the PIDT - EHNT , which was in consistent with the trend realized in solution , while PIDT-C12NT showed a pronounced bathochromic shift of the low energy band absorption with λ max moved from 593 nm in solution to 619 nm as thin film. It was also worth noting that PIDT-C12NT showed much higher absorption coefficient than other two polymers in the whole visible area. Considering that high photo flux of solar spectrum within the region of about 550-700 nm , more intensified absorption of PIDT-C12NT indicated that more sunlight can be harvested that would potentially lead to higher J sc than the other two polymers. The optical band gaps of the polymers are in the range of 1.64 - 1.69 eV as estimated from the absorption onset and the detailed results are summarized in Table 1. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements were carried out to evaluate the molecular frontier orbitals of the resulted polymers. The graphite , platinum wire , and Ag / AgCl were used as the working electrode , counter electrode , and reference electrode , respectively. Polymer films were casted from chlorobenzene solution with concentration of 8 mg mL -1 and all measurements were carried out under inert atmosphere. Figure 3 showed the oxidation of cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films on graphite disk electrode in tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate ( Bu 4 NPF 6 ) solution ( 0.1 M in acetonitrile ) at a scan rate of 50 mV s^-1 .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
