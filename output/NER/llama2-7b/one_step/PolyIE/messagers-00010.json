The optical band gaps of the polymers could be tuned from 1.41 eV to 1.61 eV by changing the number of thiophene spacers. Electrochemical measurements showed that the increase of band gap is mainly due to the change of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level. The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymer solar cells based on the three polymers and PC 70 BM reached 3.12% with x = 2 under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . This approach could provide a simple strategy for designing high - performance D-A type photovoltaic polymers based on the existing polymers and a large potential to improve their performance further. † Electronic supplementary information ( ESI ) available : XRD patterns , DFT and TD - DFT calculations.

[5][6][7] While the advantage of P3HT is its simple structure with a relatively high hole mobility , the weak point of P3HT as the photovoltaic donor material towards efficient PSCs is the mismatch of its absorption spectrum ( absorption edge is about 650 nm ) with the terrestrial solar spectrum. The band gap of P3HT ( 1.9 eV ) is larger than the optimum band gap range ( 1.3 - 1.5 eV ) for polymer - fullerene BHJ solar cells. 8 Hence , design of photovoltaic polymers with broader absorption toward longer wavelengths , especially in the near - infrared ( NIR ) range , is necessary for high efficiency conjugated polymer donor materials.
