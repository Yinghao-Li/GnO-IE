Make sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Significant progress has been made in synthesis of conjugated polymers and their applications for optoelectronic device such as organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , organic photovoltaic cells ( OPVs ) , and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) since Heeger , MacDiarmid , and Shirakawa discovered conducting polymers in 1976.^1 As a result of the low - cost , light - weight , and flexibility advantages , optoelectronic devices based on conjugated polymers are a promising cost - effective alternative to inorganic materials - based microelectronics. Conjugated polymers can be classified as hole ( p - type ) or electron ( n - type ) transporting materials according to the type of orderly transferring charge carriers. Most of conjugated polymers are p - type semiconductors that have seen a dramatic rise in performance over the past decade while much less attention has been devoted to n - type semiconducting polymers that have lagged behind their p - type counterparts. 2 Organic n - type materials are essential for the fabrication of organic p-n junctions , OPVs , n-channel OFETs , OLEDs , and complementary logic circuits. 3 The n - type building blocks are the core components in n - type semiconducting polymers. Aromatic imides such as rylene diimides are one of the classical n - type building blocks and can exhibit relatively high electron affinities , high electron mobilities , and excellent chemical , thermal , and photochemical stabilities. 4 These materials are electron deficient due to the substitution of an aromatic core with one or two sets of π-accepting imide groups that are mutually conjugated. The widely used rylene diimides include perylene diimides ( PDIs , 1 ) and naphthalene diimides ( NDIs , 2 ) ( Figure 1 ). Zhan and co-workers reported the synthesis of the first soluble rylene-based fully conjugated polymer. 5 Top-gate OFETs based on this PDI- dithienothiophene copolymer exhibited a saturation electron mobility ( μ e ) of 6 x 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , current on / off ratio ( I on / I off ) of 10^4 , and a low threshold voltage ( V th ) of 7 V in air. 6 Moreover , all - polymer solar cells based on blends of polythiophene derivative donors and PDI-dithienothiophene copolymer acceptors exhibited power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as high as 1.5% ( AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 ). 7-9 Facchetti et al. reported a conjugated copolymer of NDI and bithiophene ; 10 OFET devices based on this polymer fabricated in a top-gate , bottom - contact configuration with polymeric dielectrics exhibited μ e of 0.1-0.85 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 under ambient conditions with I on / I off > 10^5 . 11 The simplest aromatic imide system is phthalimide ( 3 ) and thiophene imide ( 4 ) ( Figure 1 ). A few literatures reported phthalimide - containing conjugated polymers such as poly-(phenylene ethynylene)s , 12 a polyaniline derivative , 13 and a polythiophene derivative.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
