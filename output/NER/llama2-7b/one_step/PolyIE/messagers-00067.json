Since the open - circuit voltage V oc of bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs is positively correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , a higher V oc for PzNDTDTBObased polymer solar cells could be anticipated due to the lowerlying HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO. 24 Photovoltaic Properties. To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the NDT - based semiconductor , PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated. Figure 5 shows the current density - voltage characteristic of PSCs based on the blends of polymer : PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW cm^-2 . To further study the performance of the PSC devices , the hole mobilities in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method using devices with structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au at the optimized blend ratio of polymer / PC71BM. For unipolar transport in a trap - free semiconductor with an ohmic injecting contact , the SCLC can be approximated by the Mott - Gurney equation : ε ε μ γ ≅ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ J V L V L 9^8 exp 0.891 r 0^0 2^3 ( 3 ) Here J is the current density , ε r is the dielectric constant of the polymer , ε 0 is the free - space permittivity ( 8.85 × 10^-12 F / m ) , μ 0 is the charge mobility at zero field , γ is a constant , L is the thickness of the blended film layer , V = V appl - V bi , V appl is the applied potential , and V bi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode ( in this device structure , V bi = 0.2 V ). Figure 6 displays the ln(JL 3 / V 2 ) vs ( V / L ) 0.5 curve for the measurement of the hole mobility of the blend films of PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) and PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM ( 1.5 : 1 , w / w ) by the SCLC method. According to eq 3 , the hole mobilities obtained are as high as 3.3 × 10^-3 and 4.4 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO , respectively. Obviously , from the viewpoint of hole mobility , PzNDTDTBO is more suitable ( higher than 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) for the application as photovoltaic donor materials in PSCs.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
