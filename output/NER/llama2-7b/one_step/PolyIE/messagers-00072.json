Make sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 14-16 Recently , it was realized that the weak - donor and strong - acceptor strategy is especially effective , as the weak donor moieties can maintain low HOMO levels while strong acceptor moieties may result in narrow band gap via intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ). 17-19 Another issue needs specific attention consists of the molecular planarity , which may have significant impact on the molecular packing of polymers in solid state and thereby would affect film morphology and charge carrier transport properties. 20-24 We have previously demonstrated a novel naphtho-[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) ( NT ) moiety with enlarged planarity relative to conventionally used acceptor of 2,1,3benzothiadiazole ( BT ) , which can be used as a strong acceptor for D-A polymers. 18 It was found that the NT - based polymers exhibited distinctly improved photovoltaic performances relative to the BT counterparts , which can be attributed to the enhanced carrier mobility and reduced the band gaps. 18 The advantage of D-A type conjugated polymers bears NT as acceptor was also verified by using quaterthiophene or naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene as the donor unit. Such NTbased polymers exhibit 1 order of magnitude increased hole mobility in conjunction with obviously improved photovoltaic properties with respect to the corresponding BT version , which can be ascribed to the centrosymmetric structure of NT that can lead to straighter backbone and more favorable side - chain placement than the axisymmetric BT structure. 25,26 The fact indicates that NT is a versatile acceptor for high performance D-A type of conjugated polymers. Recently , indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) with two thiophene rings held in a rigid arrangement via a central phenyl ring has emerged as a promising donor moiety for D-A polymers due to its good solubility and highly planar structures ( Scheme 1 ). 27-31 Ting et al. synthesized random and alternating copolymers based on IDT and BT and the highest PCE reached 6.4% based on the corresponding PSCs. 28,32,33 Jen et al. studied several high performance D-A copolymers with IDT and different acceptor units. 29,34-37 The IDT - based polymers presented deep HOMO levels and hence lead to considerably high V oc of the resulted devices. Additionally , IDT - based polymers have presented pretty high mobility and the appropriate optical properties , which can facilitate the charge transport together with enhance the absorption of sunlight and subsequently lead to high J sc . 38 Therefore , both IDT and NT are promising building blocks for D-A type low band gap polymers and the combination of the outstanding properties of IDT and NT may develop a series of promising donor materials for high performance PSCs. In this manuscript , we report the synthesis and characterization of three D-A type IDT-NT based low band gap conjugated polymers , poly[2,7-(4,4,9,9-tetra(p-octylphenyl)-s- indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-3,7-(di(4-(2-ethylhex- yl)-2-thienyl)-naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole ) ] ( PIDT - EHNT ) , poly[2,7-(4,4,9,9-tetra(p-octylphenyl)-s- indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-3,7-(di(4-hexyl-2thienyl)-naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole) ] ( PIDT - DTNT ) and poly[2,7-(4,4,9,9-tetra(p-octylphenyl)-s-indaceno-[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-3,7-(di(3′-dodecyl-5-(2,2′-bithienyl))-naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole))] ( PIDT-C12NT ) ( Scheme 2 ) , by using IDT as a weak donor and NT as a strong acceptor.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
