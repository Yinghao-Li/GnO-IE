A new series of PBDTT-DPP-TPD random terpolymers containing two different electron - deficient units ( DPP and TPD ) were synthesized to produce polymers with complementary and broad light absorption from 400 to 900 nm. Through the variation of DPP to TPD composition in the polymers , we successfully tuned the frontier energy levels and illustrated the benefits of this approach in relation to PSC device performance. The optimal ratio of 75 : 25 between DPP and TPD in the random terpolymers enhanced the efficiency of P3 : PC71BM , exhibiting 6.33% due to improved light absorption and thus a J SC value higher than 16 mA / cm^2. In contrast , P5 and P6 with higher TPD contents of 75 and 90% , respectively , exhibited PCE values of 2-3 % , which are significantly lower than those observed for P1 and P7. We found that the optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers could not solely explain this nonlinear compositional dependence. Therefore , we developed a quantitative understanding of the polymer packing structure and the electrical properties using GIXS and DFT , respectively. The DFT calculation results revealed that incorporation of two electron - deficient units changes the electron distribution in the polymer backbone , thus affecting the charge transfer in the PSCs. Consequently , these findings suggest that the design and synthesis of new random terpolymers is a promising way to broaden the absorption of their parent polymers and that optimization of the composition of random terpolymers is critically important to maximize the PSC performance. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Materials and methods , detailed experimental procedures , and additional data.
