The LUMO energy level of PSFDTBT is positioned about 0.80 eV above that of PC71BM ( 4.2 eV , measured under the same condition ) , which offers enough driving force for charge separation and transfer without too much energy loss. 5,17 Transport Properties. The transport properties of the polymer were investigated by fabricating organic thin film fieldeffect transistors ( OFETs ). Typical p-channel field - effect transistor behavior was obtained. The hole mobility ( μ ) was estimated in the saturated regime from the derivative plots of the square root of source - drain current ( I SD ) versus gate voltage ( V G ) through equation 2 where W is the channel width , L is the channel length , C i is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer ( SiO 2 , 500 nm , C i = 7.5 nF / cm^2 ) , and V T is the threshold voltage. The output ( a ) and transfer characteristics ( b ) of the spin - coated PSFDTBT films are shown in Figure 2. The hole mobility of the pristine PSFDTBT film spin - cast from DCB solution is 7.26 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10^5 , which is almost two orders higher than that of P1 ( the hole mobility of pure P1 film is 2 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). 8 Such comparable high mobility is beneficial for charge transfer in the resulting PSCs. 5 For the PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend film ( in a weight ratio of 1 : 3 , spin - coated from ODCB solutions ) , hole mobility ( μ hole ) of 1.14 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and electron mobility ( μ e ) of 2.7 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 were obtained. I SD = ( W / 2L)C i μ(V G - V T ) Photovoltaic Properties. Broad absorption , appropriate HOMO / LUMO positions , and comparable hole mobility make PSFDTBT a promising donor material in BHJ PSCs.

The weight ratio of PSFDTBT to PC71BM and the processing solvent have been carefully optimized. The results are summarized in Table 1.
