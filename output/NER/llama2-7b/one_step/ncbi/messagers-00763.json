Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| CPO gene |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"CPO gene\" is mentioned as the location of the mutation (C to T substitution) in the paragraph. Therefore, it is a disease entity.\n\nNote: I have presented the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph for accuracy."},
