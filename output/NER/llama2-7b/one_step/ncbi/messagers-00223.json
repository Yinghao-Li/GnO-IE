Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Splice-site mutations |\n| Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* (i) Aberrant splicing often generates a premature termination codon: This refers to a genetic mutation that affects the splicing of mRNA, leading to the inclusion of an incorrect termination codon.\n* (ii) Transcripts with premature termination codons can occur at low or undetectable levels due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: This is a process by which cells degrade mRNA that contains premature termination codons, which are no longer able to produce functional proteins.\n* (iii) The levels of these transcripts can be increased by cycloheximide: Cycloheximide is a drug that can block the degradation of mRNA, leading to an increase in the levels of mRNA transcripts with premature termination codons."},
