It is caused by mutations in the COL4A4 gene, which codes for a protein called type IV collagen. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop the condition. Alport syndrome can lead to progressive kidney failure, hearing loss, and vision problems, including retinal detachment and blindness."},
