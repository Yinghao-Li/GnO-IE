Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| HC |\n| CPO gene defects |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"HC\" refers to \"Hemophilia C,\" which is a genetic disorder that affects blood clotting.\n* \"CPO gene defects\" refers to a group of genetic disorders caused by mutations in the CYP21A2 gene, which is responsible for producing the protein cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPO). These disorders include hemophilia C, as well as other bleeding disorders and developmental delays."},
