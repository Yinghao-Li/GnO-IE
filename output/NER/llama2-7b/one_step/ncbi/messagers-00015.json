Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| DMPK |\n| wild-type |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* DMPK stands for \"disease-modifying protein kinase,\" which is a type of disease entity.\n* \"Wild-type\" is a term used in genetics and genomics to refer to the normal or typical form of a gene or protein, as opposed to a mutated or altered form. In this context, \"wild-type\" is used to compare the properties of myotubes from a normal (wild-type) individual to those from an individual with a mutation in the DMPK gene."},
