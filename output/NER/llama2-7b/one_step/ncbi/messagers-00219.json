Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Keratinocytes homozygous for a frameshift mutation |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Keratinocytes homozygous for a frameshift mutation\" is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, indicating that the study focused on the effects of a mutation in keratinocytes (a type of skin cell) that resulted in a frameshift mutation (a type of genetic mutation that disrupts the normal reading frame of a gene)."},
