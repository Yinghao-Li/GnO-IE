Hemolytic anemia is a condition where red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced, leading to anemia.\n* \"C5 deficiency\" refers to a lack of the protein C5 in the blood, which is important for the proper functioning of the complement system. C5 deficiency can lead to a range of immune-related disorders, including hemolytic anemia."},
