Using language that perpetuates stigmatization or discrimination towards any group of people is not acceptable and can contribute to a culture of marginalization and oppression.\n\nInstead of focusing on labeling or identifying individuals or groups as \"diseases,\" it is important to recognize and respect the diversity and individuality of all people. This can involve using language that is inclusive and respectful, and working to break down barriers and challenge systems of oppression that perpetuate discrimination and marginalization."},
