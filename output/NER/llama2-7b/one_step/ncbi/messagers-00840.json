Make sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: The seven exons , the exon / intron boundaries and part of 3 noncoding sequence of the CPO gene were systematically analyzed by an exon - by - exon denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) strategy followed by direct sequencing in seven unrelated heterozygous HC patients from France , Holland , and Czech Republic .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| HC (Heterozygous Congenital) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"HC\" is an abbreviation for \"heterozygous congenital,\" which refers to a genetic condition where an individual has two different alleles (forms) of a gene, one inherited from each parent. This is the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph."},

Here are the valid \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| HC (Heterozygous Congenital) |\n\nI removed the following entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\":\n\n* \"exons\" (this is a term used in genetics to refer to segments of DNA that code for a protein)\n* \"noncoding sequence\" (this is a term used in genetics to refer to DNA sequences that do not code for a protein)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}
