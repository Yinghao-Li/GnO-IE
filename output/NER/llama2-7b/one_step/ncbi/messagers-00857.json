Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| ARSA |\n| GS levels |\n| disease |\n\nNote that the term \"disease\" is used in a general sense in the paragraph, referring to any pathological condition caused by the mutations mentioned. However, the specific disease entities mentioned are:\n\n* ARSA (Acid-RNA-binding Stem-loop Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase)\n* GS levels (Glycosylation levels)\n\nI hope this helps!
