Myocardial infarction: This is a type of heart attack that occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle.\n2. Isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction: This is a specific type of myocardial infarction that is caused by the drug isoproterenol. Isoproterenol is a beta-adrenergic agonist that is used to treat certain heart conditions, but it can also cause cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarction in some cases."},
