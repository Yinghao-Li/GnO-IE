Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Bile diversion |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Bile diversion refers to the surgical diversion of bile flow away from the liver and gallbladder, which can be done to induce bile salt (BS) synthesis in rats. This is considered a disease entity because it is a manipulation of the normal bile flow and can have an impact on the bile salt synthesis pathways."},
