Here are the entities I found:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Mesna |\n| IFO |\n| SCEs |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Mesna is a drug or treatment mentioned in the paragraph, which suggests that it is a disease entity.\n* IFO is another drug or treatment mentioned in the paragraph, which also suggests that it is a disease entity.\n* SCEs stands for \"Spermatogenic Cell Explant\" which is a laboratory technique used to study the development of spermatogenic cells. It is not a disease entity, but rather a laboratory procedure.\n\nSo, the only disease entities in the paragraph are Mesna and IFO."},
