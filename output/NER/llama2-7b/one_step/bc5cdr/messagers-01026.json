Here are the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| logistic model |\n| potential confounding factors |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"logistic model\" is a mathematical model used in statistics to analyze the relationship between two categorical variables. It is not a chemical entity.\n* \"potential confounding factors\" is a term used in epidemiology to describe variables that could affect the outcome of a study and are not accounted for in the analysis. It is not a chemical entity."},
