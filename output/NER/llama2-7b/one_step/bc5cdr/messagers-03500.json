Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hypertension |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Over the total postinfusion period systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 6 (SEM 2)% and 7 (2)% higher than after dextrose infusion (ANOVA, p less than 0.001).\"\n\nIn this paragraph, the term \"hypertension\" is used to describe a condition in which the blood pressure is elevated. The phrase \"total postinfusion period\" refers to the time period after an infusion of a substance, in this case, dextrose. The terms \"systolic\" and \"diastolic\" refer to specific measurements of blood pressure, with \"systolic\" referring to the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and \"diastolic\" referring to the pressure in the arteries between beats. The phrase \"ANOVA, p less than 0.001\" indicates that the difference in blood pressure between the dextrose infusion and the postinfusion period was statistically significant at a level of less than 0.001."},
