Here are the entities I found:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hemodynamic effects |\n| Histamine release |\n\nIn the paragraph, the term \"hemodynamic effects\" refers to the changes in blood flow and blood pressure that occur as a result of the injection of d-tubocurarine. The term \"histamine release\" refers to the release of histamine from the body's immune system in response to the injection.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
