Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hyperprolactinemia |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Hyperprolactinemia is a disease characterized by an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that plays a role in lactation and breast development, among other functions. In this study, the researchers induced hyperprolactinemia in rats for extended periods of time to examine its effects on dopaminergic systems in the brain."},
