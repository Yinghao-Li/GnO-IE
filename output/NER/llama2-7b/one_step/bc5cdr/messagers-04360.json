Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hypertension (high blood pressure) |\n| Heart rate |\n| Neural system (central nervous system) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Hypertension\" refers to high blood pressure, which is a common cardiovascular disease that can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems.\n* \"Heart rate\" refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute, which can be affected by various factors, including the autonomic nervous system.\n* \"Neural system (central nervous system)\" refers to the network of nerve cells and fibers that carries information between different parts of the body, including the brain and the cardiovascular system. In this context, the central nervous system is involved in regulating blood pressure and heart rate."},
