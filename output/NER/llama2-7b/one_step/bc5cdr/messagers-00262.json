Here are the valid entities in the paragraph, presented in a Markdown table with one column titled \"Disease\":\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) |\n| Ulcer |\n| Fever |\n| Polyarthralgia |\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN): This is a type of vasculitis, a condition where the blood vessels become inflamed. In this paragraph, the patient developed PAN, which is characterized by the presence of oral ulcers and polyarthralgia (joint pain).\n2. Ulcer: An ulcer is a break in the skin or mucous membrane that can be caused by various factors, including infection, injury, or inflammation.
