Hypercalcemia: This is the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. Hypercalcemia is a condition characterized by an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood.\n2. Hemodialysis: This is a medical treatment mentioned in the paragraph. Hemodialysis is a process in which blood is filtered outside the body using a dialyzer, which is a machine that replicates the function of the kidneys.\n3. Calcium carbonate therapy: This is the medical treatment mentioned in the paragraph that is associated with the development of hypercalcemia in hemodialysis patients. Calcium carbonate is a type of medication that is used to treat conditions such as hypercalcemia."},
