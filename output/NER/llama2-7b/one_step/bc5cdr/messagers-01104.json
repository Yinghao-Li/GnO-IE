Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Renal tubular injury | NAG (a marker of renal tubular injury) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Renal malondialdehyde (MDA) is a biomarker of oxidative stress, which can be indicative of various kidney diseases.\n* Urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) is a marker of renal tubular injury, which can be caused by various diseases such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and nephrotoxicity.\n* Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) are enzymes involved in antioxidant defense mechanisms, which can be affected in various diseases, including kidney diseases."},
