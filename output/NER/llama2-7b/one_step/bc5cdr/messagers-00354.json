Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| PDN (Parkinson's disease) |\n\nIn the paragraph, the term \"PDN\" refers to Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. The paragraph compares the number of stained microglia cells in the prefrontal cortex of mice treated with different doses of PDN to those in control mice, and finds that the number of stained cells is significantly higher in the treated groups."},
