Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer |\n\nIn this paragraph, the term \"disease\" appears twice, referring to two different conditions:\n\n1. Metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer: This is the primary disease being studied in the trial. It is a type of prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) and is resistant to androgens (androgen-independent).\n2. Prostate cancer: This is a broader term that refers to any cancer that originates in the prostate gland. While the paragraph specifically mentions metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer, the term \"prostate cancer\" is used more generally to refer to any type of prostate cancer."},
