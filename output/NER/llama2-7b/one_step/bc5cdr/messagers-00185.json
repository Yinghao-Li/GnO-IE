Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Schizophrenia |\n| Schizoaffective disorder |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Olanzapine\" is a medication used to treat schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.\n* \"Y-MRS\" is an abbreviation for the \"Young Man's Rating Scale,\" which is a scale used to assess the severity of symptoms of schizophrenia.\n* \"Placebo\" is a medication that has no active therapeutic effect, used as a control in clinical trials to compare the effectiveness of a new medication.\n\nSo, the two diseases mentioned in the paragraph are schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder."},
