Here are the \"Chemical\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| media |\n| vacuoles |\n| herniations |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"media\" refers to the medium or substance in which something exists or is found. In this case, it refers to the small arteries in question.\n* \"vacuoles\" are small, hollow structures within cells that contain fluid or other substances. In the context of the paragraph, they are identified as intracellular vacuoles.\n* \"herniations\" refers to the bulging or protrusion of one cell into another. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the herniations of smooth muscle cells into each other.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
