Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hypertension (SHR) |\n| Normotensive (WKY) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Hypertension\" refers to high blood pressure, which is a disease characterized by elevated blood pressure levels in the arteries.\n* \"Normotensive\" refers to rats that have normal blood pressure levels, which is the opposite of hypertension.\n\nI hope this helps!
