Here are the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| hypokinesis |\n| atrial conduction deficit |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"hypokinesis\" refers to a decrease in muscle movement or contraction.\n* \"atrial conduction deficit\" refers to a problem with the electrical signals that travel through the heart's atria, which can cause abnormal heart rhythms."},
