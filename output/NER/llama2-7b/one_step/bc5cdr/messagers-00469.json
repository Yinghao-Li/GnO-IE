Here are the \"Chemical\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| persistent sterile leukocyturia |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Persistent\" refers to something that continues over a long period of time. In this context, it modifies the term \"sterile leukocyturia\", which refers to the presence of white blood cells in the urine without any signs of infection.\n* \"Leukocyturia\" is the term used to describe the presence of white blood cells in the urine.\n\nI hope this helps!
