Here are the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance |\n\nThe phrase \"deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance\" refers to a decline in the function of the left ventricle (LV), which is a type of heart muscle that plays a crucial role in pumping blood throughout the body. This deterioration can lead to various cardiovascular problems, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and increased risk of heart attack or stroke."},
