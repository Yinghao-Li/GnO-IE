Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hyperprolactinemia |\n| Pituitary dysfunction |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Hyperprolactinemia: This is a condition characterized by an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood.\n* Pituitary dysfunction: This refers to any abnormality or disorder affecting the pituitary gland, which is a small endocrine gland located at the base of the brain that regulates various bodily functions. In the context of the paragraph, \"pituitary dysfunction\" likely refers to the abolished pituitary response to LH-RH, which is a hormone that stimulates the pituitary gland to produce hormones."},
