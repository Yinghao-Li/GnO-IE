    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I can help you identify the disease entities in the given paragraph. Here are the valid entities:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Breast modifications |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Symptomatology refers to the study of symptoms, which are the subjective experiences or sensations that a patient feels. In this context, it is possible that the patient is experiencing symptoms related to a breast disease.\n* Physical examination refers to a medical examination of the body, including the breasts, to check for any abnormalities or changes. This could be related to a breast disease.\n* Plate thermography refers to a medical imaging technique that uses thermal imaging to detect changes in the temperature of the body. This could be related to a breast disease, such as inflammation or cancer.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"Breast modifications\"."},
