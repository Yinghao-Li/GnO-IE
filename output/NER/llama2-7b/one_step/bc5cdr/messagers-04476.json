Here are the disease entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Bladder irritation |\n| Neuronal nitric oxide synthase |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Bladder irritation: This is the condition in which the bladder is inflamed or irritated, leading to discomfort or pain.\n* Neuronal nitric oxide synthase: This is an enzyme that is involved in the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that plays a role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of blood flow and immune responses. In the context of the paragraph, increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in bladder afferent pathways suggests that there is an increase in the production of nitric oxide in the bladder, which may be related to the chronic bladder irritation."},
