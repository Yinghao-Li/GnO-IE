In this context, \"homozygous (jj)\" refers to an individual that is homozygous for the gene \"jj\".\n* \"Heterozygous\" is a term used in genetics to describe an individual that has two different copies of a gene, one inherited from each parent. In this context, \"heterozygous (jJ)\" refers to an individual that is heterozygous for the gene \"jJ\"."},
