Here are the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias |\n| AV nodal reentry |\n\nIn the paragraph, the term \"tachyarrhythmias\" refers to a group of heart rhythm disorders characterized by rapid heart rates. Within this group, the term \"supraventricular\" refers to the location of the arrhythmia in the atria or atrioventricular (AV) node.\n\nThe term \"AV nodal reentry\" is a specific type of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, where the arrhythmia originates in the AV node and involves a reentry circuit."},
