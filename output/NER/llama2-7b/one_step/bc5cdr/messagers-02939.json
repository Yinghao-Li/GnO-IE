Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Myocardial contrast enhancement |\n| Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) |\n| Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) |\n\nIn this paragraph, the following disease entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Myocardial contrast enhancement: This refers to an increase in the contrast agent used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart, which can indicate inflammation or damage to the myocardium (the muscular layer of the heart wall).\n2. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI): This is a protein released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged or stressed, as occurs in conditions such as myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n3. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): This is a measure of the heart's pumping function, which can be affected by various cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

I have removed \"Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)\" as it is not a disease entity, but rather a measure of the heart's pumping function."}
