This is a protein that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the liver.\n* ERK1/2: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2. These are protein kinases that are involved in various cellular signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK pathway, which is activated in response to various extracellular signals, including growth factors and hormones."},
