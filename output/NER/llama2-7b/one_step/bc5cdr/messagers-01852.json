Here are the disease entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| 6-OHDA |\n| DA neurons |\n| PENK |\n| CPu |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* 6-OHDA: 6-Hydroxydopamine is a toxic compound that can induce lesions in the brain and is often used as a model for studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.\n* DA neurons: Dopamine neurons are a type of neuron in the brain that are involved in movement and reward processing.\n* PENK: Penk is a gene that encodes for the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, which is involved in the metabolism of glucose and is upregulated in certain neurodegenerative diseases.\n* CPu: The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is a region of the midbrain that contains dopamine neurons and is affected in Parkinson's disease. In the context of the paragraph, \"CPu\" is likely a typo or abbreviation for \"SNc\"."},
