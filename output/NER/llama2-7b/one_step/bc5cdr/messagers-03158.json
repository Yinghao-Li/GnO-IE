Here are the disease entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| STZ-induced memory impairment |\n| Castration-induced memory impairment |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* STZ stands for Streptozotocin, which is a toxic compound used to induce diabetes in laboratory animals. In this context, STZ-induced memory impairment refers to the memory impairment caused by diabetes.\n* Castration-induced memory impairment refers to the memory impairment caused by the removal of testes, which are responsible for producing testosterone in male animals."},
