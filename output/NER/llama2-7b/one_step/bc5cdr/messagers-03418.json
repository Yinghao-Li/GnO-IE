Here are the valid disease entities I found:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Latent disease |\n| Arsenic exposure |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Latent disease\" is a term used to describe a disease that is present but not currently manifesting itself, often due to a dormant or inactive infection.\n* \"Arsenic exposure\" is a disease entity that refers to the exposure of a living organism to the toxic metal arsenic, which can cause a range of health problems.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
