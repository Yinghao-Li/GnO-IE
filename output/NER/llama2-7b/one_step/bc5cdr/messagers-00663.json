Phagocytosis: This is the process of engulfing and digesting foreign particles or cellular debris by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages.\n2. Fat necrosis: This is the term used to describe the death of fat cells due to various factors, such as inflammation, infection, or trauma.\n\nI hope this helps!
