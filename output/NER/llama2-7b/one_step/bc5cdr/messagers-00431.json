Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| DBA / 2 |\n| C57BL / 6 |\n| CY |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* DBA / 2: Inbred refers to the breeding history of the mice, where they have been bred within a limited gene pool to produce a genetically uniform population. DBA / 2 is a specific strain of inbred mouse.\n* C57BL / 6: C57BL / 6 is another strain of inbred mouse.\n* CY: CY is the drug being tested for its effect on the bladder. It is not a disease entity."},
