Torsades de pointes: This is a type of abnormal heart rhythm, specifically a ventricular tachycardia with a specific pattern of QRS complexes on the electrocardiogram (ECG).\n2. Sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias: This refers to a group of heart rhythm disorders characterized by a rapid and regular heartbeat that originates in the ventricles.\n\nI hope this helps!
