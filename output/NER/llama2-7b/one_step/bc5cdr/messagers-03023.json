Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Thrombosis |\n| Stroke |\n| Venous thromboembolism (VTE) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Postthrombectomy continuous CDT with alteplase\" refers to a medical treatment for thrombosis, specifically postthrombotic CDT (continuous flow direct thrombin inhibition) with the drug alteplase.\n* \"Alteplase\" is a specific drug used to treat thrombosis, particularly acute ischemic stroke.\n* \"SVC\" stands for superior vena cava, which is a central vein that drains blood from the head, neck, and upper limbs into the right atrium of the heart.\n* \"Central veins\" refers to the veins that drain blood from the body into the heart.\n* \"Patency\" means the state of being open and unobstructed, so \"complete patency of the SVC and central veins\" means that these veins are completely open and unblocked.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
