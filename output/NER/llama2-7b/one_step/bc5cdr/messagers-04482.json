Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| CYP |\n| NOS |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"CYP\" is an abbreviation for \"cytotoxic effect,\" which is not a disease entity in itself, but rather a effect of a toxic substance on cells.\n* \"NOS\" stands for \"nitric oxide synthase,\" which is an enzyme involved in the production of nitric oxide, a signaling molecule in the body. In this context, \"NOS-immunoreactive\" refers to the presence of nitric oxide synthase in the neurons.\n\nSo, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"CYP.\""},
