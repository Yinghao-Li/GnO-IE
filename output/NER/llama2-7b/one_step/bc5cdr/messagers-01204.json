Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hypertension |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Experimental hypertension\" is a disease state created by removing NO, which is a vasodilator that helps to relax and widen blood vessels.\n* \"Hypertension\" is a broader term that refers to high blood pressure, which can be caused by a variety of factors. In this context, experimental hypertension is a specific type of hypertension that is induced by removing NO."},
