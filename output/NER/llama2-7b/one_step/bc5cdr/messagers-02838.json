Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Dex-induced hypertension |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Dex\" is an abbreviation for \"dexamethasone,\" which is a synthetic glucocorticoid that is commonly used as a model drug to induce hypertension in animal models.\n* \"Dex-induced hypertension\" refers to high blood pressure caused by the administration of dexamethasone.\n\nI hope this helps!
