Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| None |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Forty healthy subjects\" means that all the participants in the study were healthy, so there is no disease present.\n* \"Prospective\" means that the study was designed to look at the outcome of a particular event or situation in the future, which does not imply any disease.\n* \"Randomized\" means that the participants were assigned to different groups by chance, which does not imply any disease.\n* \"Double-blind\" means that neither the participants nor the researchers knew which group the participants were assigned to, which does not imply any disease.\n* \"Placebo-controlled\" means that one group of participants received a placebo (a dummy treatment with no active ingredients) and the other group received the actual treatment being studied, which does not imply any disease.\n\nSo, in summary, there is no disease present in the paragraph."},
