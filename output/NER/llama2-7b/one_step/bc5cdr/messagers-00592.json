Here are the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| chloride |\n| depolarisation |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Chloride\" is a chemical element with the symbol Cl and atomic number 17. It is a major anion in the body and plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including muscle function.\n* \"Depolarisation\" is a process in which the membrane potential of a cell becomes more positive, leading to the opening of ion channels and the influx of ions. In the context of muscle function, depolarisation is important for muscle contraction."},
