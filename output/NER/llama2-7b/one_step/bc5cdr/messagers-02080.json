Here are the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph you provided:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| ZnSO (4) |\n| BCNU |\n\nIn the paragraph, the following chemical entities are mentioned:\n\n* ZnSO (4): This is likely a typo or error in the text, as there is no such chemical compound as \"ZnSO (4)\". Zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) is a common compound, but the number in parentheses after the \"Zn\" is not a valid chemical formula.\n* BCNU: This is the valid chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph, which stands for \"N-methyl-N-nitroso-guanidine\"."},
