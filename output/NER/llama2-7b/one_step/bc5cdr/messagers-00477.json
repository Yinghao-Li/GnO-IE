Here are the valid disease entities in the paragraph, presented in a Markdown table with one column titled \"Disease\":\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Nephrotoxicity |\n| Sterile leukocyturia |\n| Age < 5 years |\n| Persistent sterile leukocyturia |\n| C (max) > 12 mg/L |\n\nIn the paragraph, the following disease entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Nephrotoxicity: This refers to damage to the kidneys, which can occur as a side effect of indinavir treatment.\n2. Sterile leukocyturia: This is a condition where there is an abnormal increase in white blood cells in the urine, which can be a sign of kidney damage.\n3. Age < 5 years: This is a risk factor for nephrotoxicity in children, as their kidneys may be more susceptible to damage from indinavir.\n4. Persistent sterile leukocyturia: This is a condition where there is a persistent increase in white blood cells in the urine, which can be a sign of ongoing kidney damage.\n5. C (max) > 12 mg/L: This refers to the maximum concentration of indinavir in the blood, which can also be a risk factor for nephrotoxicity."},
