In this case, the diseases mentioned are:\n\n* Tumor cell proliferation: This refers to the uncontrolled growth and division of abnormal cells, which can lead to the formation of tumors.\n* Apoptotic tumor cells: This refers to the process of programmed cell death, which is a normal process that occurs in cells throughout the body. In the context of cancer, apoptosis can be a mechanism by which cancer cells are eliminated."},
