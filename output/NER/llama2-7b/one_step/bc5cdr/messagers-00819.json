Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| MA (Methamphetamine) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Cortical maps\" refers to a type of neuroimaging technique used to study the brain.\n* \"Revealed\" is a verb that implies the existence or presence of something, in this case, abnormalities in the brain.\n* \"Severe gray matter deficits\" refers to a reduction in the amount of gray matter in certain areas of the brain, which can be indicative of various neurological disorders.\n* \"Cingulate,\" \"limbic,\" and \"paralimbic\" are all terms that refer to specific regions of the brain.\n* \"MA abusers\" refers to individuals who have used methamphetamine, a highly addictive and dangerous drug that can have severe effects on the brain and body.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
