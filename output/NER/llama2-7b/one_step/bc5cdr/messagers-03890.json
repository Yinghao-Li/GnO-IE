Here are the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\":\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| fibrinolytic disorders |\n| disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) |\n| consumption coagulopathies |\n| thrombosis of a normal renal artery |\n| subtotal infarction of the kidney |\n\nIn the paragraph, the following disease entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Fibrinolytic disorders: This refers to a group of conditions that affect the body's ability to break down blood clots.\n2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): This is a condition where blood clots form throughout the body, leading to damage to multiple organs and tissues.\n3. Consumption coagulopathies: This term is not commonly used in modern medical literature, but it appears to refer to a group of conditions where the body's coagulation system is overactive and leads to excessive blood clotting.\n4. Thrombosis of a normal renal artery: This is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel that supplies blood to the kidney.\n5. Subtotal infarction of the kidney: This is a condition where part of the kidney is damaged due to a lack of blood supply, leading to impaired kidney function."},
