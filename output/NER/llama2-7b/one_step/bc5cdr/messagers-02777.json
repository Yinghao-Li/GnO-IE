Here are the entities I found:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Cardiotoxicity |\n| Epirubicine-based chemotherapy |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Cardiotoxicity: This is the disease entity that the paragraph is focusing on. It refers to the damage or injury to the heart muscle or cardiovascular system caused by a drug, such as epirubicine, during chemotherapy.\n* Epirubicine-based chemotherapy: This is the specific type of chemotherapy that is causing the cardiotoxicity.\n\nI hope this helps!
