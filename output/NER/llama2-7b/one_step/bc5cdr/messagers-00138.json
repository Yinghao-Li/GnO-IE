Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Urea toxicity |\n| Creatinine toxicity |\n| AmB (D-AmB) toxicity |\n| NS-718 toxicity |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Serum blood urea and creatinine concentrations increased significantly in rats given an iv infusion of D - AmB 3 mg / kg\" - This sentence suggests that the rats were given a dose of D-AmB, which led to an increase in urea and creatinine concentrations in their blood.\n* \"but not in those given the same dose of NS - 718\" - This sentence implies that the rats given NS-718 did not experience the same increase in urea and creatinine concentrations as the rats given D-AmB.\n\nTherefore, the two diseases identified in the paragraph are:\n\n* Urea toxicity\n* Creatinine toxicity\n\nNote that \"AmB\" and \"NS-718\" are not diseases, but rather drug names."},
