Here are the disease entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Seizures |\n| Cognitive impairment |\n| Brain oxidative stress markers |\n\nIn the paragraph, the following disease entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Seizures: This refers to a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can lead to convulsions, loss of consciousness, and other symptoms.\n2. Cognitive impairment: This refers to a decline in cognitive function, including memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities, often associated with aging or neurological disorders.\n3. Brain oxidative stress markers: This refers to measures of oxidative stress in the brain, which can be indicative of damage to brain cells and tissues, and may contribute to the development of various neurological disorders."},
