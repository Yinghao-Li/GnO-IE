Here are the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| hypothalamic |\n| pituitary |\n| adrenal |\n| ecstasy |\n| polydrug |\n\nNote: I have included the word \"ecstasy\" as a chemical entity, as it is a psychoactive substance that can affect the HPA axis. However, it is important to note that \"ecstasy\" is a colloquial term that can refer to the drug MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which is a controlled substance that can have serious adverse effects on the brain and body.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
