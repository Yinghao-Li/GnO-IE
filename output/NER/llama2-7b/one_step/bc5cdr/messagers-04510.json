Here are the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Neurodegenerative disorder |\n| Dementia |\n| Parkinson's disease |\n| Apomorphine |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Neurodegenerative disorder\" is a broad term that refers to a group of diseases that affect the brain and spinal cord, leading to progressive loss of neural function and death of neurons. Examples of neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.\n* \"Dementia\" is a term that refers to a group of symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with communication and problem-solving. Dementia can be caused by a variety of underlying diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and Lewy body dementia.\n* \"Parkinson's disease\" is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. It is characterized by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra, leading to tremors, rigidity, and difficulty with movement.\n* \"Apomorphine\" is a drug that is used to treat Parkinson's disease. It works by increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain, which can help to improve movement and reduce symptoms of the disease."},
