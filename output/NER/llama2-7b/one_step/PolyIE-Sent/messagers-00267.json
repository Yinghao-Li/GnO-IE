While it is related to material properties, it is not a direct measure of a material property value.\n* \"carrier mobility\" - This term refers to the ability of charge carriers (such as electrons or holes) to move through a material, which can affect the material's electrical conductivity. While it is related to material properties, it is not a direct measure of a material property value."
