Molecular weight: This is a property value that refers to the mass of a single molecule of the substance. It is typically measured in units of grams per mole (g/mol).\n2. Thermal properties: This is a property value that refers to the behavior of the substance when it is exposed to heat. Thermal properties can include melting point, boiling point, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity, among others.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
