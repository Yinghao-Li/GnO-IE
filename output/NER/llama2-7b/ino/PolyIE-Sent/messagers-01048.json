Mainchain D-A conjugated polymers\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"Side-chain donor-acceptor (D-A) polymer\" is a specific type of polymer that is characterized by the presence of side chains that donate electrons and acceptors that accept electrons. This type of polymer is being compared to a broader category of polymers called \"mainchain D-A conjugated polymers.\"\n2. \"Mainchain D-A conjugated polymers\" refer to a class of polymers that have a backbone structure with alternating double bonds (conjugated backbone) and side chains that donate electrons (donor) and accept electrons (acceptor). This type of polymer is being compared to the specific type of polymer mentioned in the paragraph, which has better solution processability, lower HOMO level, and more balanced carrier mobility."
