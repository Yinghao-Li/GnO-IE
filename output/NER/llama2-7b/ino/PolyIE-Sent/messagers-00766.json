LUMO: The term \"LUMO\" is a chemical concept that refers to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital in a molecule. It is a specific type of molecular orbital that is used to describe the electronic structure of a molecule. Therefore, \"LUMO\" can be considered a material name entity.\n2. electron: The term \"electron\" is a fundamental entity in chemistry that refers to the negatively charged subatomic particle that resides in an atom. It is a material name entity.\n3. electron-withdrawing units: The term \"electron-withdrawing units\" is a chemical concept that refers to groups of atoms or functionalities in a molecule that withdraw electrons from the molecular orbitals. It is a material name entity."
