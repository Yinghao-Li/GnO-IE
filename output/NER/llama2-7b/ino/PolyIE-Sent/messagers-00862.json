In this context, it is likely that the polymers being referred to are the polymers that are being studied or compared in the absorption spectra.\n2. \"PC71BM\" is a specific material that is mentioned in the paragraph. \"PC71BM\" is likely an abbreviation for a specific type of organic material, possibly a conjugated polymer or a blend of materials. The abbreviation is not commonly used in the scientific literature, so it may be a proprietary or trade name for a specific material."

EQE responses: EQE stands for External Quantum Efficiency, and it refers to the efficiency of a photovoltaic material in converting incident light into electrical current. The EQE responses in this context refer to the efficiency of the polymers and PC71BM in converting light into electrical current.\n3. Visible region: This refers to the range of wavelengths that can be seen by the human eye, typically between 400-700 nanometers.
