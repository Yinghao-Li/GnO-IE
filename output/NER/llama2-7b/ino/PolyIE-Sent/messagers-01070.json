Absorption spectrum: This refers to the range of wavelengths of light that a material absorbs.\n2. Peak: A peak refers to the highest point or maximum value of a waveform or a curve. In this context, it refers to the absorption peak, which is the wavelength at which the material absorbs the most light.\n3. Energy: Energy refers to the amount of work that is required to move a charge from one point to another. In this context, it refers to the energy of the absorbed light.\n4. Red-shift: Red-shift refers to the phenomenon where the absorption peak of a material shifts to longer wavelengths as the material is heated or exposed to higher energy radiation.\n5. Shoulder: A shoulder refers to a secondary peak or a less pronounced peak that is present in addition to the main peak in an absorption spectrum. In this context, it refers to the additional shoulder that is observed in the solid film's absorption spectrum."
