Copolymers: The paragraph specifically mentions \"copolymers\" as the material being compared, so it can be identified as a Material Name entity.\n2. DPP: The paragraph mentions \"other DPP-based copolymers\" in comparison to the two copolymers being discussed, which suggests that DPP is a specific type of copolymer. Without further context, it is not possible to identify the exact name of the DPP copolymer being referred to."
