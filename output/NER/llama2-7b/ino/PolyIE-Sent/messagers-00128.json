Band gap: The term \"band gap\" refers to a range of energy levels in a solid where no electrons are present. It is a fundamental concept in solid-state physics and materials science, and it is often used to describe the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in a solid. In the context of the paragraph, the increase in the band gap is being discussed, which means that the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band has increased.\n2. Molecular orbital (LUMO): The term \"molecular orbital\" refers to a quantum mechanical concept that describes the distribution of electrons within a molecule. In the context of the paragraph, the LUMO energy level is being referred to, which is the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital in the material.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"band gap\" and \"molecular orbital (LUMO)\"."
