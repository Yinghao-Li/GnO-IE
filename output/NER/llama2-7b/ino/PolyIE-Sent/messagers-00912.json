Polymer backbone: The term \"polymer backbone\" refers to the main chain of repeating units that make up the polymer molecule.\n2. Aromatic units: The term \"aromatic units\" refers to the individual repeating units that are composed of a planar, unsaturated ring of carbon atoms, typically with alternating double bonds.\n3. Side chains: The term \"side chains\" refers to the additional chemical groups that are attached to the polymer backbone, which can be functionalized with various chemical groups to enhance the polymer's properties."
