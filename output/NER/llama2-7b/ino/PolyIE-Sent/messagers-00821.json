GPC data\n\nHere's a breakdown of each entity and how it fits into the context of the paragraph:\n\n1. Molecular weights: This is the property being measured or observed in the GPC analysis. The molecular weights of the polymers are being determined by the GPC method.\n2. Polymers: This is the type of material being analyzed in the GPC experiment. The polymers are the substances whose molecular weights are being measured.\n3. THF solution: This is the solvent or medium in which the GPC analysis is being performed. The polymers are dissolved in THF in order to perform the GPC measurement.\n4. Polystyrene standards: These are reference materials used to calibrate the GPC instrument. The polystyrene standards are used to determine the response of the GPC instrument and to convert the GPC data into a molecular weight scale.\n5. GPC data: This is the data generated by the GPC analysis. The GPC data includes information about the molecular weights of the polymers, as well as other properties such as the molecular weight distribution and the polydispersity index.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
