Thiophene: Thiophene is an organosulfur compound with the chemical formula C4H4S. It is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon that is structurally similar to benzene, but with a sulfur atom replacing one of the carbon atoms. Thiophene is a common building block for the synthesis of conjugated polymers, which are important for organic photovoltaics (OPVs).\n2. Thiophene-fused aromatic system polymers: These are polymers that contain thiophene units fused with other aromatic rings. The term \"fused\" refers to the chemical bond between the thiophene and the other aromatic ring, which creates a conjugated structure. Thiophene-fused aromatic system polymers are also important for OPVs due to their excellent electronic properties."

In this context, the term \"thiophene\" is used to describe a specific type of aromatic hydrocarbon that is being compared to other similar compounds.\n2. \"thiophene-fused aromatic system\" is a type of polymer structure that is formed by fusing multiple thiophene units together. This type of structure is often used in the synthesis of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) because it can provide a high degree of flexibility and versatility in terms of the types of materials that can be used.\n3. \"OPVs\" are devices that convert light into electricity using organic materials. In this context, the term \"OPVs\" is used to describe a specific type of device that is being compared to other similar devices.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. thiophene\n2. thiophene-fused aromatic system\n3.
