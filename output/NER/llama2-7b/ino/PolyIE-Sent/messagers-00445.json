In this context, it is likely that the specific type of polymer being referred to is a synthetic or natural polymer used in the blend films.\n2. \"PC71BM\" is a specific material name that refers to a particular type of organic photovoltaic (OPV) material. It is a blend of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester)."
