Benzodithiophene (BDT) is a specific type of molecule mentioned in the paragraph as a comparison to the IDT (indacenodithiophene) unit.\n2. Poly-mers (PBDT-DTNT) refers to a class of polymers that contain the BDT unit.\n3. Polymers (PSCs) is a general term used to refer to a class of materials that are composed of long chains of repeating molecular units. In this context, the authors are discussing the potential of PSCs based on the target polymers, which are anticipated to have high V oc and deep HOMO levels due to the IDT unit."
