In the given paragraph, the author is comparing the properties of two different copolymers.\n2. Polymers: The term \"polymers\" refers to a broader class of materials that includes copolymers, as well as other types of polymers such as homopolymers (which are composed of a single monomer) and blends (which are composed of two or more different polymers). In the given paragraph, the author is comparing the properties of two different copolymers, which are both types of polymers."
