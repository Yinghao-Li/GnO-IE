DPP and TPD are properties of the random terpolymers that are being studied. DPP refers to the direct proportional relationship between the molecular weight of the terpolymer and the molecular weight of the monomers, while TPD refers to the deviation from this direct proportional relationship.\n2. 1H NMR spectroscopy is a technique used to measure the chemical shift and coupling constants of atomic nuclei in a molecule, which can provide information about the molecular structure and properties of the terpolymers.\n3. elemental analysis is a type of analysis that determines the chemical composition of a substance by measuring the relative abundance of different elements present in the substance. In this context, elemental analysis is used to determine the chemical composition of the terpolymers.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are DPP, TPD, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis."
