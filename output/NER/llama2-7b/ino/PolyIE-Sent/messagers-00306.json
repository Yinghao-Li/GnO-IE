V OC (Voltage On Current): This is another important property value of a material, which represents the voltage required to move a unit of current through the material. In this paragraph, the high V OC of PCDTBT is being highlighted as an advantage.\n\nTherefore, the two property values mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Bandgap\n2. V OC"
