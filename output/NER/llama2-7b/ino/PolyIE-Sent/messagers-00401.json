Absorption maxima: The term \"absorption maxima\" refers to the points at which the absorption of light by the polymer solutions is greatest. These points are typically associated with specific wavelengths of light, and can be used to identify the presence of specific chemical species in the solution.\n2. Edges: The term \"edges\" refers to the boundaries between different regions of the absorption spectrum. In the context of the paragraph, the edges are likely referring to the boundaries between the absorption maxima.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"absorption maxima\" and \"edges\"."
