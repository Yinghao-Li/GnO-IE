Copolymers: The paragraph mentions two copolymers that were studied, indicating that these are the materials being referred to.\n2. Peak: The paragraph mentions a characteristic diffraction peak in the range of 3-5 ° and a weak diffraction peak in the range of 15-20 °, which are both referred to as \"peaks\".\n3. Diffraction peak: This is a specific type of peak that appears in the diffraction pattern of a material, indicating the spacing of the crystal lattice planes.\n4. (100): This is a Miller index, which is used to describe the crystal structure of a material. In this case, (100) refers to the crystal plane with a spacing of 100 Å.\n5. (010): This is another Miller index, which refers to the crystal plane with a spacing of 010 Å.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"Copolymers\", \"Peak\", \"Diffraction peak\", \"(100)\", and \"(010)\"."
