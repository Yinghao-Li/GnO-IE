Determine whether each noun is a Property Value entity:\n\t* Increase: No, \"increase\" is not a Property Value entity because it is a general term that describes a change in quantity, rather than a specific value.\n\t* Thienyl spacers: No, \"thienyl spacers\" is not a Property Value entity because it is a type of molecule, rather than a specific value.\n\t* EQE response wavelengths: Yes, \"EQE response wavelengths\" is a Property Value entity because it refers to a specific range of wavelengths that are related to the efficiency of a device.\n\t* Peak values: Yes, \"peak values\" is a Property Value entity because it refers to the highest or most significant value of a particular property.\n\t* PDTP-DT2BT: No, \"PDTP-DT2BT\" is not a Property Value entity because it is a specific type of molecule, rather than a value.\n\t* PDTP-BT: No, \"PDTP-BT\" is not a Property Value entity because it is a specific type of molecule, rather than a value.\n\t* PDTP-DTBT: No, \"PDTP-DTBT\" is not a Property Value entity because it is a specific type of molecule, rather than a value.\n3.
