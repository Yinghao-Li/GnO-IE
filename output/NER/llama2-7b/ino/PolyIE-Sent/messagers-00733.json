Identify the adjectives in the paragraph:\n\t* multiple\n\t* common\n3. Identify the verbs in the paragraph:\n\t* exhibited\n\t* based\n4. Identify the adverbs in the paragraph:\n\t* randomly\n5. Identify the pronouns in the paragraph:\n\t* it\n\nNow, let's check which of these words can be classified as \"Property Value\" entities:\n\n* \"Multiple\" and \"common\" can be classified as Property Value entities because they describe the number or frequency of a particular property or characteristic of the random terpolymers.\n* \"Absorption bands\" is a Property Value entity because it refers to a specific range of wavelengths that the terpolymers absorb.\n* \"Donor units\" and \"acceptor units\" are not Property Value entities because they are not specific properties or characteristics of the terpolymers. They are instead types of building blocks or components that are used to create the terpolymers.\n\nTherefore, the Property Value entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* Multiple\n* Common\n* Absorption bands"
