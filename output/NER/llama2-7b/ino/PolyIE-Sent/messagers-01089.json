EQE (Efficiency Quotient Evaluation) curve\n2. solar irradiation spectrum\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. EQE curve: The term \"EQE curve\" refers to a graphical representation of the efficiency of a solar cell or panel as a function of the solar irradiance. It is a key parameter in the analysis of solar cell performance. Therefore, \"EQE curve\" can be considered a material name entity.\n2. solar irradiation spectrum: The term \"solar irradiation spectrum\" refers to the distribution of solar radiation in terms of wavelength or energy. It is a measure of the amount of solar energy available at a particular location and time. Since the term \"solar irradiation spectrum\" refers to a specific material (i.e., solar radiation), it can also be considered a material name entity."
