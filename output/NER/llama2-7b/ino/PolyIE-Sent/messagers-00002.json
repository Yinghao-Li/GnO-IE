Aggregation: This is a general term that refers to the act of collecting or grouping things together. In the context of the paragraph, it is likely referring to the aggregation of particles or molecules in a material.\n2. Spectral broadening: This term refers to the process of spreading out the absorption or emission spectrum of a material. In the paragraph, it is likely referring to the broadening of the absorption spectrum of the material due to the aggregation of particles or molecules.\n3. Thin films: This term refers to a layer of material that is only a few nanometers thick. In the paragraph, it is likely referring to the thin films of material that were studied for their optical properties.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
