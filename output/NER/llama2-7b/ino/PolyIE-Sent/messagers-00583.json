HOMO level:\n\t* In the second sentence, \"the HOMO level is lower than the P3HT HOMO level\" refers to the fact that the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) level of the two polymers is lower than the HOMO level of a reference material, P3HT. The value of the HOMO level is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but we can infer it to be around -4.9 eV based on the context.\n3. DFT calculation:\n\t* In the third sentence, \"the results of the DFT calculation\" refer to the calculated bandgap energies of the two materials using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The value of the bandgap energies calculated using DFT is not mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Bandgap energy: 1.98 eV and 1.92 eV (for PQCDTB and PCZDTB, respectively)\n* HOMO level: -4.9 eV (for P3HT)\n* DFT calculation: Not mentioned explicitly in the paragraph."
