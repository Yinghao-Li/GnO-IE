PzNDTTPD - This is a polymer with \"Pz\" as the prefix, indicating that it is a polymer of some unknown material. The rest of the name, \"NDTTPD\", is likely a specific name or abbreviation for this material.\n2. PC71BM - This is a chemical compound with the prefix \"PC\", indicating that it is a polymer of some unknown material. The rest of the name, \"71BM\", is likely a specific name or abbreviation for this material.\n3. NDT - This is likely a specific name or abbreviation for a material, as it appears in the context of comparing it to \"PzNDTTPD\".\n4. TPD - This is likely a specific name or abbreviation for a material, as it appears in the context of comparing it to \"PzNDTTPD\".\n5. PNDTTPD - This is a polymer with \"PND\" as the prefix, indicating that it is a polymer of some unknown material. The rest of the name, \"TTPD\", is likely a specific name or abbreviation for this material.\n6. PCE - This is an abbreviation for \"power conversion efficiency\", which is a measure of the efficiency of a solar cell or other energy conversion device.\n7. V oc - This is an abbreviation for \"open circuit voltage\", which is a measure of the maximum voltage that a solar cell can achieve under ideal conditions.\n8. hole mobility - This is a measure of the mobility of holes in a semiconductor material, which is a measure of how easily holes can move through the material.\n9. on / off current ratio - This is a measure of the ratio of the current that flows through a transistor when it is turned on to the current that flows through it when it is turned off.\n\nI hope this helps!
