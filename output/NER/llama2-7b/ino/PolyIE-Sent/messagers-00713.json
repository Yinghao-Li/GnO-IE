Low-bandgap polymers: This is a property of the polymers, which refers to the energy gap of the polymer, which is the energy difference between the valence and conduction bands of the material. In this context, \"low-bandgap\" means that the energy gap is relatively small, which can lead to limited absorption of light.\n2. Donor (D): This is a property of the polymer, which refers to the molecular structure that donates electrons during the photoexcitation process. In the context of the paragraph, the donor is the molecule that donates electrons to the acceptor.\n3. Acceptor (A): This is also a property of the polymer, which refers to the molecular structure that accepts electrons during the photoexcitation process. In the context of the paragraph, the acceptor is the molecule that accepts electrons from the donor.\n\nTherefore, the Property Name entities in the paragraph are \"Low-bandgap polymers\", \"Donor\", and \"Acceptor\"."

Low-band-gap polymers: This is a property of the polymers, which refers to the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands of the material. A lower band gap indicates a higher energy gap, which can result in a lower absorption efficiency.\n2. Broad absorption: This is a property of the polymers, which refers to the range of wavelengths that the material can absorb. Broad absorption refers to the ability of the material to absorb a wide range of wavelengths, while narrow absorption refers to the ability of the material to absorb only a limited range of wavelengths.\n3. Absorption maxima: This is a property of the polymers, which refers to the specific wavelengths at which the material absorbs light. The absorption maxima are the wavelengths at which the material absorbs the most light.\n4. Visible region: This is a property of the material, which refers to the range of wavelengths that can be seen by the human eye. The visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum includes wavelengths between approximately 400 and 700 nanometers.\n5. Photocurrent: This is a property of the material, which refers to the flow of electric current generated by the material in response to light. The photocurrent is generated when light is absorbed by the material and excites electrons, which can then be harnessed to generate electricity.\n\nIn summary, the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Low-band-gap polymers\n2. Broad absorption\n3. Absorption maxima\n4. Visible region\n5. Photocurrent"
