Molecular ordering: This is a property of the material that refers to the degree of organization of the molecules in the thin films. XRD studies can be used to measure the degree of molecular ordering in the films.\n2. Hole mobility: This is a property of the material that refers to the ability of holes (positive charge carriers) to move through the material. The hole mobility is related to the electrical conductivity of the material and can be affected by factors such as temperature, doping, and defects.\n\nIn this paragraph, the authors are discussing how the annealing of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO thin films affects their property values, specifically the molecular ordering and hole mobility."
