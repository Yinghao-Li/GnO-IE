On / off current ratio\n3. 10^6 - 10^7\n4. 10^3 - 10^4\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"High current modulation\" is a property value that describes the ability of a material to modulate (or control) the current flowing through it. In this context, it means that the material can change the amount of current flowing through it in response to some external stimulus.\n2. \"On / off current ratio\" is another property value that describes the ability of a material to switch between two states (on and off) based on some external stimulus. In this context, it means that the material can change its current flowing through it in response to some external stimulus, and the ratio of the current flowing through it in the on state to the current flowing through it in the off state.\n3. \"10^6 - 10^7\" is a range of values that represents the current modulation observed in PzNDTBTBO. It means that the current flowing through PzNDTBTBO can be modulated between 10^6 and 10^7 times the initial current flowing through it.\n4. \"10^3 - 10^4\" is a range of values that represents the on / off current ratio observed in PzNDDTDBT. It means that the current flowing through PzNDDTDBT can be switched between 10^3 and 10^4 times the initial current flowing through it in response to some external stimulus.\n\nIn summary, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are \"High current modulation\", \"On / off current ratio\", \"10^6 - 10^7\", and \"10^3 - 10^4\"."
