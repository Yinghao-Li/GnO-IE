Thin films: The phrase \"thin films\" is a material name, as it refers to a specific type of material with a particular composition or structure.\n3. Optical band gap: The phrase \"optical band gap\" is a material property, which is a range of wavelengths of light that a material can absorb or transmit. In this case, the paragraph is mentioning the narrow optical band gap of the polymer thin films, which is a material property."
