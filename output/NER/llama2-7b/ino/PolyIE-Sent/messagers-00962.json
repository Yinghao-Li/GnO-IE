Its property value is related to its ability to donate electrons in the polymer solar cell.\n2. \"diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)\" - Another type of organic compound, diketopyrrolopyrrole is used as an electron-withdrawing unit in the copolymer. Its property value is related to its ability to withdraw electrons from the polymer, which can enhance the overall performance of the solar cell.\n3. \"polymer solar cells\" - This is the entity that combines the properties of the two organic compounds (TA and DPP) to create a functional material with desirable properties for solar cell applications. The property value of the polymer solar cell is related to its ability to convert light into electrical energy.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* 9,10-thienyl-substituted anthracene (TA)\n* diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)\n* polymer solar cells"
