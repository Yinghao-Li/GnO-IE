Optimization: This refers to the lack of optimization of the device, meaning that it has not been optimized for maximum performance.\n3. Material: This refers to the material used to make the device, which is not specified in the paragraph.\n4. AM 1.5: This refers to the solar simulator used to simulate the solar light used in the experiment. AM 1.5 is a standardized solar simulator that emulates the spectral irradiance of sunlight.\n5. Solar light: This refers to the light used in the experiment, which is simulated using the AM 1.5 solar simulator.\n6. Power conversion efficiency (PCE): This refers to the efficiency of the device in converting sunlight into electrical energy, which is measured as a percentage."
