Spirobifluorene - This is the name of the conjugated polymer that is being studied in the paragraph.\n2. Polymer - This is a general term for a large molecule composed of many repeating units, and in this context, it refers to the conjugated polymer made up of spirobifluorene units.\n3. Main chain - This term refers to the backbone of the conjugated polymer, which is the sequence of spirobifluorene units that are linked together.\n4. Donor - This term refers to the electron-donating unit in the conjugated polymer, which is the spirobifluorene moiety in this case.\n5. Acceptor - This term refers to the electron-accepting unit in the conjugated polymer, which is the unit that accepts the electrons from the donor unit.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
