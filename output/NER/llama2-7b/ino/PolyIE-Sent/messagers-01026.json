In this context, the property value is being compared between PTATDPP and PTAFDPP.\n2. \"microstructures\" is a property of a material that refers to the small-scale structure of the material, including the arrangement of atoms, molecules, or other components. In this context, the property value is being used to describe the closely packed microstructures of PTATDPP, which are believed to contribute to its high charge-carrier mobility."
