Fluorene, anthracene, and pyrene are all molecules with flat structures. These structures are mentioned in the paragraph as examples of molecules that have been reported to form excimers or aggregates through strong interchain π-π interactions.\n2. Interchain π-π interactions are a property value that describes the strength of the interactions between the flat molecules. These interactions are strong and are responsible for the formation of excimers or aggregates.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* Fluorene\n* Anthracene\n* Pyrene\n* Interchain π-π interactions"
