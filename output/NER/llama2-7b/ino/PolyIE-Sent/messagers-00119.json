PffBB-14: This is a material name that consists of a combination of letters and numbers. It is likely a unique identifier for a specific material, rather than a common name.\n2. PC71BM: This is a common name for a material, which is often used in the field of organic photovoltaics. It is a polymer material that is commonly used as a hole-transporting material in organic solar cells."
