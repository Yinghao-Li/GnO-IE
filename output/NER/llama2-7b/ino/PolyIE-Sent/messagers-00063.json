Optical band gap\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Planarity effect: This refers to the effect of the molecular structure on the optical properties of the material, specifically the way the molecules are arranged in a flat, two-dimensional layer.\n2. Interchain stacking: This refers to the arrangement of the molecules in a stacked, layer-by-layer structure, where the molecules are stacked on top of each other.\n3. Bathochromic shift: This refers to a shift of the absorption edge of the material towards longer wavelengths, resulting in a higher energy gap.\n4. Absorption cut-off: This refers to the wavelength at which the material absorbs light, beyond which the material does not absorb any light.\n5. Optical band gap: This refers to the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in a material, which determines the material's ability to conduct electricity."
