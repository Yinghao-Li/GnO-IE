Jsc (Current density)\n5. FF (Fill factor)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Jsc: The paragraph mentions that the Jsc of PIDT-C12NT based device was higher than that of the other two polymers. Jsc refers to the current density (in Amperes per square centimeter) of the photoactive layer.\n2. FF: The paragraph also mentions that the FF of PIDT-C12NT based device was higher than that of the other two polymers. FF refers to the fill factor (a dimensionless quantity) of the photoactive layer, which represents the ratio of the active area of the solar cell to the total area of the photoactive layer.\n3. PIDT-C12NT: This is the name of the polymer used in the device.\n4. Jsc: As mentioned earlier, Jsc is the current density of the photoactive layer.\n5. FF: As mentioned earlier, FF is the fill factor of the photoactive layer."
