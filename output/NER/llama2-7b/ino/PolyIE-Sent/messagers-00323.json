Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Polymer backbone: This is a general term used to describe the chain-like structure of a polymer. In this context, it refers to the main chain of the polymer that is involved in the absorption process.\n2. π-π* transitions: These are transitions that occur between two pi-orbitals (π-orbitals) of the polymer backbone. In the context of absorption spectroscopy, these transitions are associated with the absorption of light by the polymer.\n3. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT): This refers to the transfer of electrons between different parts of the same molecule. In the context of the paragraph, it is suggested that the lower-energy peak in the absorption spectrum is due to ICT in the electron-rich and electron-deficient units of the polymer."
