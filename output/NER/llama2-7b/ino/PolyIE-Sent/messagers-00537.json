Conjugated polymers: The paragraph specifically mentions \"conjugated polymers\" as the material that needs to meet certain conditions to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE). This suggests that \"conjugated polymers\" is a material name.\n2. Polymers: While the paragraph does not specifically mention \"polymers\" as a material name, it does use the term \"polymers\" in the context of \"conjugated polymers,\" which suggests that \"polymers\" is a broader category that includes \"conjugated polymers.\"\n3. Fullerene: The paragraph mentions \"fullerene\" as a material that is involved in effective electron charge transfer to \"conjugated polymers.\" This suggests that \"fullerene\" is a material name.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
