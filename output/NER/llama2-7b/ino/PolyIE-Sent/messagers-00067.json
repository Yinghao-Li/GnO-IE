LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital)\n3. π-conjugation framework (a structural feature of the molecule)\n4. benzothiadiazole (a specific molecular unit)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. HOMO: The term \"HOMO\" refers to the hybrid orbital molecular orbital, which is a type of molecular orbital that is formed by the overlap of atomic orbitals in a molecule. In this context, the HOMO is delocalized over the π-conjugation framework, meaning that it is distributed evenly throughout the molecule.\n2. LUMO: The term \"LUMO\" refers to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, which is the lowest energy molecular orbital that is not occupied by an electron. In this context, the LUMO is mainly populated on the benzothiadiazole article unit, meaning that it is more concentrated on this specific part of the molecule.\n3. π-conjugation framework: The term \"π-conjugation framework\" refers to the arrangement of pi (π) electrons in a molecule. In this context, the π-conjugation framework is the structure of the molecule that allows for the delocalization of the HOMO over the molecule.\n4. benzothiadiazole: Benzothiadiazole is a specific molecular unit that is present in the molecule. It is not a property name entity, but rather a specific molecular structure.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* HOMO\n* LUMO\n\nThe other terms in the paragraph (π-conjugation framework and benzothiadiazole) are not \"Property Name\" entities, but rather structural or descriptive terms that provide additional information about the molecule."
