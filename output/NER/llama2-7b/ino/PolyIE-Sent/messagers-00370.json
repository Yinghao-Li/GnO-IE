PC71BM\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Mobility: This refers to the ability of charge carriers (electrons or holes) to move within the material or device. In the context of the paragraph, higher mobility is expected to favor charge transport in the blend film, leading to better solar cell performance.\n2. Charge transport: This refers to the movement of charge carriers (electrons or holes) through a material or device. In the paragraph, charge transport is mentioned as a property that will be improved by the thermal alignment of the materials.\n3. Solar cell performance: This refers to the overall efficiency or effectiveness of a solar cell in converting sunlight into electrical energy. The paragraph suggests that the improved charge transport in the blend film will lead to better solar cell performance.\n4. Thermal alignment: This refers to the process of aligning the crystal structure of materials in a specific direction to optimize their properties. In the paragraph, thermal alignment is mentioned as a way to improve charge transport in the blend film.\n5. PCDSeBT: This is a specific material mentioned in the paragraph, which is likely a type of organic semiconductor.\n6. PC71BM: This is another specific material mentioned in the paragraph, which is likely another type of organic semiconductor.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mobility\n2. Charge transport\n3. Solar cell performance\n4. Thermal alignment\n5. PCDSeBT\n6. PC71BM"

Mobility: This refers to the ability of charge carriers (electrons or holes) to move within the material. A higher mobility means that the charge carriers can move more easily through the material, which can improve the efficiency of the solar cell.\n2. Charge transport: This refers to the ability of the material to transport charge carriers from one place to another. In the context of solar cells, this means the ability of the material to move charge carriers from the light-absorbing layer to the electrodes. A more balanced charge transport means that the charge carriers can move more easily and efficiently through the material.\n3. Solar cell performance: This refers to the overall efficiency of the solar cell in converting light into electrical energy. A high solar cell performance means that the solar cell is able to convert a high percentage of the incoming light into electrical energy, which can be used to power electrical devices.\n\nThese entities are identified as \"Property Value\" entities because they are properties or characteristics of the material being described, rather than the material itself. In other words, they are the values or qualities that the material possesses, such as its ability to transport charge carriers or its efficiency in converting light into electrical energy."
