HOMO and LUMO are energy levels of the polymers, which are properties of the molecules being studied. These energy levels are determined by the electronic structure of the polymers and are measured using CV measurements.\n2. CV measurements are a technique used to measure the electronic properties of molecules, including the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The measurements involve cycling the potential of the molecule between a positive and negative voltage, and the resulting current is used to determine the energy levels of the molecule.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, the entities \"HOMO\" and \"LUMO\" are property values, while \"CV measurements\" is a technique used to measure those properties."
