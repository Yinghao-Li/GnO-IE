Morphologies: The term \"morphologies\" refers to the overall shape or structure of something, in this case, the active films. It can be considered a property name because it describes a characteristic of the films that is being studied.\n2. J sc: \"Jsc\" is an abbreviation for \"short-circuit current\", which is a measure of the current that flows through a photovoltaic device when it is connected in a short-circuit configuration. In the context of the paragraph, the author is suggesting that the morphologies of the active films do not affect the Jsc of the photovoltaic devices."
