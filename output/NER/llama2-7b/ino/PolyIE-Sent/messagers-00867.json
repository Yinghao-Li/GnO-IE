In this context, thermal annealing is the process that is being referred to.\n2. Hole mobility: This refers to the ability of holes (electrons) to move through a material. In the context of the paragraph, the hole mobility of both copolymers is increased after thermal annealing, which means that the material becomes more conductive.\n3. Crystallinity: This refers to the degree of crystallinity of a material, which is a measure of how much the material's molecules are arranged in a crystalline structure. In the context of the paragraph, the crystallinity of the polymer films is improved after thermal annealing.\n4. π-π closepacking: This refers to a type of arrangement of molecules in which the pi (π) electrons of adjacent molecules are aligned closely together, creating a stacked structure.
