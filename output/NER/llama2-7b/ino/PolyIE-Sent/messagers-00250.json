HOMO and LUMO are chemical concepts used to describe the molecular orbitals of a molecule. They are used to describe the energy levels of electrons in a molecule and their distribution around the nucleus.\n2. alkoxy is a suffix that denotes an alkyl group (a group of atoms consisting of a carbon atom and one or more hydrogen atoms) with an oxygen atom attached.\n3. alkyl is a suffix that denotes an alkyl group.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are HOMO, LUMO, alkoxy, and alkyl."
