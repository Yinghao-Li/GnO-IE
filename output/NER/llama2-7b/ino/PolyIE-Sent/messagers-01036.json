In this context, the compatibility of PTATDPP and di-PBI is being examined.\n2. \"Photoluminescence (PL) quenching\" is a property that refers to the reduction or suppression of the photoluminescence of a material, often due to the interaction with another material. In this context, the PL quenching of each compound in the blend film is being examined.\n3. \"Blend film\" is a property that refers to a film or layer composed of two or more materials mixed together. In this context, the blend film refers to the material that is being examined for compatibility and PL quenching.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
