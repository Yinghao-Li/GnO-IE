Drain current: The paragraph mentions \"good drain-current modulation,\" which refers to the ability of the device to control or modify the drain current. Therefore, \"drain current\" is a property value entity.\n2. Linear region: The paragraph states that the device shows \"well-defined linear regions,\" which implies that the device has a linear relationship between the drain current and the gate voltage. Therefore, \"linear region\" is a property value entity.\n3. Saturation region: The paragraph mentions \"saturation regions,\" which refers to the region where the drain current is maximum and does not change significantly with further increases in the gate voltage. Therefore, \"saturation region\" is a property value entity."
