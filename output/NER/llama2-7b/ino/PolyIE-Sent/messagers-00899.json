Band gaps\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Photovoltaic performances: This is a property value that is being compared between the NT-based and BT-based polymers. The paragraph mentions that the NT-based polymers exhibited improved photovoltaic performances relative to the BT counterparts, indicating that the former have better ability to convert light into electrical energy.\n2. Carrier mobility: This is another property value that is being compared between the two types of polymers. The paragraph mentions that the carrier mobility of the NT-based polymers is higher than that of the BT counterparts, which means that the former can transport charge carriers more efficiently.\n3. Band gaps: This is a property value that is being discussed in the context of the improved photovoltaic performances. The paragraph explains that the reduced band gaps of the NT-based polymers contribute to their enhanced carrier mobility and photovoltaic performances. In this context, \"band gap\" refers to the energy difference between the valence and conduction bands of a material, which determines the material's ability to absorb and convert light into electrical energy."
