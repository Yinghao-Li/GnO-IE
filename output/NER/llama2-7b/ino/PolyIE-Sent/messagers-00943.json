FF (Fill Factor)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Charge transport: This is a general term that refers to the movement of charge carriers (electrons or holes) in a material. In the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned that film morphology plays a critical role in charge transport.\n2. Morphology: This refers to the structure or shape of the material, particularly in the context of thin films. In the paragraph, the smoother blend film based on PIDT-C12NT is described as having more favorable morphological features.\n3. PIDT-C12NT: This is a specific material or polymer mentioned in the paragraph.\n4. Jsc (Jsc): Jsc stands for \"short-circuit current\" and refers to the maximum current that a solar cell can produce when it is short-circuited. In the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned that the smoother blend film based on PIDT-C12NT may lead to higher Jsc than the other two polymers.\n5. FF (Fill Factor): FF stands for \"fill factor\" and refers to the ratio of the active area of a solar cell to its total area. In the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned that the smoother blend film based on PIDT-C12NT may lead to higher FF than the other two polymers."
