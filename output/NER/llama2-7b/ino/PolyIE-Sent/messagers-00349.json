Thermal annealing: This is a process of heating and cooling a material to alter its properties, and it is mentioned in the paragraph as the process that causes the peaks to progressively intensify.\n2. Primary peak: This refers to the first peak observed in the thermal annealing process, which corresponds to a d-spacing of 19.99 Å.\n3. Secondary peak: This refers to the second peak observed in the thermal annealing process, which corresponds to a d-spacing of 4.21 Å.\n4. d-spacing: This is a measure of the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattice, and it is mentioned in the paragraph as the distance between the atoms in the primary and secondary peaks.\n5. π-π stacking: This is a type of stacking arrangement in which the molecules or layers are aligned in a parallel or stacked configuration, and it is mentioned in the paragraph as the possible relationship of the secondary peak to π-π stacking."
