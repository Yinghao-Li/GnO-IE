Charge carrier mobility\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Sunlight harvesting efficiency: This refers to the ability of organic semiconducting materials to convert sunlight into electrical energy. It is a measure of how much sunlight is converted into electrical energy, and it is an important property value in the context of PSCs (perovskite solar cells) as they rely on sunlight as an energy source.\n2. Charge carrier mobility: This refers to the ability of charge carriers (electrons or holes) to move within the material. In the context of organic semiconducting materials, charge carrier mobility is an important property value as it determines how quickly charge can be transported within the material, which in turn affects the overall performance of PSCs."
