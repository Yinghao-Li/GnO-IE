The term \"ter-\" indicates that the polymer has three repeating units.\n2. Perylene units: These are the individual repeating units that make up the ter-polymers. Perylene is a type of aromatic molecule that contains multiple fused benzene rings.\n3. Suzuki coupling: This is a chemical reaction used in the synthesis of the ter-polymers. It involves the coupling of two organic molecules using a metal catalyst, in this case, Suzuki coupling polymerization.\n\nIn summary, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are the types of polymers (ter-polymers) and the individual repeating units (perylene units) that make them up, as well as the reaction method used to synthesize them (Suzuki coupling)."
