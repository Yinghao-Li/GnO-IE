Coplanar structure\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"Decent hole mobilities\" is a property name used to describe the ability of a material to transport holes (electrons) efficiently. In this context, the authors are suggesting that the high crystallinity of the copolymers leads to decent hole mobilities.\n2. \"Crystallinity\" is a property name used to describe the degree of crystallinity of a material. In this context, the authors are suggesting that the copolymers have high crystallinity due to the highly coplanar structure of anthracene and DPP.\n3. \"Coplanar structure\" is a property name used to describe the arrangement of molecules in a material. In this context, the authors are suggesting that the anthracene and DPP molecules have a highly coplanar structure, which leads to high crystallinity and decent hole mobilities in the copolymers."
