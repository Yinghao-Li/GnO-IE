Optical bandgap: This is a property of the polymer, which refers to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the material. The optical bandgap is an important property of materials, as it determines the material's ability to absorb and transmit light.\n2. Quinoid character: This is another property of the polymer, which refers to the degree to which the polymer backbone adopts a quinoid structure. A quinoid structure is a type of conjugated structure in which the double bonds are located in a particular arrangement, resulting in a particular optical and electronic properties. The quinoid character of a material can affect its optical properties, such as the optical bandgap.\n3. Reduction of the optical bandgap: This is a property value that is observed in the replacement of thiophene with selenophene in the polymer backbone. The reduction of the optical bandgap indicates that the material becomes more conductive to light, which can have important applications in electronic devices.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Property Value\" entities identified in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Optical bandgap\n2. Quinoid character\n3. Reduction of the optical bandgap"
