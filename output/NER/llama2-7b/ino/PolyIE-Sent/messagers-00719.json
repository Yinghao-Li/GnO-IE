It is a type of copolymer consisting of multiple repeating units.\n2. Unit 1:\n\t* \"one electron - rich unit\"\n\tThis refers to the first repeating unit in the copolymer, which is rich in electrons.\n3. Unit 2:\n\t* \"thienylsubstituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDTT )\"\n\tThis is the second repeating unit in the copolymer, which is a thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene.\n4. Unit 3:\n\t* \"two electron - deficient units\"\n\tThis refers to the remaining two repeating units in the copolymer, which are electron-deficient.\n5. Unit 4:\n\t* \"DPP\"\n\tThis stands for \"Dithienyl-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione\".\n6. Unit 5:\n\t* \"TPD\"\n\tThis stands for \"Thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione\".\n\nSo, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"poly[thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione]\"\n\nI hope this helps!
