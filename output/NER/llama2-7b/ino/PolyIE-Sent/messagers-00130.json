Conjugated polymer: A conjugated polymer is a type of polymer that has a repeating structure with alternating double and single bonds, which gives it electronic conjugation. This property allows the polymer to absorb light and transport electrons efficiently, making it useful for photovoltaic applications.\n2. Fullerene derivative: A fullerene derivative is a type of molecule that is derived from the molecule fullerene (C60). Fullerenes have a unique structure in which 12 pentagonal rings are fused together to form a spherical molecule. Fullerene derivatives are molecules that are derived from fullerenes by modifying their structure in some way, such as adding or removing atoms or groups of atoms. In the context of the paragraph, the fullerene derivative is likely a derivative of a fullerene molecule that is used in the BHJ system."
