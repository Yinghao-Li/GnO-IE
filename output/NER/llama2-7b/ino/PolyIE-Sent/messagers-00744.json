It is a physical property of the material, which is a measure of the energy required to bind an exciton (a quasiparticle that arises from the interaction of an electron and a hole in an organic material) in the material.\n2. \"E g OPT\" refers to the exciton binding energy of the organic conjugated materials. It is a synonym for \"E g CV\" and means the same thing."
