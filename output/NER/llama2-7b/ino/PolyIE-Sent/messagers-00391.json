Polymers: The term \"polymers\" refers to a class of materials composed of repeating structural units, which are typically synthesized through polymerization reactions. In the context of organic photovoltaic devices, polymers are used as the building blocks for the active layer of the device.\n2. Donor polymers: The term \"donor polymers\" specifically refers to a type of polymer that has a low band gap energy, which is important for charge transportation in organic photovoltaic devices. Donor polymers are typically used as the electron donor material in the device, where they donate electrons to the electron acceptor material."
