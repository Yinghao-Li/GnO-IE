Copolymers: The term \"copolymers\" refers to a type of polymer that is made up of two or more different monomers. In this context, the copolymers are the materials from which the solar cell devices are fabricated.\n2. PC71BM: PC71BM is a specific type of material used in the fabrication of solar cells. It is likely a type of organic material or compound.\n3. PTATDPP: PTATDPP is a specific type of copolymer used in the fabrication of solar cells. The term \"PT\" likely stands for \"polythiophene,\" which is a type of organic material commonly used in organic solar cells.\n4. PTAFDPP: PTAFDPP is another specific type of copolymer used in the fabrication of solar cells. Again, the term \"PT\" likely stands for \"polythiophene,\" and \"AFDPP\" is likely a specific type of polymer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Copolymers\n* PC71BM\n* PTATDPP\n* PTAFDPP"
