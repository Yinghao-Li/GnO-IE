Let's go through the entities in the paragraph one by one:\n\n1. \"33 Random terpolymers\" - This is the name of the type of polymers being discussed in the paragraph.\n2. \"thieno[2′,3′ : 5′,6′]pyrido [ 3,4- g]\" - This is a chemical structure, specifically a type of terpolymer. The \"thieno\" part refers to a specific type of molecule, and the numbers in parentheses indicate the position of the atoms in the molecule.\n3. \"thiophene( T )\" - This is another chemical structure, specifically a type of terpolymer. The \"thiophene\" part refers to a specific type of molecule, and the \"T\" is likely a variable that represents a specific atom or group of atoms in the molecule.\n4. \"dithiophene ( 2T )\" - This is another chemical structure, specifically a type of terpolymer. The \"dithiophene\" part refers to a specific type of molecule, and the \"2T\" likely represents the same atom or group of atoms as the \"T\" in the previous entity.\n5. \"Yang and co-workers\" - This is a group of researchers who synthesized the terpolymers mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nI hope that helps!
