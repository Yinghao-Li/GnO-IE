Hole mobilities: The term \"hole mobilities\" refers to the mobility of holes in a material, which is a measure of how easily holes can move through the material. In this context, the sentence is comparing the hole mobilities of BT-or BO-based polymers, indicating that these polymers have high hole mobilities.\n2. Highest values: The phrase \"highest values\" refers to the highest values of hole mobilities that have been observed for BT-or BO-based polymers. This indicates that these polymers have exceptionally high hole mobilities compared to other materials."
