Blend films: The term \"blend films\" refers to a type of material or substance that is made by combining two or more different materials. In this context, the paragraph is comparing the smoothness of different blend films.\n2. Films: The term \"films\" is a general term that can refer to a variety of materials, including plastic films, metal films, and other types of thin layers. In this context, \"films\" is likely used to refer to the blend films being compared for smoothness."
