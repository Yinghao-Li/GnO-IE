      "content": "In the given paragraph, the \"Property Value\" entities can be identified as follows:\n\n1. Property: Property Value\n2. Property: NDTn isomers\n3. Property: polymer semiconductor materials\n4. Property: OFET performance\n5. Property: mobility\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"Property: Property Value\" - This is a general term that refers to any property or value that can be associated with an entity, such as a material, compound, or structure.\n2. \"Property: NDTn isomers\" - In this context, \"NDTn\" refers to a specific type of isomer, which is a molecule with the same molecular formula but a different arrangement of atoms in space. The \"Property: NDTn isomers\" refers to the different isomers of NDTn that were reported by Takimiya and co-workers.\n3. \"Property: polymer semiconductor materials\" - This refers to the type of material that is being studied or used in the context of the research. Polymer semiconductor materials are a class of materials that are made up of polymers, which are long chains of repeating molecules, and have semiconductor properties.\n4. \"Property: OFET performance\" - OFET stands for organic field-effect transistor, which is a type of transistor that is made up of organic materials. \"OFET performance\" refers to the performance of the transistor, which can include parameters such as the mobility of charge carriers (electrons or holes) and the threshold voltage.\n5. \"Property: mobility\" - Mobility refers to the ability of charge carriers (electrons or holes) to move through a material. In the context of OFETs, mobility is an important parameter that determines the performance of the transistor. A higher mobility means that the charge carriers can move more easily through the material, which can result in better transistor performance."

This is a material property that can affect the performance of the transistor."
