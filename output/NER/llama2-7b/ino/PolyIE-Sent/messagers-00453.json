Copolymers: The paragraph mentions the synthesis of copolymers, which are materials composed of two or more different monomers. Therefore, \"copolymers\" can be identified as a Material Name entity.\n2. Perylene: The paragraph mentions the addition of perylene to the copolymers, which is a specific material. Therefore, \"perylene\" can be identified as a Material Name entity."
