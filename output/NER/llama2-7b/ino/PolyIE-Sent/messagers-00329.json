PCDSeBT - This is a material name, as it is a combination of \"PCD\" and \"BT\", which are likely to be the names of two materials.\n2. PDCTBT - This is also a material name, as it is a combination of \"PDCT\" and \"BT\", which are likely to be the names of two materials.\n3. Se°°°Se - This is a chemical formula, not a material name.
