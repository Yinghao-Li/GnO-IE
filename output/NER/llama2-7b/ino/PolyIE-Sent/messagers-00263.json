It is a key indicator of economic activity and is used to calculate the personal savings rate.\n2. POBDTPD (Personal Outlays on Bought Durable Goods): This refers to the amount of money spent by households on durable goods, such as cars, appliances, and furniture.\n3. PEBDTPD (Personal Outlays on Bought Durable Goods for the Producer Price Deflator): This is a measure of the amount of money spent by households on durable goods, adjusted for inflation. It is used to calculate the producer price index, which measures the rate of inflation for goods and services produced by businesses.\n\nTherefore, the three entities identified as \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are PCEs, POBDTPD, and PEBDTPD."
