Band gap: The paragraph mentions that the TA unit is a promising electron-donating unit for low band-gap copolymers, indicating that the band gap of the copolymers is low. Band gap is a property of a material that refers to the energy difference between the valence and conduction bands of a solid, and it is an important parameter in determining the electrical and optical properties of a material.\n2. HOMO energy level: The paragraph mentions that the HOMO energy level of the TA unit is low, which means that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the TA unit is low. The HOMO energy level is an important property of a material that determines the electron affinity and ionization energy of the material."
