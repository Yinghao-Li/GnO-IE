Polymers: The term \"polymers\" refers to a class of materials composed of repeating structural units, often made up of monomers linked together through covalent bonds. In the context of the paragraph, polymers are the materials that can be minimized through the structural feature being discussed.\n2. Spiro-annulated molecules: A \"spiro-annulated molecule\" refers to a type of molecule that contains a ring structure with a single bond between two carbon atoms, which is also bonded to a nitrogen or oxygen atom. In the context of the paragraph, spiro-annulated molecules are the specific type of molecules that can be minimized through the structural feature being discussed."
