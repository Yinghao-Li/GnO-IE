It is a combination of three words: \"PBDT,\" \"TDPP,\" and \"-S.\"\n* \"PBDT\" and \"TDPP\" are likely abbreviations for chemical compounds or materials, and \"-S\" is likely a suffix indicating the chemical formula or structure of the material.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entity in the paragraph is \"PBDT-TDPP-S.\""
