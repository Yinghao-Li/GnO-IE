Absorption Spectra: The range of red-shifts (56-68 nm) of the absorption maxima in the solid films.\n2. Absorption Maxima: The absorption maxima of the conjugated polymers in the solid films, which are similar to those in solution.\n\nNote that the term \"Property Value\" is used to refer to the specific value or range of values associated with a particular property or characteristic of an entity. In this case, the property value entities are the ranges of red-shifts and absorption maxima of the conjugated polymers in the solid films."
