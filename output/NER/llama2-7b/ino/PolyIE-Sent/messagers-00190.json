Donor: The term \"donor\" is used to describe the material that donates electrons during the electrochemical reaction. In this context, the donor is likely a material used in the blend films.\n2. Acceptor: The term \"acceptor\" is used to describe the material that accepts electrons during the electrochemical reaction. In this context, the acceptor is likely a material used in the blend films.\n3. Blend films: The term \"blend films\" refers to a material made by combining two or more different materials. In this context, the blend films are likely made of a combination of materials used in the devices.\n4. Cathode metal: The term \"cathode metal\" refers to the metal used as the electrode in an electrochemical cell where electrons flow out. In this context, the cathode metal is likely a material used in the devices.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* Donor\n* Acceptor\n* Blend films\n* Cathode metal"
