This implies that these entities have a property related to their peak positions, which are the positions of the maximum absorption of the molecules.\n2. Edge positions: The paragraph also mentions that the edge positions of PFDTBT, PFDTBT_5Per, and PFDTBT_10Per are almost equivalent. Edge positions refer to the positions of the edges of the molecules, which can affect their absorption properties.\n3. Maximum absorption peak wavelength: The paragraph states that the maximum absorption peak for PFDTBT_20Per moved to a shorter wavelength region. This implies that the maximum absorption peak of PFDTBT_20Per has a specific wavelength, which is a property of the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the three entities that can be identified as \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are peak positions, edge positions, and maximum absorption peak wavelength."
