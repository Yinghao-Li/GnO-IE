It is a property of the material that can be measured experimentally.\n2. \"HOMO energy levels\" refers to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the polymers. HOMO energy levels are a measure of the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbitals in a material, which can be influenced by the introduction of perylene units."
