Polymer\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"Alkyl side chain\" refers to a specific type of molecular structure that is commonly found in organic molecules. Alkyl side chains are typically long, hydrophobic (water-repelling) chains that are attached to a larger molecule, such as a polymer.\n2. \"Polymer\" is a broader term that refers to a large molecule composed of many smaller molecules bonded together. In the context of the paragraph, the polymer is the material that the alkyl side chains are attached to."
