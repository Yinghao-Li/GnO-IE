Polymers\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"Alkyl side chains\" - In this context, \"alkyl side chains\" refer to the specific type of molecules or groups that are attached to the polymer backbone. These side chains can have different sizes, as mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, \"alkyl side chains\" can be considered a material name entity.\n2. \"Polymers\" - The term \"polymers\" refers to a class of materials that are composed of repeating structural units, often made up of monomers. In this paragraph, the text specifically mentions \"polymers with the same backbone,\" which suggests that the term \"polymers\" is being used to refer to a specific type of material. Therefore, \"polymers\" can also be considered a material name entity."
