TPD (Polymer Name):\n\t* TPD is mentioned as a material that can be controlled to change its optical properties by tuning its ratio with DPP.\n\t* TPD is associated with increased absorption between 400 and 650 nm and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level.\n3. Terpolymers (Material Name):\n\t* The paragraph refers to \"random terpolymers\" which suggests that terpolymers are a class of materials being studied.\n\t* Terpolymers are composed of three monomers (DPP, TPD, and an unknown third monomer) that are randomly combined.\n4. Unknown Monomer (Material Name):\n\t* The paragraph mentions that the optical properties of terpolymers can be controlled by tuning the ratio between DPP and TPD.\n\t* The unknown monomer is the third monomer that is combined with DPP and TPD to form terpolymers.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* DPP (Polymer Name)\n* TPD (Polymer Name)\n* Terpolymers (Material Name)\n* Unknown Monomer (Material Name)"
