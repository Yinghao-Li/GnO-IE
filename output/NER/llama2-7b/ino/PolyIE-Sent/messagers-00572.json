In the context of the paragraph, \"ICT effects\" likely refer to the impact of these technologies on the comparison between PQCDTB and PCZDTB.\n2. PQCDTB: The term \"PQCDTB\" represents a framework for evaluating the trade-offs involved in making decisions about investing in information systems. In this context, \"Property Value\" refers to the value of the PQCDTB framework in comparing the ICT effects in the two scenarios.\n3. PCZDTB: The term \"PCZDTB\" represents another framework for evaluating the trade-offs involved in making decisions about investing in information systems. In this context, \"Property Value\" refers to the value of the PCZDTB framework in comparing the ICT effects in the two scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are ICT, PQCDTB, and PCZDTB."
