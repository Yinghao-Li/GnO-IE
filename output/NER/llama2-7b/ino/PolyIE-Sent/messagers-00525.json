Appropriate HOMO / LUMO positions: HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) are important energy levels in a molecule that determine the molecule's electronic properties. The appropriate positions of these levels in PSFDTBT indicate that the molecule has a well-defined electronic structure.\n3. Comparable hole mobility: Hole mobility refers to the ability of a material to transport holes (positive charge carriers). The fact that PSFDTBT has a comparable hole mobility to other materials suggests that it has good electronic conductivity.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Property Value\" entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
