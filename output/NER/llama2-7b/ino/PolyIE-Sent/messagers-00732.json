Thin films\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Optical properties: The paragraph mentions the optical properties of polymers, which refers to the way light interacts with them. This is a property value entity because it describes a characteristic of the polymers.\n2. Polymers: The paragraph mentions the polymers in the context of their optical properties, which means that the term \"polymers\" refers to a set of objects with specific properties. This is a property value entity because it describes a characteristic of the polymers.\n3. Dilute chloroform solutions: The paragraph mentions the optical properties of polymers in dilute chloroform solutions, which means that the term \"dilute chloroform solutions\" refers to a specific type of solution with particular properties. This is a property value entity because it describes a characteristic of the solution.\n4. Thin films: The paragraph mentions the optical properties of polymers in thin films, which means that the term \"thin films\" refers to a specific type of material with particular properties. This is a property value entity because it describes a characteristic of the material.\n\nTherefore, the three property value entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Optical properties\n2. Polymers\n3. Thin films"
