Donor materials: The paragraph mentions the relationship between the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the energy levels of donor materials. Donor materials are materials that donate electrons during an electrochemical reaction.\n2. Acceptor materials: The paragraph also mentions the relationship between Voc and the energy levels of acceptor materials. Acceptor materials are materials that accept electrons during an electrochemical reaction.\n3. Polymers: The paragraph specifically refers to \"low band gap conjugated polymers\", which are a type of polymer material with a low band gap energy. Band gap is the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in a material, and it determines the material's ability to conduct electricity.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Donor materials\n2. Acceptor materials\n3. Polymers"
