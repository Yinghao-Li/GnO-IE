Indacenodithiophene (IDT) is the name of a specific material or compound that has been mentioned in the paragraph. It is a type of organic molecule with a specific structure, which is composed of two thiophene rings held in a rigid arrangement via a central phenyl ring.\n2. Thiophene is a type of organic molecule that is composed of a ring of sulfur atoms. It is a common component of many organic materials, including IDT.\n3. Phenyl is a type of organic molecule that is composed of a ring of carbon atoms with a hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. It is a common component of many organic materials, including IDT.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Indacenodithiophene (IDT)\n2. Thiophene\n3. Phenyl"
