Benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene: This is a specific type of organic molecule that is mentioned in the paragraph as the basis for the new class of materials. The \"benzo\" part of the name indicates that the molecule contains a benzene ring, while the \"dithiophene\" part indicates that the molecule has two thiophene rings linked together.\n2. Imide functionality: This is another specific type of organic group that is mentioned in the paragraph as being present in the molecule. The \"imide\" part of the name indicates that the molecule has a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms, which is a common functional group in organic chemistry.\n\nIn summary, the two material names mentioned in the paragraph are \"benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene\" and \"imide functionality\"."
