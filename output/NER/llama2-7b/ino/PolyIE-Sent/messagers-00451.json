It is a measure of the efficiency of the solar cell in converting sunlight into electrical energy. In the paragraph, the improvement of PCE is mentioned as a result of the enhanced π-π interaction between polymers.\n2. Jsc (Junction Shockley Current): Jsc is the short-circuit current density, which is the current that flows through a solar cell when it is connected in a short-circuit configuration. It is a measure of the current that a solar cell can produce under ideal conditions. In the paragraph, the improvement of Jsc is also mentioned as a result of the enhanced π-π interaction between polymers.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, PCE and Jsc are the two \"Property Value\" entities that are mentioned."
