Low band gap: This is a property of the photovoltaic polymer, which refers to the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands of the material. A lower band gap indicates that the material is more conductive and can absorb a wider range of light.\n4. Enhanced solubility: This is another property of the photovoltaic polymer, which refers to its ability to dissolve in a solvent or solution. A higher solubility means that the material can be more easily dispersed in a solution, which can improve its performance in certain applications.\n\nSo, the Property Name entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* D-A type\n* DTP\n* Low band gap\n* Enhanced solubility"
