Absorption values: The paragraph mentions the \"maxima absorption values\" of PCDSeBT in the film, which refers to the highest levels of absorption of light by the material.\n2. Maxima absorption values: This is a specific type of absorption value, referring to the highest level of absorption observed in the material.\n3.
