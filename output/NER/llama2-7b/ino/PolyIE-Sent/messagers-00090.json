Alkyl side chain: The term \"alkyl side chain\" refers to a specific type of chemical group that is attached to a polymer chain. In this context, the size of the alkyl side chain is being discussed in relation to its impact on the processability and interchain interactions of the polymer.\n2. Polymer: A polymer is a large molecule composed of many repeating units, called monomers, linked together through covalent chemical bonds. In this paragraph, the term \"polymer\" is used to refer to the material being studied.\n3. π-π stacking interactions: π-π stacking interactions refer to the way in which the pi (π) electrons of adjacent molecules in a polymer stack together, creating a strong intermolecular interaction. In this paragraph, the ability of the polymer to optimize these interactions is being discussed as a tool for improving its properties in the solid state."
