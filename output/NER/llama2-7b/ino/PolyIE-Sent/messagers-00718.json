TPD: The term \"TPD\" is mentioned in the paragraph as a material with a simple, symmetric, and planar structure, which makes it suitable for D-A copolymers in PSCs.\n2. DPP: The term \"DPP\" is mentioned in the paragraph as a material that exhibits a strong electron-withdrawing effect due to the presence of electron-deficient lactam rings and strong π-π interactions.\n3. PSCs: The term \"PSCs\" is mentioned in the paragraph as the material that TPD and DPP are used in.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are TPD, DPP, and PSCs."
