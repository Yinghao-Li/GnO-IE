PCDTBT (Polycrystalline Cadmium Telluride Thin Film)\n5. PCDSeBT (Polycrystalline Cadmium Selenide Thin Film)\n\nLet me explain each one:\n\n1. Thermal annealing: This is a process of heating a material to a specific temperature for a certain time period to change its microstructure or properties.\n2. Crystallinity: This refers to the degree of crystallinity of a material, which is a measure of how closely the atoms are arranged in a repeating pattern.\n3. Molecular organization: This refers to the arrangement of molecules in a material, including their orientation and bonding.\n4.
