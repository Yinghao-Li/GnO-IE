Electron: The term \"electron\" refers to a negatively charged subatomic particle that is a fundamental component of atoms and molecules. In the context of polymer solar cells, the mobility of electrons is important for their performance.\n2. Hole: A hole is a positively charged region in an atom or molecule that is created when an electron is removed. In the context of polymer solar cells, the mobility of holes is also important for their performance.\n3. Active layer: The term \"active layer\" refers to the layer of the solar cell that is responsible for absorbing light and converting it into electrical energy. In the context of polymer solar cells, the active layer is typically made of a polymer material that is designed to have high electron and hole mobility."
