      "content": "Sure! Let's break down the paragraph and identify the entities related to \"Property Value\" one by one:\n\n1. PDTP:\nThe paragraph mentions \"PDTP-DTBT\" and \"PDTP-DT2BT\", which suggests that \"PDTP\" is a term that refers to a specific type of material or substance. Therefore, \"Property Value\" related to PDTP could be the roughness of the surface of the blend films fabricated from PDTP.\n2. DTBT:\nThe paragraph compares the roughness of blend films fabricated from PDTP and DCB, and mentions that the blend films fabricated from PDTP-DTBT have a higher RMS value than those fabricated from DCB. This suggests that \"DTBT\" is a term that refers to a specific property or characteristic of the material, such as its roughness. Therefore, \"Property Value\" related to DTBT could be the roughness of the surface of the blend films fabricated from DTBT.\n3. DCB:\nThe paragraph also compares the roughness of blend films fabricated from PDTP and DCB, and mentions that the blend films fabricated from DCB have a smoother surface with a lower RMS value than those fabricated from PDTP. This suggests that \"DCB\" is a term that refers to a specific property or characteristic of the material, such as its smoothness. Therefore, \"Property Value\" related to DCB could be the smoothness of the surface of the blend films fabricated from DCB.\n4. RMS:\nThe paragraph uses the term \"RMS\" to describe the roughness of the surface of the blend films. \"RMS\" is an abbreviation for \"root mean square,\" which is a statistical measure of the magnitude of a set of data. In this context, \"RMS\" is likely used to describe the average roughness of the surface of the blend films, which could be considered a \"Property Value.\"\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* PDTP: roughness of the surface of the blend films fabricated from PDTP\n* DTBT: roughness of the surface of the blend films fabricated from DTBT\n* DCB: smoothness of the surface of the blend films fabricated from DCB\n* RMS: average roughness of the surface of the blend films."
