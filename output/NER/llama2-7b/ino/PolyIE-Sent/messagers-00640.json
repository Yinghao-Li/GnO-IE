Coplanarity: The fused rings make the polymer backbone more coplanar, which means that the polymer chain becomes more flat and parallel to the plane of the backbone.\n3. π-Conjugation: The fused rings enhance the π-conjugation, which refers to the delocalization of electrons along the polymer backbone. This leads to a more stable and conductive polymer.\n4. Bandgap: The fused rings lower the bandgap, which refers to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the polymer. A lower bandgap indicates that the polymer is more conductive.\n5. Absorption: The fused rings extend the absorption, which refers to the range of wavelengths of light that the polymer can absorb. A wider absorption range indicates that the polymer is more versatile and can be used in a wider range of applications.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* Rigidity\n* Coplanarity\n* π-Conjugation\n* Bandgap\n* Absorption"
