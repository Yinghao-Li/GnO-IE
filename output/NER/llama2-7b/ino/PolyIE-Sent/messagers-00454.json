Field-effect mobility: This is a property of the TFTs, which refers to the ability of charge carriers (electrons or holes) to move through the active layer of the transistor.\n2. TFTs: TFTs are a type of transistor that uses a thin film of semiconductor material to control the flow of current. In the context of the paragraph, TFTs are the devices whose field-effect mobility is being studied.\n3. Polymers: Polymers are a class of materials that are composed of long chains of repeating molecules. In the paragraph, polymers are used as the active layer of the TFTs.\n4. Perylene: Perylene is a type of organic compound that is used in the copolymers as the active layer of the TFTs.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\nField-effect mobility, TFTs, polymers, and perylene."
