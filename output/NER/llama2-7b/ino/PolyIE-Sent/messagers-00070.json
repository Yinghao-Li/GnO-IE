LUMO energy levels: In this context, \"LUMO\" refers to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of a molecule or material. The corresponding energy levels were calculated in the paragraph.\n2. HOMO energy level: HOMO stands for highest occupied molecular orbital energy level. In this context, the HOMO energy level is the highest energy level at which an electron is most likely to be found in a molecule or material.\n3. onset absorption of polymers: Onset absorption refers to the energy at which a material or molecule begins to absorb light. In this context, the onset absorption of polymers in thin films is mentioned, which refers to the energy at which the polymers in thin films begin to absorb light."
