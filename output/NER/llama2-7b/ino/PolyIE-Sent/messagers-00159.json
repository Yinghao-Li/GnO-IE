CHCl3 solution: This is a property value entity as it represents the solution of a chemical compound in a solvent, which is a measurable property.\n3. Thin films: This is a property value entity as it represents the thickness of a layer of material deposited on a surface, which is a measurable property.\n4. Quartz plates: This is a property value entity as it represents the material properties of the plates, such as their thickness, density, and other physical properties, which are measurable.\n\nTherefore, the three entities that can be identified as \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
