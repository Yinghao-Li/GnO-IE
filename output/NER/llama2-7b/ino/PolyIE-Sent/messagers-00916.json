Let's go through the paragraph step by step and identify the \"Material Name\" entities:\n\n1. \"polymers\" - This is a general term that refers to a class of materials composed of long chains of repeating molecules. It is not a specific material name.\n2. \"DSC analysis\" - DSC stands for Differential Scanning Calorimetry, which is a technique used to measure the thermal properties of materials. It is not a material name.\n3. \"TGA analysis\" - TGA stands for Thermogravimetry Analysis, which is another technique used to measure the thermal properties of materials. It is not a material name.\n4. \"T d\" - This is an abbreviation for \"decomposition temperature\", which is a specific temperature at which a material undergoes decomposition. It is not a material name.\n5. \"polymers\" - As mentioned earlier, this is a general term that refers to a class of materials composed of long chains of repeating molecules.\n\nSo, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"polymers\" (mentioned twice)\n\nI hope this helps!
