This transition is specific to conjugated polymers like PFDTBT.\n4. ICT interaction: This is an abbreviation for \"internal charge-transfer\" interaction, which refers to the transfer of electrons between different parts of a molecule. In the context of the paragraph, this interaction is between donating and accepting groups in the main chain of the ter-polymer solutions.\n\nSo, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
