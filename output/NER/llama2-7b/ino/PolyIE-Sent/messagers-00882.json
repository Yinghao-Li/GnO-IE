Copolymers are a type of polymer that is composed of two or more different monomers.\n2. Solubility - This is a property of the copolymers, which refers to their ability to dissolve in a solvent. Good solubility means that the copolymers can easily dissolve in a solvent, while poor solubility means that they have difficulty dissolving.\n3. Thermal stability - This is another property of the copolymers, which refers to their ability to withstand high temperatures without degrading or breaking down. Thermal stability is important for materials that are exposed to high temperatures during processing or use.\n4. Bandgap - This is a property of the copolymers, which refers to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in the molecule. A low bandgap means that the copolymers can efficiently absorb and harvest photons with lower energies, while a high bandgap means that they are less efficient at absorbing and harvesting photons.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Copolymers\n2. Solubility\n3. Thermal stability\n4. Bandgap"
