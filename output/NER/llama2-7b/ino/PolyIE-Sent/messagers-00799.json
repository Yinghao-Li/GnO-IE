Hole mobilities: The term \"hole mobilities\" refers to the ability of holes (positive charge carriers) to move within a material. In this context, the paragraph states that the hole mobilities are among the highest values in the current reports, indicating that the material has high mobility.\n2. PCEs: The term \"PCEs\" stands for \"power conversion efficiencies.\" In the context of optoelectronic devices, PCEs refer to the efficiency of converting light into electrical energy. The paragraph states that the PCEs are also among the highest values in the current reports, indicating that the material has high efficiency in converting light into electrical energy.\n3. Naphthodithiophene-based polymers: The term \"naphthodithiophene-based polymers\" refers to a class of materials that are composed of naphthodithiophene units linked together through chemical bonds. In the context of the paragraph, these materials are being compared to other materials in terms of their property values.\n4. D-A copolymers: The term \"D-A copolymers\" refers to a specific type of copolymer that is composed of alternating units of two different monomers, called \"D\" and \"A.\" In the context of the paragraph, the D-A copolymers are being referred to as \"zigzag\" naphthodithiophene-based copolymers.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hole mobilities\n2. PCEs\n3. Naphthodithiophene-based polymers\n4. D-A copolymers"
