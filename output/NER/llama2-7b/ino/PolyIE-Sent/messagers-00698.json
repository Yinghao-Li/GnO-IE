HOMO: HOMO stands for \"Hydrogen Overall Mobility,\" which refers to the energy level at which the electrons in a molecule are most easily excited. In this context, the HOMO of -6.2 eV indicates that the electrons in the molecule are most easily excited at an energy level of -6.2 eV.\n3.

In this context, the LUMO of -3.1 eV indicates that the electrons in the molecule are least likely to be found at an energy level of -3.1 eV.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are the names of the molecule (Dithieno-[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide) and two energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) that describe the electronic properties of the molecule."
