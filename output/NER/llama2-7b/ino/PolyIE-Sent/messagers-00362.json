AM 1.5G (Air Mass 1.5 Global)\n3. J SC (J-V Products SC)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. IPCE (Intercepted Photon-Counting Efficiency): This is a measure of the efficiency of a solar panel or module in converting incident photons into electrical current. It is calculated by dividing the short-circuit current (ISC) by the incident irradiance (P).\n2. AM 1.5G (Air Mass 1.5 Global): This is a reference spectrum used to simulate the solar irradiance at a location on Earth. The AM 1.5G spectrum represents the average solar irradiance at a location with an air mass of 1.5, which is a common value used in solar cell testing and simulation.\n3. J SC (J-V Products SC): This is a product or device that is used to measure the intercepted photon-counting efficiency of a solar panel or module. The J SC value is calculated by integrating the IPCE data with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum."
