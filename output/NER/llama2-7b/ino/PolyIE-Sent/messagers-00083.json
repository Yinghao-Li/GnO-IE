Here are the ones I found:\n\n1. PffBB-10: This is mentioned several times in the paragraph as the material used for the active layer in the device. Therefore, it can be considered as a \"Material Name\" entity.\n2. decyl-substituted PffBB-10: This is a modified version of PffBB-10, where decyl (a type of alkyl group) has been substituted. This modified material is used in the device and is mentioned in the paragraph.\n3. V oc: This stands for \"open-circuit voltage\" and is a measure of the maximum voltage that a solar cell can achieve when there is no load connected to it. It is mentioned in the paragraph as a value of 0.93 V for the device using PffBB-10.\n4. J sc: This stands for \"short-circuit current\" and is a measure of the maximum current that a solar cell can achieve when there is no resistance in the circuit. It is mentioned in the paragraph as a value of 14.62 mA cm^-2 for the device using PffBB-10.\n5. FF: This stands for \"fill factor\" and is a measure of the efficiency of a solar cell. It is mentioned in the paragraph as a value of 60.44% for the device using PffBB-10.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
