LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital)\n3. onset oxidation potentials\n4. reduction potentials\n5. ferrocene / ferrocenium\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. HOMO and LUMO are property names used in the context of molecular orbitals. HOMO refers to the hydrogen-bonded molecular orbital, which is the highest occupied molecular orbital, and LUMO refers to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, which is the lowest energy orbital that is not occupied by an electron.\n2. onset oxidation and reduction potentials are property names used to describe the potential energy of a reaction. Onset oxidation potential refers to the potential energy of a reaction at which the oxidation reaction begins, while onset reduction potential refers to the potential energy of a reaction at which the reduction reaction begins.\n3. ferrocene / ferrocenium are property names used to describe a specific molecule or ion. Ferrocene is a molecule consisting of two cyclopentadienyl rings bound to a central iron atom, while ferrocenium is the positively charged ion of ferrocene.\n\nIn summary, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are HOMO, LUMO, onset oxidation potentials, onset reduction potentials, and ferrocene / ferrocenium."
