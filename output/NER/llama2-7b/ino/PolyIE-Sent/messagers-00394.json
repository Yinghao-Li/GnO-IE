Flat perylene units: The term \"flat perylene units\" refers to a specific property of the conjugated polymers, which is the shape or structure of the perylene molecules. Perylene is a type of organic compound that has a planar, flat molecular structure.\n2. Conjugated polymers: The term \"conjugated polymers\" refers to a class of polymers that have a repeating structure in which two or more alternating double bonds are present in each repeating unit. This structure gives conjugated polymers unique electronic and optical properties, such as high conductivity and fluorescence.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are \"flat perylene units\" and \"conjugated polymers\"."
