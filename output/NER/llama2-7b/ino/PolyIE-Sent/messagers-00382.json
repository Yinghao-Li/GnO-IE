It is a type of polymer that contains perylene, which is a conjugated polymer that can absorb light and generate charge.\n2. \"Device\" refers to the overall device that was fabricated using the perylene-containing copolymer. It is not a specific material, but rather a collection of materials that work together to create a functional device."
