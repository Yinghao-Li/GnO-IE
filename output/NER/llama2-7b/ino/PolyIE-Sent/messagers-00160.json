Optical band gap: This is the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the material, which can be determined from the absorption onset.\n\nTherefore, these two entities are the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph."
