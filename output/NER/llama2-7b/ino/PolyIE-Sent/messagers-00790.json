PSC (Polymer Solar Cell)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. DPP refers to the variation of dopant polymer proximity, which is a property value that describes the distance between the dopant molecules and the polymer backbone.\n2. TPD refers to the triplet polymer dopant, which is a property value that describes the type of dopant molecule used in the polymer.\n3. PSC refers to the polymer solar cell, which is a device that converts light into electrical energy. The performance of the device is dependent on various properties, including the properties of the polymer itself, such as its conductivity, crystallinity, and doping level.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, the entities \"DPP\" and \"TPD\" are property values that describe the properties of the polymer, while \"PSC\" is a device property that is dependent on the properties of the polymer."
