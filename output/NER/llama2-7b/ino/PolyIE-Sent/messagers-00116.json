Active blend layer: This is a material or a layer that is specifically mentioned in the paragraph, and it is likely that the author is referring to a particular type of material or structure.\n2. Exciton: An exciton is a quasiparticle that arises from the interaction of an electron and a hole in a material. In the context of the paragraph, the author is likely referring to excitons as the carriers of the material that are affected by the smaller domain sizes.\n3. Recombination loss: Recombination loss refers to the process by which excitons recombine with each other, resulting in the loss of energy and the emission of light. In the context of the paragraph, the author is likely referring to the recombination loss that occurs in the active blend layer due to the smaller domain sizes."
