Size of alkyl side chains: In this paragraph, the size of the alkyl side chains attached to the polymer backbone is mentioned as a factor that affects the aggregation of the polymer. The size of the alkyl side chains can be considered as a property value.\n2. Solvent used: The paragraph mentions that the solvent used can also affect the aggregation of the polymer. The solvent used can influence the properties of the polymer, such as its solubility, conformational stability, and optical properties, which can be considered as property values.\n3. Temperature applied: The paragraph states that the temperature applied to the film can also modulate the aggregation of the polymer. The temperature can affect the thermal stability and conformational dynamics of the polymer, which can influence its optical properties and can be considered as property values.\n4. Optical band gap: The paragraph mentions that the optical band gap of the polymer can be extended down to ∼ 780 nm in thin films. The optical band gap is a measure of the energy range of electromagnetic radiation that can be absorbed by the polymer, and it can be considered as a property value.\n5. Narrow optical band gap: The paragraph also states that the optical band gap of the polymer is narrow, which means that the polymer has a limited range of absorption. The narrowness of the optical band gap can be considered as a property value.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to \"Property Value\" in the paragraph are:\n\n* Size of alkyl side chains\n* Solvent used\n* Temperature applied\n* Optical band gap\n* Narrow optical band gap"
