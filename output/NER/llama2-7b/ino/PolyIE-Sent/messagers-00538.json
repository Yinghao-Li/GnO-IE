Copolymer containing terthiophene: This is the name of the material being studied, which is a copolymer containing terthiophene.\n2. Diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative: This is another name for a material that is being studied, which is a derivative of diketopyrrolopyrrole.\n3. PCE: PCE stands for \"Power Conversion Efficiency\", which is a measure of the efficiency of a solar cell. In this context, the value of 4.7% refers to the PCE of the material being studied.\n4. Hole mobility: Hole mobility refers to the speed at which holes (positive charge carriers) can move within a material. The value of 0.04 cm^2 V^-1 S^-1 refers to the hole mobility of the material being studied."
