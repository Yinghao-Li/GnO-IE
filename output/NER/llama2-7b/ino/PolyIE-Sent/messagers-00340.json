OFET: This is a type of transistor that is used in organic electronics, and its mobility is being calculated in the saturation regime using the given equation. Therefore, \"OFET\" can be considered a material name entity.\n2. insulation layer: The capacitance per unit area of the insulation layer is being calculated in the equation, which implies that the insulation layer is a material that is present in the device. Therefore, \"insulation layer\" can also be considered a material name entity."
