Band gap: This is a property of a material that refers to the energy difference between the valence band and conduction band of a solid. The band gap is an important property in the context of solar cells, as it determines the range of energies that can be absorbed by the material and converted into electrical current.\n2. Photocurrent: This is a measure of the current generated in a solar cell when it is exposed to light. The photocurrent is directly related to the amount of light absorbed by the material and the efficiency of the solar cell.\n3. Solar spectrum: This refers to the distribution of light across the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible and invisible light. The solar spectrum is important in the context of solar cells, as different materials have different absorption spectra and can be optimized for different parts of the spectrum.\n4. Red and near-infrared ranges: These are specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, with the red range covering wavelengths between approximately 600-700 nanometers and the near-infrared range covering wavelengths between approximately 700-1000 nanometers. These ranges are important in the context of solar cells, as materials with high absorption in these ranges can lead to higher photocurrents."
