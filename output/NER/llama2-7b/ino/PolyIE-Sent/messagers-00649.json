The term \"π-electron\" refers to the number of pi (π) electrons in the molecule, and \"deficient\" means that the molecule has fewer pi electrons than a typical imide molecule.\n2. polymers: This is a broader term that refers to a class of materials that are composed of long chains of repeating molecular units. In this context, the term \"polymers\" is used to describe the material to which the π-electron - deficient imide moiety is being introduced."

This suggests that the introduction of this moiety can make the polymers more stable in air, as a lower HOMO energy and a higher LUMO energy are generally associated with increased stability."
