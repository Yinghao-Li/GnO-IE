Carboxylate side chains are a type of organic molecule that contains a carboxyl (-COOH) group.\n3. \"vinylene linkers\" refers to the specific type of linker that is used to connect the thiophene units in the PT - based donor materials. Vinylene linkers are a type of organic molecule that contains a carbon-carbon double bond."
