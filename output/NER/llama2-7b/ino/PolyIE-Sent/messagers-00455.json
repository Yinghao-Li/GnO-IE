Polymers: The paragraph mentions the use of polymers as an electron donor in the fabrication of photovoltaic devices. Therefore, \"polymers\" is a material name entity.\n2. Perylene: The paragraph mentions the increase in short circuit currents of the photovoltaic devices as the perylene content in the copolymers increases. Therefore, \"perylene\" is a material name entity.\n3. Photovoltaic devices: The paragraph mentions the fabrication of photovoltaic devices using the polymers as an electron donor. Therefore, \"photovoltaic devices\" is a material name entity."
