Polymers: The paragraph is discussing the absorption bands of three different polymers, so \"polymers\" is the Material Name entity in this context.\n2. IDT (pi-pi* transition): The paragraph mentions the π-π* transition of the IDT unit, which is a specific type of molecular structure. Therefore, \"IDT\" is a Material Name entity in this context.\n3.
