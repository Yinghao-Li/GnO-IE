Phase - This is a material name, as it refers to a specific phase of matter (e.g., solid, liquid, gas).\n3. Separation - This is not a material name, as it is a general term that refers to the act of separating or dividing something.\n4. Exhibits - This is not a material name, as it is a verb that means to display or show something.\n5. Low - This is not a material name, as it is an adjective that modifies the noun \"photocurrent\".\n6. Photocurrent - This is a material name, as it refers to a specific type of current generated by a material in response to light.\n7. Charge - This is not a material name, as it is a general term that refers to a unit of electric charge.\n8. Separation - This is not a material name, as it is a general term that refers to the act of separating or dividing something.\n9. Recombination - This is not a material name, as it is a verb that refers to the process of combining two or more things.\n10. Electric charges - This is not a material name, as it is a general term that refers to a unit of electric charge.\n\nTherefore, the only material name entities in the given paragraph are \"Phase\" and \"Photocurrent\"."
