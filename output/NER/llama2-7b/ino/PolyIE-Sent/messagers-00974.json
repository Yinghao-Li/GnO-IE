Polymer: The paragraph is discussing the properties of a specific type of polymer, which is a material composed of long chains of repeating molecular units.\n2. Fused aromatic unit: The paragraph mentions the incorporation of an \"extended fused aromatic unit\" in the polymer backbone. An aromatic unit is a type of molecular unit that contains a planar, unsaturated ring of carbon atoms. By \"fused,\" the author means that the aromatic unit is connected to the polymer backbone through a chemical bond.\n3. Polymer backbone: The polymer backbone refers to the main chain of the polymer, which is composed of repeating molecular units that are linked together through chemical bonds. The author is discussing how the incorporation of the fused aromatic unit affects the properties of the polymer backbone."
