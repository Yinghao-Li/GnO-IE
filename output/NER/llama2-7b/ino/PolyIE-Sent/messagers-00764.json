Optimized molecular geometries: The paragraph mentions the optimized molecular geometries of the models, which are the spatial arrangements of the atoms in the molecule that have been optimized to minimize the energy of the system. This is a property value that describes the spatial arrangement of the atoms in the molecule.\n2. HOMO frontier orbital: The paragraph mentions the calculated HOMO frontier orbital, which is one of the highest occupied molecular orbitals in the molecule. This is a property value that describes the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital.\n3. LUMO frontier orbital: The paragraph also mentions the calculated LUMO frontier orbital, which is one of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals in the molecule. This is a property value that describes the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.\n\nIn summary, the paragraph is describing the calculated properties of the molecular models, including their optimized geometries, HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals, which are property values that describe the energy of the molecular orbitals."
