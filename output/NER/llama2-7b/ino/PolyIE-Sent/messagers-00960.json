Solar cell devices\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Polymers: The paragraph mentions \"All polymers\" which refers to a class of materials composed of long chains of repeating molecules. In this context, \"polymers\" is a material name.\n2. HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) levels: The paragraph mentions \"HOMO levels\" which refers to the energy levels in a molecule that are occupied by electrons. In this context, \"HOMO levels\" is a material property or characteristic, and it is a material name.\n3. Solar cell devices: The paragraph mentions \"solar cell devices\" which refers to the devices that convert light into electrical energy. In this context, \"solar cell devices\" is a material name.\n\nTherefore, the three material names mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Polymers\n2. HOMO levels\n3. Solar cell devices"
