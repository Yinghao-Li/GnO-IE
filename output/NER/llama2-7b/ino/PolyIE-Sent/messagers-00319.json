Gel - permeation chromatography (GPC) is a separation technique used to separate and analyze polymers based on their size and molecular weight. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the method used for purification.\n2. PS (Polystyrene) is a polymer standard used for calibration and comparison of the molecular weight of the sample separated by GPC. It is also mentioned in the paragraph as the standard used for comparison."
