However, we can identify some potential entities that could be related to disease or health conditions:\n\n1. Male Wistar rats: These are the animals that are being studied, and they are a type of rodent.\n2. Training sessions: The training sessions could be related to exercise or physical activity, which can have both positive and negative effects on health.\n3. Treadmill: A treadmill is a piece of exercise equipment that is commonly used to study exercise physiology and cardiovascular health.\n4. Swimming pool: Swimming is a form of exercise that can be beneficial for cardiovascular health, but it can also be a stressor on the body.\n\nSo, while there are no direct mentions of disease entities in the paragraph, there are some potential entities that could be related to health or disease."},

Disease: This is the most obvious entity in the paragraph, as it is mentioned explicitly.\n2. Swimming pool: While this entity is not directly related to disease, it could potentially be a source of waterborne illnesses or infections.\n\nSo, the two entities that clearly refer to disease in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Disease\n2. Swimming pool (as a potential source of waterborne illnesses)"},
