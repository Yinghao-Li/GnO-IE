Glial activation - This refers to the activation of glial cells, which are non-neuronal cells that provide support and maintenance functions for neurons.\n2. Post-synaptic neurotoxicity - This refers to the damage or death of neurons caused by toxic substances that act on the post-synaptic side of the neuron, i.e., the side of the neuron that receives signals from other neurons.\n3. STZ - This stands for streptozotocin, which is a chemical toxin that is commonly used to induce diabetes in laboratory animals. In the context of the paragraph, STZ is being used to induce memory impairment and neuronal cell death.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
