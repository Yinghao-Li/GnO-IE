To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Left atrial\" - This refers to a specific part of the heart, the left atrium, which is affected by the disease.\n2. \"Left ventricular\" - This refers to another specific part of the heart, the left ventricle, which is also affected by the disease.\n3. \"Papillary muscle\" - This refers to a specific structure within the heart, the papillary muscles, which are affected by the disease.\n4. \"Contractile responses\" - This refers to the ability of the heart muscle to contract and respond to stimuli, which is affected by the disease.\n5. \"Isoproterenol\" - This is a specific drug or substance that is being studied in the paragraph, and its effects on the heart are being described.\n6. \"Clentiazem\" - This is another drug or substance that is being studied in the paragraph, and its effects on the heart are being described in comparison to isoproterenol.\n7. \"Epinephrine\" - This is another drug or substance that is being studied in the paragraph, and its effects on the heart are being described in combination with clentiazem.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Left atrial disease\n* Left ventricular disease\n* Papillary muscle disease\n\nThese are the specific parts of the heart that are affected by the disease, as described in the paragraph."},
