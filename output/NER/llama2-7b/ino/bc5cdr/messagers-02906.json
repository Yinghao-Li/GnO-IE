To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"She developed\" - This phrase indicates that the subject (She) experienced something new or changed.\n2. \"relapsed disease\" - This phrase suggests that the subject had a previous illness or condition that has returned after a period of remission or improvement.\n3. \"10 months later\" - This phrase provides additional information about the timing of the event, indicating that the relapse occurred 10 months after the initial illness or condition.\n4. \"with leukemic involvement\" - This phrase suggests that the relapse is related to leukemia, which is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Relapsed disease\n* Leukemia"},
