Cardiac hypertrophy: This is a disease entity, as it is a condition where the heart muscle becomes enlarged.\n2. Acute congestion: This is a symptom of the disease entity cardiac hypertrophy, as it refers to fluid accumulation in the lungs.\n3. Chronic congestion: This is also a symptom of cardiac hypertrophy, as it refers to long-term fluid accumulation in the lungs.\n4. Lung congestion: This is a disease entity, as it is a condition where the lungs are unable to properly expand and contract due to fluid accumulation.\n5. Liver congestion: This is a disease entity, as it is a condition where the liver becomes enlarged due to fluid accumulation.\n6. Other organs congestion: This is a disease entity, as it refers to fluid accumulation in other organs in the body, which can be caused by various diseases.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cardiac hypertrophy\n* Lung congestion\n* Liver congestion\n* Other organs congestion"},
