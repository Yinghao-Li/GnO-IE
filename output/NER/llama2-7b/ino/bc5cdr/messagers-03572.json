To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Increase in intragastric pressure during suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations in children\" - This is a disease entity, as it describes a specific symptom (muscle fasciculations) that occurs in children after being administered a certain drug (suxamethonium).\n2. \"suxamethonium\" - This is a drug entity, as it is a specific medication that is used to induce muscle relaxation.\n3. \"alfentanil\" - This is also a drug entity, as it is another medication that is used to inhibit the effects of suxamethonium.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Muscle fasciculations\n* Suxamethonium\n\nThe drug entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Suxamethonium\n* Alfentanil"},
