Dopaminergic neurotransmission: This refers to the transmission of dopamine signals between neurons in the brain. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter involved in various physiological processes, including movement, motivation, and reward processing. Dysregulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, addiction, and schizophrenia.\n2. Parkinson's disease: This is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and difficulty with movement.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

It is a gas that is involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission.\n2. dopaminergic neurotransmission: This is the second chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motivation, reward, and movement control.\n3. striatum: This is the third chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. The striatum is a structure in the brain that is involved in the production and release of dopamine.\n\nSo, the three chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Nitric oxide (NO)\n2. dopamine\n3. striatum"},
