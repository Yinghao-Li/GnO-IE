Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * Decreased\n * left\n * ventricular\n * systolic\n * function\n * patients\n * controls\n2. Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Decreased left ventricular systolic function\n * patients\n * controls\n3. Identify the disease entities in the paragraph:\n * Decreased left ventricular systolic function is likely to be a disease entity, as it is a measure of a specific abnormality in the heart.\n * Patients are the individuals who have the disease or condition being studied.\n * Controls are individuals who do not have the disease or condition being studied, and are used for comparison.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Decreased left ventricular systolic function\n* Patients\n* Controls"},
