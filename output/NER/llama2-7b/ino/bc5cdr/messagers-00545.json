OR (Odds Ratio) - a statistical measure used to compare the odds of an event occurring between two groups.\n2. 95% CI (95% Confidence Interval) - a range of values that contains the true value of a statistical estimate with a specified level of confidence.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. OR is a mathematical calculation used to compare the odds of an event occurring between two groups. It is a chemical entity because it is a statistical measure that is used to quantify the relationship between two variables.\n2. 95% CI is a range of values that contains the true value of a statistical estimate with a specified level of confidence. It is a chemical entity because it represents a range of values that are used to estimate a population parameter.\n\nNote: In this context, \"Chemical\" refers to the type of entity, not the substance itself. These entities are chemical entities in the sense that they are mathematical or statistical measures used to analyze and interpret data, rather than physical substances."},
