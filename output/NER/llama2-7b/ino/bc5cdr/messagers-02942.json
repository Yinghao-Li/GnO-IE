Based on the context, the following entities can be identified:\n\n1. Myocardial contrast enhancement: This refers to the visualization of the heart muscle using a contrast agent during a medical imaging procedure, such as a CT scan.\n2. Elevations in cTnI: This refers to the levels of a protein called creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) in the blood, which can be elevated in response to damage to the heart muscle.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is likely related to heart disease or myocardial infarction (heart attack)."},
