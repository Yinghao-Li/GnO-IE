Histological: This is a term used in pathology to describe the study of the structure of tissues and cells under a microscope. It is a chemical process in the sense that it involves the use of chemical stains and techniques to visualize and analyze the tissue structure.\n2. Biopsies: This is a medical procedure in which a small sample of tissue is removed from the body for examination. The term \"biopsy\" refers to the chemical process of cutting or removing the tissue sample from the body.\n3. Orthopaedic Traumatological Centre: This is a medical facility that specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, including muscle injuries. The term \"Orthopaedic\" refers to the study of the musculoskeletal system, which involves chemical processes such as the synthesis and degradation of muscle tissue.\n4. Florence: This is a city in Italy where the biopsies were performed. The term \"Florence\" does not refer to any chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Histological\n2. Biopsies\n3.
