AQP2: This is a protein entity, specifically the aquaporin-2 water channel protein.\n2. WT mice: WT stands for \"wild-type,\" which refers to the normal or unmutated form of a gene or protein. In this context, WT mice are the normal mice used in the experiment.\n3. PKCa: PKCa stands for \"protein kinase C alpha,\" which is a type of enzyme or protein.\n4. KO: KO stands for \"knockout,\" which refers to the absence or deletion of a gene or protein. In this context, PKCa KO means that the mice lack the PKCa protein.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* AQP2 (protein)\n* WT (wild-type)\n* PKCa (protein kinase C alpha)\n* KO (knockout)"},
