Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * Quinacrine hydrochloride\n * heart\n * F - 344 rats\n2. Identify the nouns that could potentially be disease entities:\n * heart (could be a disease or a part of the body)\n * F - 344 rats (could be a disease or a breed of rat)\n3. Eliminate nouns that are not disease entities:\n * Quinacrine hydrochloride (not a disease)\n * rats (not a disease)\n4.
