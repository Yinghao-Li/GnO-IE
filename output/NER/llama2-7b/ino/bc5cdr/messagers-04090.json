Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n\n* Gastrointestinal\n* side effects\n* CPDD\n\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n\n* Gastrointestinal: gastrointestinal\n* side effects: effects\n* CPDD: CPDD (no noun)\n\n3. Check if any of the nouns are disease entities:\n\n* Gastrointestinal: No, \"gastrointestinal\" is not a disease entity. It is an adjective phrase modifying the noun \"effects\".\n* side effects: No, \"side effects\" is not a disease entity. It is a noun phrase modifying the verb \"were\".\n* CPDD: Yes, \"CPDD\" is a disease entity. It stands for \"Chronic Pelvic Pain Disease\".\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"CPDD\"."},
