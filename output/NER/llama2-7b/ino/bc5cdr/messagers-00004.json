To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Positive skin tests\" - This suggests that the patient has a skin reaction to something, which could be a sign of an allergic reaction or an immune response.\n2. \"in late reactions to radiographic contrast media\" - This tells us that the skin reaction is occurring after the patient has been exposed to a certain substance, in this case, radiographic contrast media.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Allergic reaction\n* Immune response\n\nThese are the diseases or conditions that the paragraph is referring to."},
