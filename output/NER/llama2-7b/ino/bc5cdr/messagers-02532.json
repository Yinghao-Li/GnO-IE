Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is the comparison of mortality rates between different treatment groups.\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph: In the paragraph, the following entities are mentioned:\n * Mortality\n * Treatment groups\n * Control\n3. Determine whether each entity is a disease or not:\n * Mortality: No, mortality is not a disease, it is a measure of the rate of deaths in a population.\n * Treatment groups: No, treatment groups are not diseases, they are categories of patients who receive different treatments.\n * Control: No, control is not a disease, it is a group of patients who do not receive any treatment.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
