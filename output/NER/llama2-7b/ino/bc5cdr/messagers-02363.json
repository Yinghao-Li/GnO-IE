Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * P2X3 receptor\n * NK1 receptor\n * Urothelium\n * Suburothelium\n2. Determine whether each entity is a disease or a normal anatomical structure:\n * P2X3 receptor: Not a disease, a receptor protein found on the surface of cells.\n * NK1 receptor: Not a disease, a receptor protein found on the surface of cells.\n * Urothelium: A normal anatomical structure that lines the inner surface of the urinary tract.\n * Suburothelium: A normal anatomical structure that is located beneath the urothelium.\n3. Identify any diseases or disorders associated with the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * None of the entities mentioned in the paragraph are explicitly associated with any diseases or disorders.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are: None."},
