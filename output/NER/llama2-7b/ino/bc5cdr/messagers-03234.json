Disease activity markers - This refers to measures used to assess the severity or progression of a disease, such as inflammation or infection.\n2. Signs of ocular inflammation - This refers to any visible or measurable changes in the eye that are caused by inflammation, such as redness, swelling, or discharge.\n3. Retinal vasculitis - This refers to inflammation of the blood vessels in the retina, which can cause damage to the retina and affect vision.\n4. Swedish interactive threshold algorithm - This is a specific method used to measure visual field loss in patients with ocular diseases, such as glaucoma or retinal detachment.\n5. Humphrey visual field analysis - This is another method used to measure visual field loss, which involves detecting the extent of visual field loss in patients with ocular diseases.\n6. Electroretinographic parameters - These are measures of the electrical activity of the retina, which can be used to assess the function of the retina and diagnose retinal diseases.\n7. Optical coherence tomography - This is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses light waves to produce detailed images of the retina and optic nerve, which can be used to diagnose and monitor retinal diseases.\n\nI hope this helps!
