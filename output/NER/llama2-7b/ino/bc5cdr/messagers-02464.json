Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is discussing the measurement of busulfan levels in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of children without central nervous system disease.\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Busulfan: a drug used to treat cancer\n * Central nervous system disease: a disease affecting the brain and spinal cord\n * Clonazepam: a drug used to treat seizures and anxiety\n * Cerebrospinal fluid: a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord\n * Plasma: the liquid part of the blood that carries cells and proteins\n3. Determine whether each entity is a \"Disease\" entity:\n * Busulfan: No, busulfan is a drug, not a disease.\n * Central nervous system disease: No, central nervous system disease is a broader term that encompasses a range of diseases and disorders affecting the brain and spinal cord.\n * Clonazepam: No, clonazepam is a drug, not a disease.\n * Cerebrospinal fluid: No, cerebrospinal fluid is a fluid, not a disease.\n * Plasma: No, plasma is a fluid, not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the only \"Disease\" entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"central nervous system disease\"."},
