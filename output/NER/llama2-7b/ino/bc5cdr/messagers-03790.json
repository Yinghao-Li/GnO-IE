Homozygous (jj): Homozygous refers to an individual that has two copies of the same gene, one from each parent. In this context, \"jj\" is likely referring to a genetic disorder caused by homozygous inheritance.\n2. Phenotypically normal heterozygous (jJ): Heterozygous refers to an individual that has two different copies of a gene, one from each parent. In this context, \"jJ\" is likely referring to an individual that is phenotypically normal, meaning they do not exhibit any obvious physical or behavioral abnormalities, but they are heterozygous for a particular gene."},

Homozygous: This is a genetic term that refers to an individual that has two copies of the same gene, one inherited from each parent.
