    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Myocardial strain: This refers to the stretching or deformation of the muscular walls of the heart.\n2. Cardiac troponin T (cTnT): This is a protein that is released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged, as in the case of a heart attack. High-sensitive cardiac troponin T tests can detect very small amounts of this protein in the blood, indicating recent cardiac damage.\n3. Cardiac dysfunction: This refers to any abnormality in the functioning of the heart, such as reduced pumping capacity, abnormal heart rhythms, or other problems.\n\nSo, the paragraph is investigating whether changes in myocardial strain and high levels of cardiac troponin T in the blood can predict future cardiac dysfunction in patients who have been exposed to epirubicin."},
