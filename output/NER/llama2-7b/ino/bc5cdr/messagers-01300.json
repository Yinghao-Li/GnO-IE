Status epilepticus: This is a medical condition in which a person experiences seizures that last for an abnormally long time, often for more than 30 minutes. Status epilepticus can be caused by various factors, including infections, head injuries, and genetic disorders.\n2. Ectopic granule cell population: This refers to a group of cells that are abnormally located outside of their normal position in the brain. In the context of the paragraph, the \"hilar ectopic granule cell population\" refers to a group of cells that are located in the hilus, a region of the brain that is involved in the formation and processing of memories.\n\nSo, while the term \"Disease\" does not appear in the paragraph, we can identify two entities that are related to disease: status epilepticus and the ectopic granule cell population."},
