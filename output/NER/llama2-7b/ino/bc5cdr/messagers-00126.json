Hypercalcemia: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It refers to an abnormal increase in the level of calcium in the blood.\n2. Malignancies: This refers to cancerous conditions. The authors mention that some of the patients in group A (non-lithium-treated patients with hypercalcemias related to malignancies) have cancer.\n3. Lithium-associated hypercalcemia: This refers to an abnormal increase in calcium levels that is caused by lithium, a medication used to treat bipolar disorder.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypercalcemia\n2. Malignancies\n3. Lithium-associated hypercalcemia"},
