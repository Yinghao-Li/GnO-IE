Withdrawal can cause a range of symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia, nausea, and tremors.\n2. Re: This is likely a abbreviation for \"relapse,\" which is a common term in the context of addiction and substance use disorder.\n3. Rg1: This is likely a abbreviation for \"relapse prevention,\" which is a term used in the context of addiction treatment to refer to strategies and techniques aimed at preventing a person from relapsing back into drug use.\n4. Rb1: This is likely a abbreviation for \"relapse,\" which is a term used in the context of addiction to refer to the return of drug use after a period of abstinence.\n\nTherefore, the entities identified as \"Disease\" in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
