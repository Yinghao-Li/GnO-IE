Cardiomyocyte degeneration: This refers to the degeneration or death of cardiomyocytes, which are the muscle cells of the heart.\n2. Hypertrophy: This refers to the enlargement of cardiomyocytes, which can occur as a result of various cardiac conditions, including hypertension, heart failure, and genetic disorders.\n3. Cytomegaly: This refers to an increase in the size of cardiomyocytes, which can occur due to various factors, including genetic mutations, infection, or inflammation.\n4. Vacuolation: This refers to the presence of small vacuoles or cavities within cardiomyocytes, which can occur due to various factors, including injury, infection, or genetic disorders.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cardiomyocyte degeneration\n2. Hypertrophy\n3. Cytomegaly\n4. Vacuolation"},
