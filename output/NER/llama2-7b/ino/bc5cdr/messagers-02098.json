Parkinsonian disability: This refers to the disability associated with Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and balance.\n3. Dyskinesia: This is a type of movement disorder that is often associated with Parkinson's disease. It is characterized by involuntary, abnormal movements of the face, torso, and limbs.\n4. Motor fluctuations: This refers to the fluctuations in motor function that can occur in Parkinson's disease, including periods of increased movement (called \"on-time\") and periods of reduced movement (called \"off-time\").\n5. Neuropsychiatric-like behaviors: This refers to behaviors that are similar to those seen in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and psychosis. These behaviors can be associated with Parkinson's disease, particularly in the later stages of the disease."},
