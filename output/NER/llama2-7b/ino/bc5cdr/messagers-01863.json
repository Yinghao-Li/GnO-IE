Lipid peroxidation: This is a type of oxidative stress that occurs when lipids (fatty molecules) in the body are damaged by free radicals.\n3. Oxidized glutathione: Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect cells from oxidative damage. When glutathione is oxidized, it becomes less effective in protecting cells.\n4. Reduced glutathione: This refers to the reduced form of glutathione, which is the active form of the antioxidant.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hepatic tissue disease (Hepatitis)\n2. Lipid peroxidation disease\n3. Oxidized glutathione disease\n4. Reduced glutathione disease"},

Lipid peroxidation products: This refers to the byproducts of lipid oxidation, which can occur due to the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body. Lipid peroxidation can lead to the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which are common markers of oxidative stress.\n2. Glutathione: Glutathione is a tripeptide that acts as a powerful antioxidant in the body. It is involved in the detoxification of harmful substances, including ROS, and helps to maintain the balance of oxidation and reduction reactions in cells.\n\nSo, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Lipid peroxidation products (MDA and 4-HNE)\n2. Glutathione"},
