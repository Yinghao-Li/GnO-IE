Glucose: This is a simple sugar that is metabolized by the body and is the primary substrate for the glucose tolerance test.\n2. Atypical antipsychotic agents: These are a class of drugs used to treat schizophrenia, which are known to affect glucose metabolism. Examples of atypical antipsychotics include clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine.\n3. Insulin: This is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells.\n4. Glucose tolerance test: This is a medical test used to evaluate how well the body regulates blood sugar levels after consuming a sugary drink.\n5. Minimal model analysis: This is a statistical method used to analyze the data collected from the glucose tolerance test to estimate the body's insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.\n\nI hope this helps!
