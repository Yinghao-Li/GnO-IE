Cocaine naive (CN): This entity represents a state or condition of being free from cocaine use, which can be considered a disease or disorder due to the potential negative effects of cocaine on an individual's health and well-being.\n2. Occasional cocaine (OC): This entity represents a pattern of cocaine use that is less frequent or less intense than regular recreational cocaine use, but still has the potential to cause negative effects on an individual's health and well-being.\n3. Regular recreational cocaine (RC): This entity represents a pattern of cocaine use that is frequent or intense, and can be considered a disease or disorder due to the potential negative effects of cocaine on an individual's health and well-being.\n\nIt's important to note that these entities are not necessarily medical diagnoses, but rather categories of cocaine use based on the frequency and intensity of use."},
