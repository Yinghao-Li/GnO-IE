It refers to high blood sugar levels.\n2. Effect: This is a verb that describes the action or reaction of the disease entity (hyperglycemic) on the body. In this case, it refers to the impact of amino compounds structurally related to caproate on blood sugar levels in rats.\n3. Amino compounds: These are the substances being studied in the paragraph. They are made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.\n4. Structurally related to caproate: This phrase describes the relationship between the amino compounds and caproate, which is a specific amino acid.\n5. Rats: These are the animals being studied in the paragraph. The research is being conducted on rats to observe the effects of the amino compounds on their blood sugar levels.\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), and the other entities are related to the study of this disease in rats."},
