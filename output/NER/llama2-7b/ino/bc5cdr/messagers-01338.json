    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Peri - operative\" refers to the surgical procedure or condition surrounding the operation. In this case, it is likely referring to the atrioventricular block that is occurring as a result of the chemotherapy.\n2. \"Atrioventricular block\" is a type of heart condition where the electrical signals that control the heart's rhythm are blocked or delayed, leading to abnormal heart rhythms.\n3. \"As a result of chemotherapy with epirubicin and paclitaxel\" indicates that the atrioventricular block is caused by the chemotherapy drugs epirubicin and paclitaxel.\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"atrioventricular block,\" which is caused by the chemotherapy drugs epirubicin and paclitaxel."},
