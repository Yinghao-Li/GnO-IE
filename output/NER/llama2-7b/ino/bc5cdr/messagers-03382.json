Confounding: This entity represents the factors that can influence the observed associations in the study. It can be considered a disease entity because it can lead to inaccurate conclusions if not properly controlled for.\n3. Temporal aspects: This entity represents the study's focus on the temporal aspects of the associations observed. It is not a disease entity in itself, but rather a aspect of the study that aims to understand the timing of the associations.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
