Cephalothin: This is a type of antibiotic, so it could be considered a disease entity in the sense that it is a substance that can cause an immune response in the body.\n2. IgG antibody: IgG is a type of antibody, which is a protein produced by the immune system in response to the presence of foreign substances (antigens). In this case, the IgG antibody is directed against cephalothin, indicating that the patient's immune system is responding to the antibiotic.\n3. Erythrocytes: Erythrocytes are red blood cells, which are responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. In this context, the eluates from the erythrocytes are likely referring to the cells themselves, rather than a disease entity.\n\nSo, in summary, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cephalothin (as an antibiotic)\n2. IgG antibody (as a protein produced in response to an antigen)\n3. Erythrocytes (as a type of red blood cell)"},
