Caesarean section (a surgical procedure)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Warfarin is an anticoagulant drug that can cause bleeding or hemorrhage if taken in excessive amounts. Replacing warfarin with heparin in this context suggests that the patient was experiencing bleeding or coagulopathy due to warfarin overdose or poisoning.\n2. Heparin is another anticoagulant drug that can cause bleeding or hemorrhage if taken in excessive amounts. Replacing warfarin with heparin in this context suggests that the patient was experiencing bleeding or coagulopathy due to heparin overdose or poisoning.\n3. Caesarean section is a surgical procedure used to deliver a baby through an incision in the abdomen and uterus. It is not a disease entity, but rather a medical procedure that is performed in certain medical conditions, such as when a vaginal delivery is not possible or safe.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities present in the paragraph are Warfarin poisoning or overdose and Heparin overdose or poisoning."},
