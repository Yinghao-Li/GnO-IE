To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Growth\" - This is not a disease entity, but rather a normal physiological process.\n2. \"associated protein 43 expression\" - This is a disease entity, as it is a protein that is associated with a particular disease or condition.\n3. \"hippocampal molecular layer\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific region of the brain that is affected by certain diseases or conditions.\n4. \"chronic epileptic rats\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific type of animal model that is used to study epilepsy.\n5. \"treated with cycloheximide\" - This is not a disease entity, but rather a treatment or intervention that is used to study the effects of the disease entities mentioned above.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"associated protein 43 expression\"\n* \"hippocampal molecular layer\"\n* \"chronic epileptic rats\""},
