To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down into smaller parts and analyze each part:\n\n1. \"Patients in the hypercalcemic group\" - This refers to a specific group of patients who have high levels of calcium in their blood, which is the primary indicator of the disease.\n2. \"exhibited a significant increase in the mean calcium concentration\" - This sentence describes the characteristic symptom of the disease, which is an increase in calcium levels in the blood.\n3. \"obtained during 6 months before the switch\" - This refers to the time period before the patients were treated for the disease.\n4. \"compared with the mean value obtained during the 7 months of observation after the switch\" - This sentence compares the calcium levels before and after treatment.\n\nBased on these clues, we can identify the \"disease\" entity in the paragraph as \"hypercalcemia,\" which is a medical condition characterized by high levels of calcium in the blood."},
