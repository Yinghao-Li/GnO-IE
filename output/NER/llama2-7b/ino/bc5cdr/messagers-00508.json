Brain disease: The paragraph mentions \"normal rats\" and \"complete staining with TTC,\" which suggests that the study is focused on examining the brain tissue of healthy rats. The absence of any abnormalities or diseased conditions in the brain tissue of these rats implies that they are free from brain diseases.\n2. Neurodegenerative disease: The use of TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining suggests that the study is focused on examining the structure and integrity of brain tissue, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. TTC staining can help identify areas of cellular death and necrosis, which are common features of these diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"Brain disease\" and \"Neurodegenerative disease.\""},
