To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"In rhesus monkeys\" - This phrase indicates that the study was conducted on rhesus monkeys, which are a type of primate.\n2. \"intravenous challenge with 0.6 x 10^10 to 2.2 x 10^10 Pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms\" - This sentence describes the method used to challenge the rhesus monkeys with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of bacteria. The numbers provided indicate the range of bacterial doses used in the study.\n3. \"caused acute illness of 4 to 5 days' duration with spontaneous recovery in 13 of 15 monkeys\" - This sentence reports the outcome of the challenge, indicating that the bacterial challenge caused acute illness in the monkeys, which lasted for 4-5 days in most cases, but some monkeys recovered spontaneously.\n4. \"blood cultures became negative 3 to 17 days after challenge\" - This sentence reports the outcome of blood cultures taken from the monkeys after the challenge, indicating that the bacteria were cleared from the bloodstream within 3-17 days.\n\nBased on these clues, we can identify the disease entity in the paragraph as \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection\" or \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis\"."},
