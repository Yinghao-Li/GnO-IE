It refers to a type of swelling that occurs in the skin and other tissues, typically due to an allergic reaction or other immune-mediated process.\n2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor: This is the medication that the two patients were taking, which is associated with the development of angio-oedema.\n3. Long-term therapy: This refers to the duration of time that the patients were taking the ACE inhibitor, which is the factor that increases the risk of developing angio-oedema.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Angio-oedema\n2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor\n3. Long-term therapy"},
