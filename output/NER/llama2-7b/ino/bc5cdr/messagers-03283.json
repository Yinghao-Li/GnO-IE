Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, referring to a condition where there is a deficiency or mutation in the BCHE gene that codes for butyrylcholinesterase.\n2. Apnea: This is a medical condition where a person stops breathing for a period of time.\n3. Muscle relaxants: These are drugs that are used to relax muscles, such as suxamethonium or mivacurium.\n4. BCHE gene: This is the gene that codes for butyrylcholinesterase, which is the enzyme that is deficient or mutated in butyrylcholinesterase deficiency."},

Mivacurium: a muscle relaxant\n3. Butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE): an enzyme involved in the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Suxamethonium and mivacurium are both chemical substances used as muscle relaxants in medical procedures. They work by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, resulting in muscle relaxation.\n2. Butyrylcholinesterase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in muscle contraction and relaxation. Mutations in the BCHE gene can lead to prolonged apnea (pauses in breathing) after the use of muscle relaxants like suxamethonium or mivacurium."},
