To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Skin tests\" - This is a type of medical test that is used to diagnose allergies or sensitivities to certain substances.\n2. \"Lymphocyte stimulation\" - This refers to a laboratory test that measures the body's immune response to a particular substance by stimulating the production of white blood cells called lymphocytes.\n3. \"Patient\" - This refers to the individual who is being tested for allergies or sensitivities.\n4. \"Cephalothin\" - This is a type of antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial infections.\n5. \"Ampicillin\" - This is another type of antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial infections.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Allergies or sensitivities to cephalothin and ampicillin, which are the substances being tested for in the skin tests and lymphocyte stimulation.\n\nI hope this helps!
