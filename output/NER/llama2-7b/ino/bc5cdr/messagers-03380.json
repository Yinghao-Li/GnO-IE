Identify the keywords:\n * Parkinson's disease\n * ozone\n * fine particulate matter\n2. Check for proper nouns:\n * North Carolina\n * Iowa\n3. Identify the entities mentioned in the context:\n * disease (Parkinson's disease)\n * environmental factor (ozone, fine particulate matter)\n4. Check for any additional information:\n * The paragraph mentions that the study was conducted in two states, North Carolina and Iowa, which suggests that the disease entity is related to a specific geographic location.\n\nBased on these steps, we can identify the disease entity in the paragraph as \"Parkinson's disease\"."},
