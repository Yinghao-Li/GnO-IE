Endothelium: The endothelium is the inner lining of blood vessels, and \"endothelium-derived relaxing factor\" (EDRF) refers to a substance produced by the endothelium that helps to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow.\n2. Nitric oxide (NO): Nitric oxide is a signaling molecule that is produced by various cells in the body, including endothelial cells, and plays a role in relaxing blood vessels and improving blood flow.\n3. Peptide-produced hypotension: This refers to a condition in which blood pressure is lower than normal, caused by the production of certain peptides (small protein-like molecules).\n\nSo, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Endothelial dysfunction (related to the endothelium and EDRF)\n2. Nitric oxide deficiency (related to the production of nitric oxide)\n3. Peptide-produced hypotension (a specific condition caused by the production of certain peptides)"},

Nitric oxide (NO): This is a small molecule that acts as a signaling molecule in the body.
