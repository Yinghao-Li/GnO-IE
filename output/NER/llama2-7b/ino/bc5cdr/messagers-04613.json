Torsades de pointes: This is a type of abnormal heart rhythm, specifically a ventricular tachycardia with a slowed ventricular rate and a specific pattern of QRS complexes on the electrocardiogram (ECG).\n2. Sinus cycle length (SCL): This refers to the normal length of time it takes for the heart to complete one complete cycle of contraction and relaxation.\n3. QT interval: This refers to the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat.\n4. U wave: This refers to a specific type of waveform on the ECG that is associated with the repolarization of the ventricles.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
