Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is \"sulfadiazine acute nephrotoxicity.\"\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Sulfadiazine: This is a medication or drug that can cause nephrotoxicity.\n * Nephrotoxicity: This is a type of toxicity that affects the kidneys.\n * Disease: Acute nephrotoxicity is a disease or condition that affects the kidneys.\n3. Identify the relationships between the entities:\n * Sulfadiazine causes nephrotoxicity.\n * Nephrotoxicity is a type of toxicity that affects the kidneys.\n * Acute nephrotoxicity is a disease or condition that affects the kidneys.\n4. Identify any other relevant entities:\n * Kidneys: The paragraph mentions \"kidneys,\" which are the organs affected by nephrotoxicity.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Acute nephrotoxicity\n\nI hope this helps!
