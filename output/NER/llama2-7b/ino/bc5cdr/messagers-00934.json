Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is \"immunohistochemical studies\" or \"staining\".\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph: The entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n * \"results\"\n * \"staining\"\n * \"immunohistochemical studies\"\n3. Determine whether each entity is a disease or not:\n * \"results\" is not a disease, it's a noun referring to the outcome of the study.\n * \"staining\" is not a disease, it's a noun referring to the process of using dyes to detect specific proteins in tissues.\n * \"immunohistochemical studies\" is not a disease, it's a noun referring to a type of laboratory test.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"immunohistochemical studies\"."},
