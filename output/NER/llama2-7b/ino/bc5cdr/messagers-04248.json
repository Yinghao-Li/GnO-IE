Cirrhotic patients: This is a disease entity, specifically a type of liver disease characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the liver.\n2. Compensated cirrhotic patients: This is a subtype of cirrhotic patients, which refers to a stage of liver disease where the liver is able to compensate for its impaired function by increasing the production of blood vessels.\n3. Indomethacin: This is a medication, specifically a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain, inflammation, and fever.\n4. Misoprostol: This is also a medication, specifically a prostaglandin that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including ulcers, inflammation, and gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cirrhotic patients\n2. Compensated cirrhotic patients\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph are medications (indomethacin and misoprostol) that are used to treat various conditions."},
