Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Patients\n * dyskinesia\n * levodopa therapy\n * disease duration\n * total daily levodopa dose\n * total UPDRS scores\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Patients: disease\n * dyskinesia: disorder\n * levodopa therapy: treatment\n * disease duration: time\n * total daily levodopa dose: medication\n * total UPDRS scores: assessment\n3. Identify the relationships between the nouns:\n * Patients have dyskinesia (relationship: has)\n * Dyskinesia is associated with lower onset age, longer duration of levodopa therapy, longer disease duration, higher total daily levodopa dose, and higher total UPDRS scores (relationship: associated with)\n4. Identify the disease entities in the paragraph:\n * dyskinesia (disorder)\n * Parkinson's disease (disease)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"dyskinesia\" and \"Parkinson's disease\"."},
