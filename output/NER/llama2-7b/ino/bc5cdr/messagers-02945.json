Hyperalgesia: This refers to an increased sensitivity to pain, where a person experiences more pain than the normal amount in response to a stimulus.\n2. Allodynia: This refers to a type of pain that is not typically associated with injury or inflammation, but is instead caused by a variety of other factors, such as nerve damage or neurological disorders. In this context, allodynia refers to the experience of pain from non-tactile stimuli, such as light touch or temperature changes.\n\nSo, in summary, the two \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are hyperalgesia and allodynia, which are both related to pain disorders."},
