Fulminant eosinophilic myocarditis: This is a type of inflammatory heart disease characterized by a sudden and severe inflammation of the heart muscle, leading to severe damage and dysfunction.\n2. Carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity: This refers to an allergic reaction to the medication carbamazepine, which can cause a range of symptoms including skin rash, itching, and difficulty breathing.\n3. Drug hypersensitivity: This term refers to an abnormal reaction to a medication, which can cause a range of symptoms including skin rash, itching, and difficulty breathing.\n4.
