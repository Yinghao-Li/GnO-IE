Insulin resistance: This is a condition where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. Insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes.\n2. Impairment of glucose effectiveness: This refers to the inability of the body to use glucose effectively, which can also contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.\n3. Type 2 diabetes: This is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin secretion.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are insulin resistance, impairment of glucose effectiveness, and type 2 diabetes."},
