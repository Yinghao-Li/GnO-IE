Developmental toxicity\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"Dermal exposure\" refers to the exposure of the skin to a substance, in this case, S-53482.\n2. \"Developmental toxicity\" refers to the toxic effects of a substance on the development of an organism, particularly during fetal development or early childhood. In this case, the exposure of rats to S-53482 resulted in developmental toxicity patterns similar to those resulting from oral exposure."},
