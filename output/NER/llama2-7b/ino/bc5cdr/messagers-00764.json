To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Thrombophlebitis\" is the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It refers to the inflammation of a vein caused by a blood clot.\n2. \"High incidence\" is a quantitative attribute of the disease entity \"Thrombophlebitis\". It indicates the frequency or proportion of individuals experiencing the disease.\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"Thrombophlebitis\"."},
