However, based on the context, we can identify the following potential disease entities:\n\n1. Kidney disease: The paragraph mentions the examination of the other kidney, which suggests that the patient may have had a kidney-related condition.\n2. Nephritis: The term \"nephritis\" refers to inflammation of the kidneys, which can be caused by various diseases, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and toxicity.\n3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): CKD is a broader term that refers to the gradual loss of kidney function over time, often caused by diabetes, high blood pressure, or other underlying conditions.\n4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): AKI refers to sudden and temporary loss of kidney function, which can be caused by various factors, such as severe dehydration, medication side effects, or sepsis.\n\nTherefore, the potential disease entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Kidney disease\n2. Nephritis\n3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD)\n4. Acute kidney injury (AKI)"},
