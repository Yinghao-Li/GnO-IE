MHC - CB7: This is a genetic disease caused by the expression of a dominant-interfering p53 gene in cardiomyocytes.\n2. DOX: This is the drug used in the experiment, which is a type of chemotherapy drug that can cause cardiotoxicity and damage to the heart muscle.\n3. Cardiomyocytes: These are the cells of the heart muscle that are affected by the disease.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are MHC - CB7, which is a genetic disease that affects the heart muscle, and DOX, which is a chemotherapy drug that can cause cardiotoxicity."},
