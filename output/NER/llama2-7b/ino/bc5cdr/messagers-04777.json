Bile duct diversion: This is a surgical procedure that involves redirecting the flow of bile from the liver to another part of the body, typically to treat bile duct cancer or other bile duct disorders.\n2. Biliary BS (bile synthesis): Biliary BS refers to the synthesis and secretion of bile by the liver. Bile is a digestive fluid produced by the liver that helps break down fats and absorbs fat-soluble vitamins.\n3. BS (bile synthesis): BS is a broader term that refers to the overall process of bile synthesis and secretion by the liver.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Bile duct diversion\n2. Biliary BS (bile synthesis)"},

Let's break down the entities in the paragraph one by one:\n\n1. \"BS\" - This stands for \"bile salt.\"\n2. \"E\" - This could stand for several things, but based on the context, it is likely that it stands for \"Ethinyl estradiol,\" which is a synthetic estrogen used in hormone replacement therapy.\n3. \"rats\" - This refers to the animals used in the study, which are rats.\n4. \"bile\" - This refers to the digestive fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder.\n5. \"diverted\" - This adjective modifies the noun \"rats\" and means that the rats in the study had their bile diverted or redirected in some way.\n6. \"treated\" - This verb modifies the noun \"rats\" and means that the rats were given something (in this case, EE) to influence their bile composition.\n7. \"biliary\" - This adjective modifies the noun \"BS\" and refers to the bile composition.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* BS (bile salt)\n* EE (Ethinyl estradiol)\n\nI hope this helps!
