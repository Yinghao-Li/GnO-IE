Plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) - This is a blood test that measures the level of urea nitrogen in the blood. Elevated levels of BUN can indicate kidney dysfunction or disease.\n2. Creatinine - This is another blood test that measures the level of creatinine in the blood. Creatinine is a waste product that is produced by the muscles and is excreted by the kidneys. Elevated levels of creatinine in the blood can indicate kidney dysfunction or disease.\n3. Intravenous contrast material - This is a substance that is injected into a vein to help visualize internal organs or tissues during medical imaging procedures such as CT scans or MRIs. The administration of intravenous contrast material can sometimes cause adverse reactions, such as allergic reactions or kidney damage.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are kidney dysfunction or disease, which can be caused by the administration of intravenous contrast material."},
