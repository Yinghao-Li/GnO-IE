However, the next sentence \"Let's think step by step\" suggests that the speaker is about to discuss a specific disease.\n* The term \"Disease\" is used in the second sentence, which suggests that the speaker is referring to a specific medical condition.\n* The context of the paragraph suggests that the speaker is discussing cancer, as the next sentence mentions \"three major results\" related to cancer. Therefore, the entity \"Cancer\" can be identified as the disease entity in the paragraph."},
