In this paragraph, the following \"disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. \"Disease\" (mentioned as \"patient\" in the paragraph) - This refers to the individual who is suffering from the undiagnosed condition.\n2. \"Proband\" - This is a term used in genetics to refer to an individual who is being tested for a genetic disorder. In this paragraph, the proband is the individual who is being tested for a reduced amount of tetrameric BChE in their plasma.\n3. \"Mother\" - This is the individual who is related to the proband and is mentioned in the paragraph as the proband's mother.\n4. \"BChE\" - This stands for \"butyrylcholinesterase,\" which is an enzyme that is involved in the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the body.\n5. \"Tetrameric BChE\" - This refers to the normal, fully functional form of the BChE enzyme, which exists as a tetramer (a complex of four subunits).\n6. \"Fast-moving BChE components\" - This refers to the different forms of the BChE enzyme that are present in the plasma of the proband, including the monomer, dimer, and monomer-albumin conjugate forms. These forms are missing in the proband's plasma.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
