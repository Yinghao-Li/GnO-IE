It refers to an abnormal increase in the levels of prolactin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland.\n2. Dopaminergic systems: This refers to the system in the brain that produces and regulates the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine plays a crucial role in motivation, pleasure, and reward processing, among other functions.\n\nSo, the paragraph is discussing the effects of inducing hyperprolactinemia (an abnormal increase in prolactin levels) on the dopaminergic systems in the brain."},
