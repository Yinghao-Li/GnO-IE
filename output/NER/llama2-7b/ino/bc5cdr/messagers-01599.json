To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"YMDD motif mutants\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific genetic mutation that is associated with a particular disease.\n2. \"patients\" - This is also a disease entity, as it refers to individuals who are suffering from a particular illness or condition.\n3. \"liver enzyme levels\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific measure of a patient's liver function.\n4. \"HBeAg\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific protein that is associated with the hepatitis B virus.\n5. \"anti-HBe\" - This is also a disease entity, as it refers to an antibody that is produced in response to the hepatitis B virus.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* YMDD motif mutants\n* patients\n* liver enzyme levels\n* HBeAg\n* anti-HBe"},
