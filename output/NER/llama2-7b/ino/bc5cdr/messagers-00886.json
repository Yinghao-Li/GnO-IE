Reverse transcriptase inhibitor: This is a type of drug that inhibits the reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA, which is a crucial step in the replication of many viruses.\n2. 2',3' dideoxyinosine: This is a nucleoside, a type of molecule that is composed of a sugar molecule and a nitrogenous base. In this case, the nitrogenous base is inosine, which is a purine base found in RNA. The 2',3' position refers to the position of the base on the sugar molecule.\n\nSo, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
