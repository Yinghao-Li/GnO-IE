Poorly characterized disease\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Neurotoxicity refers to the toxic effects of a substance on the nervous system. In this context, the paragraph is mentioning that Busulfan is known to be neurotoxic in animals and humans.\n2. Acute neurotoxicity refers to the sudden and severe effects of a substance on the nervous system, often resulting in immediate harm or damage. In this context, the paragraph is mentioning that the acute neurotoxicity of Busulfan in children remains poorly characterized.\n3. Poorly characterized disease refers to a disease or condition that is not well understood or characterized, often due to a lack of research or data. In this context, the paragraph is mentioning that the acute neurotoxicity of Busulfan in children is poorly characterized, indicating that there is a need for more research to fully understand the effects of the drug on the nervous system in this population."},
