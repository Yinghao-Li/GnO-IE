Morphine addiction: The paragraph mentions the effects of morphine on conditioned place preference and biphasic changes in motor activity, which are indicative of morphine addiction.\n2. Potassium (K+) channel blockade: The paragraph mentions the use of two unselective potassium channel blockers, quinine and 4-aminopyridine, which can have effects on the nervous system and may be used to treat various diseases, including epilepsy and migraines.\n\nI hope this helps!
