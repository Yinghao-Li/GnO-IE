To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"thalidomide\" - This is a drug, so it is not a disease entity.\n2. \"peripheral neuropathy\" - This is a disease entity. It refers to a group of symptoms and signs that affect the peripheral nervous system, including numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain in the hands and feet.\n3. \"subclinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy\" - This is a disease entity. It refers to the presence of subtle signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy that are not yet clinically apparent.\n4. \"before treatment\" - This is a time point, not a disease entity.\n5. \"at repeat testing\" - This is a time point, not a disease entity.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Peripheral neuropathy\n* Subclinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy"},
