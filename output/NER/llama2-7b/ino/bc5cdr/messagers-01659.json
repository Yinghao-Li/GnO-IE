Ethical approval - This is a formal approval given by an ethics committee to conduct a study or experiment, typically to ensure that it meets ethical standards and does not harm participants.\n2. Anesthetic - This is a chemical substance used to induce a temporary loss of sensation or consciousness, typically during medical procedures.\n3. ASA - This stands for American Society of Anesthesiologists, which is a professional organization of anesthesiologists.\n4. Physical status class - This is a classification system used to describe a patient's overall physical health and fitness for surgery, based on factors such as age, weight, and other medical conditions.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ethical approval\n2. Anesthetic\n\nNote that while \"ASA\" is not a chemical entity, it is a professional organization that deals with anesthesiology, and therefore it could be considered a \"Chemical\" entity in a broader sense, as it is related to the use of chemical substances in medical procedures."},
