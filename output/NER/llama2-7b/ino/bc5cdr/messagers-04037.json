Halothane: Halothane is a general anesthetic agent that is used for inducing anesthesia. It is a chemical compound that is administered through inhalation.\n2. Bradycardia: Bradycardia is a medical condition characterized by a slow heart rate. In this context, it is mentioned as a result of halothane anaesthesia, which suggests that halothane may have affected the heart's ability to function properly.\n3. Hypotension: Hypotension is a medical condition characterized by low blood pressure. In this context, it is mentioned as a result of halothane anaesthesia, which suggests that halothane may have affected the body's ability to regulate blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
