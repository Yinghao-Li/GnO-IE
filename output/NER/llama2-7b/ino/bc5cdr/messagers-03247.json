Double-blinded: This term refers to a study design in which neither the participants nor the researchers know which group the participants are assigned to. This is a chemical process in the sense that it involves the use of masking or concealing the identity of the groups to prevent bias.\n3. Study: This term refers to the overall research project, which is a chemical process in the sense that it involves the use of various methods and techniques to collect and analyze data.\n4. Patients: These are the individuals who are participating in the study, and they are the ones who are exposed to the chemical substances being studied.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
