Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n\n* Bone turnover rates\n* Groups\n2. Identify the noun phrases that refer to a disease or medical condition:\n\n* Bone turnover rates (this could refer to a disease or condition that affects bone metabolism)\n* Groups (this could refer to a group of patients with a specific disease or condition)\n3. Check if any of the noun phrases identify a specific disease or condition:\n\n* Bone turnover rates: This could refer to a variety of diseases or conditions that affect bone metabolism, such as osteoporosis, bone cancer, or Paget's disease.\n* Groups: This could refer to a group of patients with a specific disease or condition, such as a clinical trial group or a patient support group.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Bone turnover rates (which could refer to a variety of diseases or conditions)\n* Groups (which could refer to a group of patients with a specific disease or condition)"},
