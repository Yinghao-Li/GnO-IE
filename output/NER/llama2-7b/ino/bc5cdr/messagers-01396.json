It is a ganglionic blocker, which means it blocks the action of chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) in the nervous system.\n2. Arterial pressure: This is a physiological parameter that is affected by the action of trimethaphan. It refers to the pressure of blood in the arteries.\n3. Lesioned: This is a term used to describe a group of animals that have undergone a specific type of surgical procedure. In this case, the animals in the lesioned group have had a specific area of their nervous system damaged or removed.\n4. Sham: This is another term used to describe a group of animals that have undergone a specific type of surgical procedure, but in this case, the procedure is a mock or simulated procedure. The animals in the sham group have not actually undergone any surgery.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
