Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is \"therapy\" or \"treatment\".\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph: The entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n * Patients (44)\n * Objective evidence (of an antineoplastic effect)\n * Subjective evidence (of an antineoplastic effect)\n3. Determine the type of entity: Based on the context, we can determine that \"Patients\" and \"Objective evidence\" are both \"Disease\" entities, as they are related to the treatment of a disease. \"Subjective evidence\" is also a \"Disease\" entity, as it refers to the patient's subjective experience of the treatment's effectiveness.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Patients (Disease)\n* Objective evidence (Disease)\n* Subjective evidence (Disease)\n\nI hope this helps!
