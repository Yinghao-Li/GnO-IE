To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Propranolol\" is a drug or medication that is being mentioned.\n2. \"antagonism\" is a term that refers to the interaction between two molecules, in this case, the drug propranolol and another molecule (which we will identify later).\n3. \"induced\" means that the hypertension (high blood pressure) is caused by something else, rather than being a natural condition.\n4. \"hypertension\" is the disease entity being referred to. It is a condition characterized by high blood pressure.\n5. \"phenylpropanolamine\" is another drug or medication that is being mentioned.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypertension (high blood pressure)\n* Phenylpropanolamine (a drug that can cause hypertension)"},
