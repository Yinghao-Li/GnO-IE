Microalbuminuria: The paragraph mentions \"microalbuminuria,\" which is the presence of small amounts of albumin in the urine, a common sign of kidney damage.\n4. Endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT): The paragraph highlights the role of EndoMT in the early development of renal interstitial fibrosis, which is a process where the endothelial cells in the kidneys undergo a transformation into mesenchymal cells, leading to the formation of scar tissue in the kidneys."},

Mesenchymal: This refers to a type of connective tissue that is composed of cells that are involved in the formation of scar tissue.\n3. Transition: This refers to the process of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), which is a cellular process where endothelial cells undergo a transformation to become mesenchymal cells.\n4. Microalbuminuria: This refers to the presence of small amounts of albumin in the urine, which is a common marker of kidney damage.\n5. Streptozotocin (STZ): This is a chemical compound that is used as a diabetes model in mice.
