To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Findings consistent with coronary artery disease\": This is the main disease entity being discussed in the paragraph. Coronary artery disease refers to the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle.\n2. \"were detected\": This is a verb form indicating that the disease entity was identified or detected in the patients or controls.\n3. \"in 12 ( 34 % ) patients\": This is a number and a percentage that indicates the number of patients in which the disease entity was detected. In this case, 12 patients out of the total 35 patients (34%) had findings consistent with coronary artery disease.\n4. \"and 3 ( 9 % ) controls\": This is a number and a percentage that indicates the number of controls in which the disease entity was detected. In this case, 3 controls out of the total 35 controls (9%) had findings consistent with coronary artery disease.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Coronary artery disease\n\nI hope this helps!
