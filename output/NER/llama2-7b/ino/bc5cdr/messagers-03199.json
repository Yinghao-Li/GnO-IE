It is a medication used to treat high cholesterol.\n2. \"Muscle toxicity\" is a disease entity. It refers to any type of toxicity that affects the muscles, including muscle damage or muscle breakdown.\n3. \"Statin-induced muscle toxicity\" is a disease entity. It is a specific type of muscle toxicity that occurs as a side effect of taking statin medications, such as simvastatin.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Simvastatin\n* Muscle toxicity\n* Statin-induced muscle toxicity"},
