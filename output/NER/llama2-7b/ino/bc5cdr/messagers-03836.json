Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Systemic vascular resistance\n * PPA (Pharmacological Probe Agent)\n * Propranolol\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Systemic vascular resistance: resistance\n * PPA: agent\n * Propranolol: drug\n3. Identify the verbs in each noun phrase:\n * Systemic vascular resistance: increased\n * PPA: increased\n * Propranolol: increased\n4. Identify the adjectives in each noun phrase:\n * Systemic vascular resistance: by PPA\n * PPA: 28%\n * Propranolol: 22%\n5. Identify the entities in each noun phrase:\n * Systemic vascular resistance: resistance\n * PPA: PPA\n * Propranolol: propranolol\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Resistance\n* PPA\n* Propranolol\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nDisease entities: Resistance, PPA, Propranolol"},
