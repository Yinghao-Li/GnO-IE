Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n\n* It\n* was\n* well\n* tolerated\n* important\n* side\n* effects\n\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n\n* It: (no noun)\n* was: (no noun)\n* well: well (adjective)\n* tolerated: tolerated (adjective)\n* important: important (adjective)\n* side: side (noun)\n* effects: effects (noun)\n\n3.
