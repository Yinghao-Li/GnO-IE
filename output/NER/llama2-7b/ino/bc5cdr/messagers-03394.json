Dysplasia: This refers to abnormal development or growth of cells or tissues, often indicating a precancerous condition.\n2. Glomerulosclerosis: This is a condition where the glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, become scarred and hardened, leading to kidney damage and impaired function.\n3. Low functional programming: This refers to a decrease in the ability of the renal AT2R (angiotensin type 2 receptor) to function properly, which can lead to various kidney problems.\n\nSo, the three \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Dysplasia\n2. Glomerulosclerosis\n3. Low functional programming"},
