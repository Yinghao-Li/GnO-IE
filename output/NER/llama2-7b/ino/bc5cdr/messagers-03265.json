UT-A1: This is also a disease entity, which stands for urea transporter - aquaporin 1.\n3. WT: This is an abbreviation for wild-type, which refers to an organism that has a normal or unaltered genetic makeup.\n4. PKCa: This is an abbreviation for protein kinase C alpha, which is a protein that plays a role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways.\n5. KO: This is an abbreviation for knockout, which refers to an organism that has been genetically modified to lack a specific gene or protein.\n\nSo, in the paragraph, we can identify the following disease entities:\n\n* AQP2 (aquaporin 2)\n* UT-A1 (urea transporter - aquaporin 1)\n\nI hope this helps!
