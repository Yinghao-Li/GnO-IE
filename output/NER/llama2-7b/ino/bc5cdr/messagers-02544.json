HIT II (Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome type II)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. HIT: Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a rare but serious disease that can cause kidney failure, anemia, and bleeding. It is caused by genetic mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in blood clotting.\n2. HIT II: Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome type II (HIT II) is a subtype of HUS that is caused by a specific genetic mutation in the factor H gene. This mutation leads to the production of a defective protein that can cause blood clots to form in small blood vessels throughout the body, including the kidneys, brain, and other organs.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, the entities \"HIT\" and \"HIT II\" refer to the disease entities Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome type II, respectively."},
