Myocardial infarction: This refers to a heart attack or damage to the heart muscle due to a lack of blood supply.\n2. Chronic pre-treatment: This refers to a long-term treatment or exposure to a substance before a specific event or condition occurs.\n3. Cardiac dysfunction: This refers to abnormal or impaired functioning of the heart muscle or cardiovascular system.\n4. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4): This is a type of receptor found on the surface of immune cells that plays a role in recognizing and responding to bacterial infections.\n5. AMPK: This stands for Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase, which is an enzyme that plays a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism and responding to changes in energy levels.\n\nI hope this helps!
