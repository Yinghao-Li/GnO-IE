Myoclonus - a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary muscle jerks or twitches.\n2. Neurodegenerative disorders (Group NP) - a group of diseases that affect the brain and spinal cord, leading to progressive loss of neural function. Examples include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.\n3. Fibromyalgia (Group F) - a chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread muscle pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.\n4. Multiple sclerosis (Group M) - an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, leading to communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body.\n5. Functional movement disorders (Group FM) - a group of disorders that affect movement, including tremors, tics, and other movement abnormalities. Examples include dystonia, Tourette's syndrome, and restless leg syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the entities identified as \"Disease\" in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myoclonus\n2.
