Anesthesia: This refers to the use of a chemical substance (usually a gas or liquid) to induce a state of unconsciousness or sedation, which is necessary for ocular manipulation during surgical procedures.\n2. Tumor: This refers to a abnormal growth of cells that can be benign or malignant, and can be treated with various chemical therapies.\n3.
