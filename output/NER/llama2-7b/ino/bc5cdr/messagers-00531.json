Adenosine receptors: This is a type of receptor found on the surface of cells that responds to the neurotransmitter adenosine.\n2. Cocaine: This is a drug that is known to interact with adenosine receptors and can have various effects on the body, including addiction and cardiovascular problems.\n3. Agonists: These are substances that activate or mimic the action of a neurotransmitter at a receptor. In this case, agonists of A1 receptors are substances that activate the A1 adenosine receptor.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cocaine addiction\n2. Cardiovascular problems\n\nThese are the diseases that can be associated with the interaction of cocaine with adenosine receptors, as mentioned in the paragraph."},
