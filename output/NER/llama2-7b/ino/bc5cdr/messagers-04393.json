Identify the keywords:\n * \"lymphomas\"\n * \"high-dose Ara-C\"\n * \"strikingly similar syndrome\"\n2. Determine the context:\n * The paragraph mentions that four out of 23 patients were treated with high-dose Ara-C for lymphomas in the institution.\n * The syndrome developed during the perfusion of these patients.\n3. Identify the disease entities:\n * Based on the context, we can identify the following disease entities:\n  + Lymphoma: A type of cancer that affects the immune system, particularly the lymphatic system.\n  + Ara-C: A chemotherapy drug used to treat lymphoma and other types of cancer.\n  + Perfusion: The process of administering a drug or other substance through a fluid or gas.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Lymphoma\n* Ara-C\n* Perfusion"},
