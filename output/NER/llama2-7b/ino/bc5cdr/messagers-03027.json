Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): This is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including the immune system and the development of the brain.\n2. Amphetamine: This is a synthetic drug that is commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It works by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, which can help to improve focus and attention.\n3. Schizophrenia: This is a mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and a lack of motivation or interest in activities. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and there is no known cure.\n4. Mice: These are small rodents that are often used in scientific research to study various biological processes, including the effects of drugs on the brain and body.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are DHEA, amphetamine, and schizophrenia."},
