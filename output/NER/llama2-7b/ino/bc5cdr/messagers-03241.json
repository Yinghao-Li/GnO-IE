Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * Adverse events\n * intraocular pressure\n * cataract formation\n2. Check if any of the nouns are disease entities:\n * Intraocular pressure (yes, it is a disease entity)\n * Cataract formation (yes, it is a disease entity)\n3. Verify the disease entities:\n * Intraocular pressure: a condition characterized by an abnormal increase in the pressure within the eye, which can lead to vision loss and other complications.\n * Cataract formation: a clouding of the lens in the eye that can impair vision and blindness.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Intraocular pressure\n* Cataract formation"},
