Left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF): This refers to a decrease in the function of the left ventricle, which is the main chamber of the heart that pumps blood out of the heart and into the body.\n2. Heart failure (HF): This refers to a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n3. Arrhythmia (FS): This refers to abnormal heart rhythms, which can be too fast, too slow, or irregular.\n4. Cardiac remodeling (LVdP/dt): This refers to changes in the shape and size of the left ventricle, which can occur in response to heart failure or other conditions.\n5. Myocardial infarction (MBP): This refers to damage to the muscle tissue of the heart, which can occur due to a lack of blood flow or other factors.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},

Arrhythmia (FS)\n\nI removed the following entities that do not clearly refer to disease:\n\n1. Left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF) - although this term could refer to a disease, it is also a measure of the function of the left ventricle, which is not necessarily a disease in and of itself.\n2. Cardiac remodeling (LVdP/dt) - this term refers to changes in the shape and size of the left ventricle, which can occur in response to various conditions, including disease.\n3. Myocardial infarction (MBP) - this term refers to damage to the muscle tissue of the heart, which can occur due to a lack of blood flow or other factors, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph as a disease entity."},
