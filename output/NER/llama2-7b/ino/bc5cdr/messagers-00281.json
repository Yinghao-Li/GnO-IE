EADs: EADs stands for \"Electrolyte Abnormalities\", which is a chemical imbalance in the body's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, sodium, and chloride ions.\n4. QT prolongation: QT prolongation refers to a chemical change in the heart's electrical activity, specifically an increase in the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize (or recover) after each heartbeat. This can be caused by various chemical substances, including some medications, and can lead to irregular heart rhythms.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are dl-sotalol, azimilide, EADs, and QT prolongation."},
