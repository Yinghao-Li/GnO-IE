Autosomal: This refers to a genetic disorder that is located on one of the non-sex chromosomes (chromosomes 1-22).\n2. Recessive: This refers to a genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in a gene that is inherited from both parents. The mutation is recessive, meaning that the individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) in order to express the disease.\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"Recessive autosomal form\"."},
