Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Oral galactose\n * Rat age\n * Galactose dose\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Oral galactose: galactose\n * Rat age: age\n * Galactose dose: dose\n3. Identify any adjectives that modify the nouns:\n * Independent (modifying the verb \"was\")\n4. Identify any prepositional phrases that modify the nouns:\n * Of the rat age\n * Of the galactose dose\n5. Identify any disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * None mentioned directly\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that there are no \"Disease\" entities mentioned directly in the paragraph. The paragraph only mentions the beneficial effect of oral galactose on rats of different ages and at different doses, without mentioning any specific diseases."},
