Polypeptide\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Ventricular refers to the ventricles, which are chambers in the heart that pump blood out of the heart and into the circulatory system.\n2. Vasoactive refers to a substance that affects the muscles in the walls of blood vessels, causing them to relax or constrict.\n3. Intelligent is not a chemical entity, but rather a word that is used in the context of the sentence to describe the peptide.\n4. Polypeptide is a chemical entity that refers to a long, unbranched chain of amino acids. In the context of the sentence, it refers to the peptide that is produced in the heart and brain.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Ventricular\n* Vasoactive\n* Polypeptide"},
