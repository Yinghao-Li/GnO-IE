    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"hilar ectopic granule cell population\" - This is a type of cell population in the brain. \"Hilar\" refers to the location of these cells in the hippocampus, near the hilus. \"Ectopic\" means that these cells are located outside of their normal position. \"Granule cells\" are a type of neuron that are found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.\n2. \"increase in volume of the hilus\" - The hilus is a structure in the hippocampus that is involved in the formation and retrieval of memories. The volume of the hilus refers to its size.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hilar ectopic granule cells (a type of cell)\n* Volume of the hilus (a measure of the size of a structure)"},
