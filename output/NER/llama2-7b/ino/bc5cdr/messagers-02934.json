To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Hannover Wistar rats\" - This is a type of rat strain, not a disease entity.\n2. \"DOX\" - This is a chemical substance, not a disease entity.\n3. \"weekly\" - This is a unit of time, not a disease entity.\n4. \"8 weeks\" - This is a duration of time, not a disease entity.\n5. \"4 week off-dosing \"recovery\" period\" - This is a duration of time during which the rats were not exposed to the chemical substance, and it could be interpreted as a \"recovery\" period from a disease or toxicity caused by the substance.\n\nTherefore, the only \"disease\" entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"DOX toxicity\" or \"DOX-induced disease\"."},
