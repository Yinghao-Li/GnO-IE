Oxidative stress: This is a condition in which there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Oxidative stress can lead to cellular damage and contribute to the development of various diseases, including hypertension.\n2. Hypertension: This is a condition in which blood pressure is elevated. Hypertension can increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.\n3. Dex: This is likely a abbreviation for the drug dexamethasone, which is a synthetic glucocorticoid that is commonly used to treat inflammation and immune-related disorders.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are oxidative stress, hypertension, and dexamethasone (Dex) administration."},
