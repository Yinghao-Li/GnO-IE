Hypertension: The paragraph mentions that PPA (phenylephrine) increases blood pressure, which is a symptom of hypertension.\n2. Cardiovascular disease: The paragraph also mentions that PPA increases systemic vascular resistance, which can lead to cardiovascular disease.\n3. Heart disease: The paragraph mentions that propranolol (a medication) antagonizes the increase in cardiac output caused by PPA, which suggests that propranolol is used to treat heart disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypertension\n2. Cardiovascular disease\n3. Heart disease"},
