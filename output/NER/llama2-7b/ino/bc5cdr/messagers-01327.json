Early: This is a descriptive term that indicates the onset of the condition is early in the course of treatment with hydroxychloroquine.\n2. paracentral: This is an adjective that describes the location of the visual field loss. In this case, it means that the loss of vision occurs in the central part of the visual field, but not in the very center.\n3. visual field loss: This is the main disease entity being discussed in the paragraph. It refers to a loss of vision in the visual field, which can be caused by various conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, or neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Early\n* paracentral\n* visual field loss"},
