Rhabdomyolysis: This is the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph as a possible cause of raised cardiac biomarkers without any obvious cardiac issues. Rhabdomyolysis is a condition where the muscle tissue breaks down and releases muscle enzymes into the bloodstream, which can cause abnormalities in cardiac biomarkers.\n2. Cardiac issues: The paragraph mentions that the patient had raised cardiac biomarkers without any obvious cardiac issues. This suggests that the patient may have had some type of cardiac problem, but the biomarkers were elevated without any obvious cause.\n\nI hope this helps!
