L-DOPA: L-DOPA is a chemical compound that is used to treat Parkinson's disease. It is an L-type amino acid that is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps to replace the dopamine that is lost in Parkinson's disease.\n2. Potassium: The term \"hypokalemia\" in the paragraph refers to a decrease in the level of potassium in the blood. Potassium is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, including muscle contraction, heart function, and nerve function.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. L-DOPA\n2. Potassium (K+)"},
