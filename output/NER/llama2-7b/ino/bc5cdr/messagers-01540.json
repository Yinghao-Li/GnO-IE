To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Animals\" - This is a disease entity because it refers to living organisms that are affected by the drug.\n2. \"DOX\" - This is a disease entity because it is a drug that is being studied for its effects on the animals.\n3. \"HPMA copolymer conjugates\" - This is a disease entity because it refers to a specific type of drug delivery system that is being used to administer the drug DOX.\n4. \"Heart\" - This is a disease entity because it is an organ that is affected by the drug.\n5. \"Killed\" - This is a disease entity because it refers to the outcome of the study, which is that the animals died.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Animals\n* DOX\n* HPMA copolymer conjugates\n* Heart\n* Killed"},
