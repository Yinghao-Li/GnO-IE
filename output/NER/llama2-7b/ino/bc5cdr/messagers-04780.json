To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"mRNA levels\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the level of a specific type of molecule (mRNA) in the body.\n2. \"sterol 12alpha - hydroxylase\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of cholesterol.\n3. \"lithocholate 6beta - hydroxylase\" - This is also a disease entity, as it refers to another specific enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of cholesterol.\n4. \"bile diversion\" - This is not a disease entity, as it is a surgical procedure that is used to redirect the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder.\n5. \"EE\" - This is not a disease entity, as it is an abbreviation for \"exercise exercise\".\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"mRNA levels\"\n* \"sterol 12alpha - hydroxylase\"\n* \"lithocholate 6beta - hydroxylase\""},

Sterol: This is a type of lipid molecule that is synthesized in the liver and plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism.\n2. 12alpha-hydroxylase: This is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver.\n3. Lithocholate: This is a type of bile acid that is synthesized by the liver and stored in the gallbladder for release into the small intestine during digestion.\n4. EE (Epicatechin): This is a flavonoid compound that is found in cocoa and chocolate. It has been shown to have various biological activities, including the ability to inhibit the activity of certain enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Sterol\n* 12alpha-hydroxylase\n* Lithocholate\n* EE (Epicatechin)"},
