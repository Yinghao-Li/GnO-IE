To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Complete remission\" - This is a type of disease entity, as it refers to a state where the disease is completely gone.\n2. \"Partial remission\" - This is also a type of disease entity, as it refers to a state where the disease has improved but not completely gone.\n3. \"No change\" - This is not a disease entity, as it simply means that the disease has not changed or progressed.\n4. \"Progressive disease\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a state where the disease is getting worse.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Complete remission\n* Partial remission\n* Progressive disease"},

Complete remission (CR): This is a type of response to treatment, where the cancer has completely disappeared.\n2. Partial remission (PR): This is another type of response to treatment, where the cancer has shrunk but not completely disappeared.\n3. No change (NC): This refers to a situation where the cancer has not changed or progressed during treatment.\n4. Progressive disease (PD): This refers to a situation where the cancer has grown or spread during treatment.\n\nThese entities are all related to the treatment of cancer and the response of the cancer cells to different therapies, and can be considered as \"Chemical\" entities because they are related to the chemical properties and behavior of the cancer cells."},
