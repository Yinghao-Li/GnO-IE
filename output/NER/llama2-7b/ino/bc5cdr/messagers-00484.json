Cardiac death: The term \"cardiac death\" refers to the death of the heart muscle or the failure of the heart to function properly, which can be caused by various cardiovascular diseases.\n2. Significant coronary disease: The term \"significant coronary disease\" refers to the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. This can lead to chest pain or a heart attack if not treated promptly.\n\nThe other terms in the paragraph, such as \"CK-MB MI\" and \"total CK,\" are laboratory test results that are used to diagnose and monitor cardiovascular disease. These terms do not represent diseases in and of themselves, but rather measures of cardiac damage or dysfunction."},

MI (Myocardial Infarction)\n4. ng (Nanograms)\n5. mL (Milliliters)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. CK: Creatine Kinase is an enzyme that is present in muscle tissues, and its levels can be elevated in response to muscle damage or injury. In the context of the paragraph, CK is being used to measure the amount of muscle damage in the heart muscle.\n2. MB: Myocardial Band is not a commonly used term in medical literature, and it is unlikely that it refers to a specific chemical entity.\n3. MI: Myocardial Infarction, also known as a heart attack, is a medical condition where the blood supply to the heart muscle is blocked, resulting in damage to the heart tissue.\n4. ng: Nanograms is a unit of measurement used to express very small amounts of a substance, typically in the range of 10^-9 to 10^-6 grams.\n5. mL: Milliliters is a unit of volume measurement, commonly used to express the volume of liquids or gases.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are CK, MI, and ng."},
