    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Chemical\" entities:\n\n1. Concomitant: This is a chemical term that refers to the presence of something additional or accompanying something else. In this context, \"concomitant acute kidney injury\" refers to the presence of kidney damage occurring at the same time as another condition or event.\n2. Dialysis: This is a chemical term that refers to the process of removing waste products and excess fluids from the blood using a machine. In this context, \"intraoperative dialysis\" refers to the use of dialysis during surgery to remove waste products from the blood.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Concomitant\n2. Dialysis"},
