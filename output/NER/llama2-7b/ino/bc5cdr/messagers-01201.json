It is a central nervous system depressant and can affect the heart's electrical activity, which can lead to QT prolongation and increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation.\n2. QT interval: This is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. A prolonged QT interval can increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation.\n\nSo, the chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"methadone\", and the biological process or function mentioned is the effect of methadone on the QT interval."},
