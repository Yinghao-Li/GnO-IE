Nephrotoxicity: This refers to damage to the kidneys, which can be caused by various factors, including drugs like vancomycin.\n2. Oxidative stress: This is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Oxidative stress can lead to cellular damage and contribute to the development of various diseases.\n3. Vancomycin: This is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial infections. However, it can also cause nephrotoxicity in some individuals.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
