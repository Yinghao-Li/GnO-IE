Critical illness: The paragraph mentions that cimetidine produces a decrease in arterial pressure due to vasodilatation, especially in critically ill patients. Therefore, \"critical illness\" is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Vasodilatation: Vasodilatation is a physiological process that occurs in response to various stimuli, including the use of histamine 2 (H2) antagonists like cimetidine. Therefore, \"vasodilatation\" is also a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Critical illness\n2. Vasodilatation"},
