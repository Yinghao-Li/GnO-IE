Angiotensin system (a system composed of multiple chemical entities)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Renin: Renin is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the production of angiotensin. It is produced in the kidneys and helps to convert angiotensinogen into angiotensin I.\n2. Angiotensin: Angiotensin is a peptide hormone that is produced from the action of renin on angiotensinogen. It is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance in the body.\n3. Angiotensin system: The angiotensin system is a complex system that involves the conversion of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which is then converted into angiotensin II by the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that increases blood pressure by constricting blood vessels. The angiotensin system also includes other chemical entities such as angiotensin III and angiotensin IV, which have different functions and effects on the body.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are renin, angiotensin, and the angiotensin system."},
