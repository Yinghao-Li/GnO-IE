Jaw stiffness\n\nThe paragraph mentions that a \"marked jaw stiffness\" occurred, which lasted for two minutes. This can be interpreted as a medical condition or disease that affects the jaw.\n\n2. Anaesthesia\n\nThe paragraph also mentions that the anaesthesia was terminated. Anaesthesia is a medical treatment that is used to induce a temporary loss of sensation or consciousness, and it is not a disease or medical condition itself. However, in this context, it is possible that the termination of anaesthesia refers to the resolution of a medical condition or disease that required anaesthesia.\n\nTherefore, the two entities that can be identified as \"Disease\" or \"Medical Condition\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Jaw stiffness\n2. (Unspecified) disease or medical condition that required anaesthesia"},
