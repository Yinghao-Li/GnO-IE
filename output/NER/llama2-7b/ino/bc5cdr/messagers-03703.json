Codeine: Codeine is another drug that is used to treat pain, and it is also an opioid, like morphine.\n3. Fentanyl: Fentanyl is a powerful opioid that is used to treat severe pain, especially in patients who have developed tolerance to other opioids.\n4. Pentazocine: Pentazocine is a drug that is used to treat pain, and it is also an opioid.\n5. Catalepsy: Catalepsy is a condition in which a person experiences a sudden and temporary loss of muscle control, leading to rigidity and immobility.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Morphine\n* Codeine\n* Fentanyl\n* Pentazocine\n* Catalepsy"},
