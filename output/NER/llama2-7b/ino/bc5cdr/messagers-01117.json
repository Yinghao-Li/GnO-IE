Creatine phosphokinase (CPK): This is an enzyme found in muscle tissue that is involved in the production of energy. The high level of CPK in the blood (769 U/liter) indicates muscle damage or inflammation.\n3. Rhabdomyolysis: This is a type of muscle damage that can lead to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin is a protein found in muscle tissue that can cause kidney damage if it accumulates in the blood.\n4. Myoglobinuria: This is the presence of myoglobin in the urine, which can occur as a result of rhabdomyolysis.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Myositis\n* Creatine phosphokinase (CPK)\n* Rhabdomyolysis\n* Myoglobinuria"},
