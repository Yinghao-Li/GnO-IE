Cardiac ischemia\n\nExplanation: Cardiac ischemia refers to a condition where the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood, leading to damage or injury to the heart tissues.\n\n2. Ischemia\n\nExplanation: Ischemia is a general term that refers to a reduction in blood flow to a particular tissue or organ, which can lead to cellular damage and tissue death. In the context of the paragraph, \"ischemia\" is used specifically to refer to the reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle."},

Dobutamine: This is a chemical substance used as a medication to stimulate the heart and increase heart rate in patients undergoing stress echocardiography.\n2. Stress: This is a chemical substance that is used to stimulate the heart and cause physical stress on the cardiovascular system, allowing for the evaluation of cardiac ischemia.\n3.
