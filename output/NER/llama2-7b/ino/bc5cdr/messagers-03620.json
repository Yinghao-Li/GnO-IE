It is a type of chest pain that occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood.\n2. Coronary vasodilating properties: This refers to the ability of nisoldipine to widen (dilate) the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. This is a potential treatment for angina, as it can help increase blood flow to the heart muscle and reduce the symptoms of the disease."},
