Verapamil: This is a specific drug or medication that is used to treat various cardiovascular conditions, including high blood pressure, angina, and irregular heart rhythms.\n2. Diltiazem: Similar to verapamil, diltiazem is also a medication used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as high blood pressure, angina, and irregular heart rhythms.\n3. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: This is a class of drugs that includes verapamil and diltiazem. They are called \"calcium channel blockers\" because they work by blocking the flow of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells, which can help to relax the muscle and reduce blood pressure.\n4. Cardiac nodal or conduction tissue: This refers to the tissue in the heart that is responsible for conducting electrical signals that regulate the heart's rhythm.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Verapamil\n* Diltiazem\n* Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers\n* Cardiac nodal or conduction tissue"},
