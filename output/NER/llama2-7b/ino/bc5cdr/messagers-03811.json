Catalepsy: Catalepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by a sudden and involuntary rigidity of the muscles, often accompanied by a loss of movement and a stiff, immobile appearance.\n2. Dopaminergic blocker: Haloperidol is a dopaminergic blocker, which means it blocks the action of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in movement, motivation, and mood regulation.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, we have identified two disease entities: catalepsy and dopaminergic blocker."},
