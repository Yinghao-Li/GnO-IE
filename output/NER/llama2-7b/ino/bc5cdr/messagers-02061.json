Neurons - These are the cells that are being studied in the paragraph. The paragraph mentions the expression of CCR2 on neurons, which suggests that the study is focused on the neural system.\n\nExplanation: Neurons are the main cells of the nervous system, and their expression of CCR2 is being studied in the context of the disease or condition of Systemic Exsanguination.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. SE (Systemic Exsanguination)\n2. Neurons"},
