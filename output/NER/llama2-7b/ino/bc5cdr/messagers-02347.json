Menstrual abnormalities: This is a disease entity that refers to any abnormality in the menstrual cycle, such as irregular periods, heavy bleeding, or absence of periods.\n2. Weight gain: This is a disease entity that refers to an abnormal increase in body weight, which can be caused by various factors such as hormonal imbalances, metabolic disorders, or lifestyle factors.\n3. Muscle cramps / myalgias: This is a disease entity that refers to muscle pain or cramping, which can be caused by various factors such as muscle strain, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances.\n4. Transaminase elevations: This is a disease entity that refers to an abnormal increase in the levels of enzymes in the liver, which can be caused by various factors such as liver damage, liver disease, or certain medications.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Menstrual abnormalities\n* Weight gain\n* Muscle cramps / myalgias\n* Transaminase elevations"},

Menstrual abnormalities: This is a type of hormonal change that can occur in women, often related to changes in estrogen levels.\n2. Weight gain: This is a common side effect of many medications, including hormonal birth control, and can be caused by changes in appetite, metabolism, or fluid retention.\n3. Muscle cramps / myalgias: Muscle cramps are caused by changes in muscle contraction or relaxation, and can be related to hormonal changes, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances. Myalgias are a type of muscle pain.\n4.
