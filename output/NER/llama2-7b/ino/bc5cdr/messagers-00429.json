Identify the organ or body part mentioned in the paragraph:\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"bladder\" which is an organ in the urinary system.\n\n2. Identify the disease or disorder related to the organ or body part mentioned:\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"delayed toxicity\" which is a type of adverse effect or harmful impact on the bladder.\n\n3. Identify the specific disease or disorder mentioned in the paragraph:\n\nThe paragraph specifically mentions \"cyclophosphamide-induced bladder disease\" which is a type of disease or disorder caused by the use of cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapy drug.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Bladder disease\n* Cyclophosphamide-induced bladder disease"},
