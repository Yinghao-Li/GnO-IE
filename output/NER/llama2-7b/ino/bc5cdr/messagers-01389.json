Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" entities one by one:\n\n1. \"Chronic lesion\" - This is a type of disease entity, as it refers to a persistent and irreversible damage or disruption of a tissue or organ.\n2. \"rostral ventrolateral medulla\" - This is a specific location in the brain, which is a disease entity in itself. The \"rostral\" refers to the anterior (front) part of the brain, the \"ventrolateral\" refers to the lower and side parts of the brain, and the \"medulla\" refers to the medulla oblongata, a part of the brainstem.\n3. \"spontaneously hypertensive rats\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific breed of rat that is prone to developing high blood pressure without any external factors.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Chronic lesion\n* Rostral ventrolateral medulla\n* Spontaneously hypertensive rats"},

Chronic: This is a time-related term, indicating that the lesion is ongoing or persistent.\n2. lesion: This refers to a localized abnormality or damage in the body, which in this case is in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats.\n3. rostral: This adjective refers to the anterior (front) part of the medulla.\n4. ventrolateral: This adjective refers to the lower and side (lateral) part of the medulla.\n5. medulla: This is the name of a structure in the brain that is involved in controlling various autonomic functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
