Cytochrome P450 2D6: This is an enzyme that is responsible for metabolizing terbinafine, the drug being studied in the paragraph.\n2. Sinus bradycardia: This is a type of heart rhythm disorder characterized by a slow heart rate, typically less than 60 beats per minute.\n3. Metoprolol: This is a medication that is used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and heart failure. It is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme.\n\nSo, in summary, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cytochrome P450 2D6\n2. Sinus bradycardia\n3. Metoprolol"},
