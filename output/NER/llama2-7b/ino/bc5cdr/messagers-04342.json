Hemolytic: Hemolytic refers to the breakdown or destruction of red blood cells, which are the chemical components of blood.\n3. Anemia: Anemia refers to a condition in which the body does not have enough red blood cells or the red blood cells do not have enough hemoglobin, which is a protein that carries oxygen in the blood.\n4. Immune: Immune refers to the body's defense system, which includes a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body against infection and disease.\n5. Mechanisms: Mechanisms refer to the processes or systems by which something works or operates. In this context, the term \"immune mechanisms\" refers to the ways in which the immune system works to protect the body.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Drug\n2.
