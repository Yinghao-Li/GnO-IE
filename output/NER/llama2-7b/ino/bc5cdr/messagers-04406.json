Down-regulation: This is a process by which the expression of a gene or protein is reduced, often in response to a stimulus. In the context of the paragraph, down-regulation refers to the decrease in the expression of alpha and beta adrenoceptors in response to epinephrine.\n2. Alpha adrenoceptor: This is a type of G-protein-coupled receptor that is activated by the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. In the paragraph, the down-regulation of alpha adrenoceptors is mentioned.\n3. Beta adrenoceptor: This is another type of G-protein-coupled receptor that is activated by the neurotransmitter epinephrine. In the paragraph, the down-regulation of beta adrenoceptors is mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Down-regulation\n2. Alpha adrenoceptor\n3. Beta adrenoceptor"},
