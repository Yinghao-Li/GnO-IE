Ischemia: A condition where there is a reduction in blood flow to a particular tissue or organ, leading to cellular damage and impaired function.\n2. Bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus: A specific type of ischemia that affects both sides of the globus pallidus, a structure in the brain responsible for movement control.\n3. Alcohol use disorder: A chronic condition characterized by excessive and compulsive alcohol consumption, leading to physical and psychological dependence.\n4. Intranasal cocaine use: The use of cocaine through the nasal route, which can lead to various adverse effects on the body and brain, including ischemia.\n\nTherefore, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are ischemia, bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus, alcohol use disorder, and intranasal cocaine use."},

Alcohol: Alcohol is a chemical substance that can cause ischemia (reduced blood flow) to various parts of the body, including the globus pallidus.\n2.
