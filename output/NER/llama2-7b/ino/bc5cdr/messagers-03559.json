Opioid overdose: The paragraph mentions the effect of naloxone in antagonizing the opioid effect, suggesting that opioid overdose is a potential disease or condition.\n2.

Morphine: This is another chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph as a substance that can antagonize (or reverse) the effects of naloxone. Morphine is an opioid, a type of drug that is commonly used to treat pain.\n3. Opioids: This is a class of chemical entities that are mentioned in the paragraph as the type of drugs that naloxone can antagonize. Opioids are a group of drugs that are used to treat pain, but they can also have other effects on the body and brain.\n\nSo, the three chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
