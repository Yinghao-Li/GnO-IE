Arrhythmia: Arrhythmia refers to abnormal heart rhythms or irregular heartbeats. It can be caused by various factors, including disease, injury, or genetic conditions.\n2. BaCl2: BaCl2 is likely a chemical compound, but it is not a disease entity.\n3. Chloroform: Chloroform is a chemical compound, not a disease entity.\n4. Adrenaline: Adrenaline is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that helps the body respond to stress. It is not a disease entity.\n5. Strophantine G: Strophantine G is not a commonly recognized disease entity. It is possible that it is a misspelling or a made-up term.\n6. Aconitine: Aconitine is a toxic alkaloid found in the plant Aconitum, also known as monkshood or wolf's bane. It is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"Arrhythmia\"."},
