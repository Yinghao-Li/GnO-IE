To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"B6C3\" - This is a mouse strain, which is not a disease entity.\n2. \"mice\" - This is a general term for small rodents, and it is not a disease entity.\n3. \"treated\" - This verb does not indicate the presence of a disease entity.\n4. \"a single dose of 20 mg / kg ADR\" - \"ADR\" is an abbreviation for \"adriamycin,\" which is a chemotherapy drug used to treat cancer. So, the disease entity in this sentence is \"cancer.\"\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"cancer.\""},
