White matter hypertrophy: This refers to an abnormal increase in the size of the white matter in the brain.\n2. Myelination: This refers to the process of forming a fatty insulating layer around nerve fibers, which helps to speed up the transmission of nerve impulses.\n3. Gliosis: This refers to the formation of scar tissue in the brain, which can occur as a result of injury or disease.\n4. Neuronal damage: This refers to damage to the nerve cells in the brain, which can result in a range of cognitive and motor problems.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
