METH: METH is mentioned as the substance that is administered to the subjects, which can cause a significant increase in immobility time in the tail suspension test. Therefore, METH can be considered as a disease entity.\n2. Immobility time: The term \"immobility time\" refers to the duration of time during which the subject is unable to move its tail, which is an indicator of the severity of the disease.\n3. Tail suspension test: The tail suspension test is a scientific test used to assess the effect of a substance on the nervous system of an organism. In this test, the tail of the subject is suspended in mid-air, and the duration of time until the tail falls is measured. The test is used to assess the effect of a substance on the nervous system, and a longer immobility time indicates a more severe effect.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are METH and immobility time, while the test used to measure the effect of the disease is the tail suspension test."},
