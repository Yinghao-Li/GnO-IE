Electrolytes: The Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electrical activity of the heart, which is influenced by electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.\n2. Cardiac glycosides: Torsade de pointes is a type of cardiac arrhythmia that can be caused by drugs such as digoxin (Lanoxin), which is a cardiac glycoside.\n3. QT interval: The QT interval is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. Prolongation of the QT interval can be caused by a variety of factors, including certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, and genetic conditions.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Electrolytes\n* Cardiac glycosides\n* QT interval"},
