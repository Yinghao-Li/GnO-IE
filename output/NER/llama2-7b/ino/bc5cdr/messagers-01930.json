Coronary CTA (computed tomography angiography): This is a diagnostic test used to evaluate the coronary arteries and diagnose CAD.\n3. Maximal stenosis: This refers to the degree of blockage or narrowing in the coronary arteries, which can be measured using coronary CTA. In the paragraph, the maximum stenosis is mentioned as being less than 50%.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Coronary artery disease (CAD)\n2.
