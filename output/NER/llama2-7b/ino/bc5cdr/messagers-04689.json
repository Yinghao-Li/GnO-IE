The \"this\" refers to the response or outcome that is being described.\n\nDisease entity: Patients\n\n2. \"more often had a history of hypertension\": This clause indicates that the patients in the group being studied have a higher incidence of hypertension (high blood pressure) compared to the general population.\n\nDisease entity: Hypertension\n\n3. \"had higher resting systolic and diastolic BP before dobutamine infusion\": This clause suggests that the patients in the group being studied have higher resting blood pressure levels (systolic and diastolic) compared to the general population.\n\nDisease entities: Hypertension (again, as it is mentioned again in the clause) and High Blood Pressure (as it is a broader term that includes hypertension)\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Patients\n* Hypertension\n* High Blood Pressure"},
