Levodopa: Levodopa is a chemical compound that is used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). It is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps to replace the dopamine that is lost in PD patients.\n2. MPTP: MPTP is a chemical compound that is used to induce a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients. MPTP is a toxic compound that selectively kills dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to symptoms similar to those seen in PD patients.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, \"levodopa\" and \"MPTP\" are the two chemical entities mentioned."},
