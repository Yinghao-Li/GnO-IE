Dosage: This refers to the amount of a medication that is prescribed or taken at one time.\n\nSo, while the term \"Disease\" does not appear directly in the paragraph, we can infer that the passage is related to the study of drug levels and their effects on the body, which is a aspect of disease diagnosis and treatment."},
