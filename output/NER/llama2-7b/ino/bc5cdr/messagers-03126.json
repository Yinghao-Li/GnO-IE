Protein: \"infarcted myocardium\" is a type of tissue that is affected by a lack of blood supply, and \"protein\" is a component of tissues.\n2. Oxygen: The phrase \"target to protect\" suggests that the mechanism being described is aimed at protecting tissues that are oxygen-dependent, such as the myocardium.\n3. Glucose: The mechanism being described may involve the use of glucose, a type of sugar, to provide energy to the myocardium.\n4. ATP: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a molecule that serves as the primary energy currency of the cell, and it is involved in many cellular processes, including muscle contraction.\n5. Enzymes: Enzymes are biological molecules that facilitate chemical reactions in the body, and they may be involved in the mechanism being described.\n\nThere may be other entities in the paragraph that could be considered \"Chemical\" entities, but these are the most obvious ones."},
