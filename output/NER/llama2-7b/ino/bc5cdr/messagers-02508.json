METH: Methamphetamine, also known as meth, is a highly addictive and dangerous drug that can cause serious physical and mental health problems.\n2. Depressive phenotype: This refers to a set of symptoms and behaviors associated with depression, including low mood, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, and difficulty concentrating.\n3. Monoaminergic deficits: Monoamines are a class of neurotransmitters that play important roles in mood, motivation, and other physiological processes. Deficits in monoaminergic systems have been linked to various psychiatric and neurological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.\n\nSo, in summary, the paragraph mentions two disease entities: METH and depressive phenotype, and two related disease entities: monoaminergic deficits and depression."},

METH: Methamphetamine, also known as meth, is a highly addictive and dangerous drug that can cause serious physical and mental health problems.\n2. monoaminergic: Refers to the monoamine neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers in the brain that play a crucial role in mood, motivation, and other physiological processes. The three main monoamine neurotransmitters are dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.\n3. depressive phenotype: Refers to the observable physical and behavioral changes that occur in an individual who is experiencing depression.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
