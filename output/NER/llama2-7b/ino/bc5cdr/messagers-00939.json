Functional changes: This refers to any changes in the functioning of a system or organism that are not necessarily caused by a specific disease. In this context, the functional changes induced by gentamicin are likely referring to changes in the functioning of the inner ear.\n2. Structural changes: This refers to any changes in the structure of a system or organism. In this context, the structural changes induced by gentamicin are likely referring to changes in the structure of the inner ear.\n3. Gentamicin: This is the specific disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which is a type of antibiotic that can cause inner ear damage.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
