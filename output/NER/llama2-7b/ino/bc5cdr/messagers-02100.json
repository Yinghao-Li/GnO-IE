It is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps to replace the dopamine that is lost in Parkinson's disease.\n2. Dopamine: This is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motor control and movement. It is produced in the brain and is involved in the transmission of signals between neurons.\n3. Motor fluctuations: This refers to the changes in muscle stiffness, tone, and movement that occur in Parkinson's disease. These fluctuations can cause difficulty with movement, balance, and coordination.\n4. Dyskinesia: This is a type of movement disorder that is characterized by involuntary, abnormal movements of the face, arms, and legs. It can occur in people with Parkinson's disease, especially as the disease progresses.\n5. Wearing-off: This refers to the gradual loss of effectiveness of levodopa over time, which can lead to a decrease in the ability to control movements.\n\nI hope this helps!
