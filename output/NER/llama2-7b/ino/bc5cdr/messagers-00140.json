Identify the entities associated with each keyword:\n * Amphotericin B: drug, treatment\n * NS: not specified (could be a disease or condition)\n * D: disease (could be a specific disease or condition)\n * AmB: Amphotericin B (a drug or treatment)\n3. Determine the relationships between the entities:\n * Amphotericin B is being used as a treatment in both groups (NS and D)\n * The concentration of Amphotericin B in the kidney is higher in the NS group than in the D group\n4. Identify the disease entities:\n * Based on the information provided, the disease entity in the paragraph is likely \"NS\" (not specified), as it is the group in which the concentration of Amphotericin B in the kidney is higher than in the D group.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is \"NS\"."},
