Sepsis: This is the underlying disease that the patient is experiencing, which is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to an infection.\n2. Shock: This is a serious medical condition in which the body's circulatory system is unable to provide enough blood to the organs and tissues, leading to low blood pressure and inadequate oxygenation.\n3. Pulmonary edema: This is a condition in which fluid accumulates in the air sacs of the lungs, leading to shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.\n4. Acute renal failure: This is a sudden and severe loss of kidney function, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the body.\n5. Metabolic acidosis: This is a condition in which there is an imbalance in the body's acid-base balance, leading to an excess of acid in the blood.\n6. Weight gain: This is a symptom of the disease, as the patient experiences an increase in body weight due to fluid retention.\n7. Leukocytosis: This is a symptom of the disease, as the patient experiences an increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood.\n\nI hope this helps!
