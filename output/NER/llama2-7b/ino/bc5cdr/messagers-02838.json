It is characterized by consistently high blood pressure.\n2. Oxidative stress: This is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to the development and progression of many diseases, including hypertension.\n3. Dex: This is likely a abbreviation for \"dexamethasone,\" a synthetic corticosteroid that is often used as a control in scientific experiments. In the paragraph, dex is used to induce hypertension in the experimental animals.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
