Read the paragraph and identify the keywords related to disease:\n\n\"Biochemical effects of Solidago virgaurea extract on experimental cardiotoxicity\"\n\nKeywords related to disease:\n\n* Cardiotoxicity\n* Experimental\n* Disease\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph that are related to disease:\n\nIn the paragraph, the following entities are mentioned that are related to disease:\n\n* Cardiotoxicity (a disease or condition that affects the heart)\n* Experimental (a disease or condition that is being studied or observed in a controlled environment)\n3. Determine the type of disease or condition being discussed:\n\nBased on the keywords and entities identified, it appears that the paragraph is discussing a disease or condition that affects the heart, specifically \"cardiotoxicity\".\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is \"Cardiotoxicity\"."},
