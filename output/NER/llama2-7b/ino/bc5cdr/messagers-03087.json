Acute disease: The paragraph compares the effects of p53 inhibition on cardiotoxicity in acute and late stages.

Late-stage disease: The paragraph also compares the effects of p53 inhibition on cardiotoxicity in acute and late stages. \"Late-stage disease\" can be inferred as a disease that occurs after a period of time, possibly after the initial symptoms have subsided.\n3. Cardiotoxicity: This is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to the toxicity of a substance or condition to the heart.\n4. DOX: This is a drug or toxin that is causing cardiotoxicity in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Acute disease\n2. Late-stage disease\n3. Cardiotoxicity\n4. DOX"},
