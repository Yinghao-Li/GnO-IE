FEV1: This stands for Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second, which is a measure of lung function used to diagnose and monitor asthma.\n4. Beta-agonists: These are medications that are used to treat asthma by relaxing the muscles in the airways and improving breathing.\n5.

Inhaled beta-agonists, such as salbutamol, work by stimulating beta-2 receptors in the airways, which helps to relax the muscles and improve breathing.\n3. FEV1: This is an abbreviation for \"forced expiratory volume in one second,\" which is a measure of lung function. In the paragraph, FEV1 is mentioned as a percentage of the predicted value, indicating the patient's lung function.\n4.
