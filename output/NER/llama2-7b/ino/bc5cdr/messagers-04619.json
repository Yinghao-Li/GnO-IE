    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the following \"Disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Torsades de pointes: This is a type of abnormal heart rhythm, specifically a ventricular tachycardia with a prolonged QT interval, which can lead to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.\n2. QT interval: This is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. A prolonged QT interval is associated with an increased risk of torsades de pointes.\n3. QTc: This is a measure of the QT interval corrected for heart rate. It is used to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes.\n4. Oral d, l-sotalol: This is a medication that is used to treat certain heart rhythm disorders, including torsades de pointes. The paragraph mentions the dose of oral d, l-sotalol in relation to the changes in the surface ECG (electrocardiogram)."},
