However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that are related to diseases:\n\n1. Cocaine: Cocaine is a highly addictive and illegal drug that can lead to serious health problems, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and psychiatric disorders.\n2. Ethanol: Ethanol is a type of alcohol that is commonly found in alcoholic beverages. Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to a range of health problems, including liver disease, heart disease, and various mental health disorders.\n3. Combination: The combination of cocaine and ethanol can be particularly dangerous, as the two substances can interact in harmful ways and increase the risk of adverse health effects.\n\nSo, while the term \"Disease\" does not appear in the paragraph, we can identify entities that are related to diseases or health problems."},
