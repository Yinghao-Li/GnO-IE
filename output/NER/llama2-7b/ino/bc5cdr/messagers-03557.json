Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * Scopolamine\n * methyl scopolamine\n * amnesia\n * latency\n * duration\n2. Determine whether each noun is a disease entity or not:\n * Scopolamine: Yes, it is a disease entity.\n * Methyl scopolamine: No, it is not a disease entity (it is a chemical compound).\n * Amnesia: Yes, it is a disease entity.\n * Latency: No, it is not a disease entity (it is a measurement).\n * Duration: No, it is not a disease entity (it is a measurement).\n3. Classify the disease entities into their respective categories:\n * Scopolamine: Neurological disorder (drug-induced amnesia)\n * Amnesia: Neurological disorder (amnesia)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Scopolamine\n* Amnesia"},
