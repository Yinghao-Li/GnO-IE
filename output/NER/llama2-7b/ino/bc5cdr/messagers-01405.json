Valsartan: This is a medication that is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\n2.

It belongs to a class of drugs called diuretics, which help to reduce fluid buildup in the body by increasing urine production.\n3. Placebo: This is a dummy or inactive treatment that is used as a control in clinical trials.
