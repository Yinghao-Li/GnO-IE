Entity:\n * \"Arterial blood pressure\" (MAP) - the pressure of blood in the arteries.\n * \"Heart rate\" (HR) - the number of times the heart beats per minute.\n3. Entity:\n * \"Central arginine vasopressin\" (AVP) - a hormone produced by the hypothalamus that helps regulate blood pressure and water balance.\n * \"Atrial natriuretic peptide\" (ANP) - a hormone produced by the heart that helps regulate blood pressure and fluid balance.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"spontaneously hypertensive\" (SHR), and the \"entity\" entities are \"arterial blood pressure\" (MAP) and \"heart rate\" (HR)."},

Arginine vasopressin (AVP): This is a hormone that is produced by the hypothalamus in the brain and plays a role in regulating blood pressure, water balance, and electrolyte balance.\n2. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP): This is a hormone that is produced by the heart and plays a role in regulating blood pressure, fluid balance, and cardiac function.\n3. Map (mean arterial pressure): This is a measure of the average pressure in the arteries, which is an important indicator of blood pressure.\n4. HR (heart rate): This is the number of times the heart beats per minute, which is also an important indicator of cardiovascular health.\n5. WKY (Wistar Kyoto): This is a strain of rat that is commonly used in scientific research, known for its normotensive (normal blood pressure) behavior.\n6. SHR (spontaneously hypertensive rat): This is a strain of rat that is known to have high blood pressure, which is used in scientific research to study hypertension and its underlying mechanisms.\n\nI hope that helps!
