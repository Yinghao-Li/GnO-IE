Scopolamine: A muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, which means it blocks the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors. Scopolamine is commonly used as a drug to treat motion sickness, but it can also have negative effects on cognitive function, including impairing learning and memory.\n2. Impairment of learning and memory: The study investigated whether nociceptin / orphanin FQ and nocistatin could modulate this impairment caused by scopolamine.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, \"disease\" entities refer to scopolamine and the impairment of learning and memory it causes."},
