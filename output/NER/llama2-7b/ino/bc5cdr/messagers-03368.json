Lung cancer refers to a type of cancer that affects the lungs. In the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned that diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, has been associated with lung cancer in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort.\n2. Genotoxic properties refer to the ability of a substance to damage the genetic material (DNA) of cells, which can lead to mutations and potentially cancer. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that diazinon has genotoxic properties, which may contribute to its potential to cause lung cancer."},
