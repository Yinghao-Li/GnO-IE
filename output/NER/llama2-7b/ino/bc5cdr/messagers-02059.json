Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is the result of a study on the effects of a specific event (SE) on the hippocampus.\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * CCR2 (a protein)\n * SE (a specific event, possibly a disease or condition)\n * hippocampus (a part of the brain)\n3. Determine if the entities are disease entities:\n * CCR2 is a protein that is involved in the immune response, so it is not a disease entity.\n * SE is a specific event that has not been further identified, so it is not a disease entity.\n * Hippocampus is a part of the brain, so it is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"SE\"."},
