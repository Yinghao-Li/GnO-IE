Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Pilocarpine\n * neuronal death\n * pyknotic changes\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Pilocarpine (drug)\n * neuronal death (process)\n * pyknotic changes (pathological condition)\n3. Determine if each noun is a disease entity:\n * Pilocarpine is not a disease entity, it's a drug.\n * Neuronal death is a disease entity, as it refers to the process of cell death in neurons.\n * Pyknotic changes are also a disease entity, as they refer to a pathological condition in which neurons undergo pyknosis, which is a form of cell death.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Neuronal death\n* Pyknotic changes"},
