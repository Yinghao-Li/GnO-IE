ECG (Electrocardiogram) - a medical test that measures the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nExplanation: The paragraph mentions \"ECG values\" which implies that the test is used to measure the electrical activity of the heart.\n\n2. Movement disorders - mice with movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, can be studied using the new method.\n\nExplanation: The paragraph mentions \"freely moving mice\" which implies that the mice are not restricted to a specific location, and can move around freely. This could include mice with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. ECG\n2. Parkinson's disease"},
