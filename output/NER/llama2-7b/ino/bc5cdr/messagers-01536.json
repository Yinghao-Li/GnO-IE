To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Deaths related to cardiotoxicity\":\n * Disease entity: Cardiotoxicity\n * Characteristics: Deaths caused by damage to the heart muscle or cardiac function\n2. \"Marked changes in the heart\":\n * Disease entity: Heart disease\n * Characteristics: Abnormalities or damage to the heart muscle, valves, or blood vessels\n3. \"DOX-induced cardiotoxicity\":\n * Disease entity: Cardiotoxicity (related to doxorubicin)\n * Characteristics: Damage to the heart muscle or cardiac function caused by exposure to doxorubicin (a chemotherapy drug)\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
