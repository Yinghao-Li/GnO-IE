It is caused by the induction of streptozotocin (STZ) in the male rats.\n2. Testosterone: This is the drug being used to treat the memory impairment caused by STZ. Testosterone is a hormone that plays a role in memory and cognitive function.\n3. Streptozotocin (STZ): This is the toxic substance that is causing the memory impairment in the male rats. STZ is a toxic compound that can damage the pancreas and nervous system, leading to memory impairment and other cognitive problems.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Memory impairment\n2. Testosterone\n3. Streptozotocin (STZ)"},
