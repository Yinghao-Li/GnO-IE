Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"inadequate resting images\" - This is not a disease entity, but rather a finding or a characteristic of the patients.\n2. \"DSE\" - DSE stands for \"Disease Severity Estimate\". So, in this context, \"Disease\" refers to the disease being assessed using the DSE.\n3. \"inferior hypokinesis\" - This is a disease entity, specifically a type of cardiac dysfunction characterized by reduced movement of the heart muscle.\n4. \"rate-related atrial conduction deficit\" - This is also a disease entity, specifically a type of arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm caused by a problem with the electrical conduction system of the heart.\n5. \"did not reach the target heart rate\" - This is not a disease entity, but rather a finding or a characteristic of the patients.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Inferior hypokinesis\n* Rate-related atrial conduction deficit"},
