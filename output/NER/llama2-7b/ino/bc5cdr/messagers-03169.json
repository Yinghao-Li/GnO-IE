Seizures: This refers to a sudden and abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, including confusion, loss of consciousness, and muscle spasms.\n3. Pilocarpine: This is a drug that is used to induce seizures in mice for research purposes.\n4. Anticonvulsant: This refers to a type of medication that is used to prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.\n5. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid): This is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a key role in regulating the activity of neurons in the brain.\n6. Glutamate: This is an excitatory neurotransmitter that also plays a key role in regulating the activity of neurons in the brain.\n7. AChE (acetylcholinesterase): This is an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
