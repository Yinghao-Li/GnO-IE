Standard treatments - This is a general term that refers to a set of medical treatments that are considered to be the norm or standard of care for a particular disease or condition. As such, it is unlikely that \"standard treatments\" refers to a specific chemical entity.\n2. Median survival time - This is a statistical term that refers to the midpoint of a dataset of survival times for a group of patients. It is a measure of the length of time during which half of the patients in the group are expected to survive. While \"survival time\" is a chemical entity (i.e., a measure of the amount of time that a patient survives after treatment), \"median survival time\" is not a specific chemical entity, but rather a statistical concept.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"survival time\"."},
