CCK - 5 - 8: This refers to a specific peptide or protein that is involved in some disease process.\n2. Derivatives of CCK - 5 - 8: These are modified forms of the CCK - 5 - 8 peptide that may have different effects on the body and could potentially be used to treat a disease.\n3. CCK - 8 - SE: This is another peptide or protein that is involved in a disease process, and is being compared to the CCK - 5 - 8 peptide in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
