Hypersensitivity reaction: The paragraph notes that the serum albumin level decreased in the group that received 1.0 mg/kg doxorubicin, which could be an indication of a hypersensitivity reaction to the drug.\n3. Anemia: The paragraph mentions that the serum albumin level decreased from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter in the group that received 1.0 mg/kg doxorubicin. This decrease in serum albumin could be indicative of anemia, which is a common side effect of chemotherapy."},
