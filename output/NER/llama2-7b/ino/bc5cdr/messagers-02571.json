Patients: The patients who are being genotyped for specific genetic variants.\n\nNote: In this context, \"Patients\" is a disease entity because it refers to individuals who are suffering from an unspecified medical condition.\n\n2. rs4704559: A genetic variant, specifically an SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism), located at position 4704559 on a chromosome.\n\nNote: In this context, \"rs4704559\" is a disease entity because it refers to a specific genetic variant that may be associated with a particular disease or condition.\n\n3. rs10942891: Another genetic variant, specifically an SNP located at position 10942891 on a chromosome.\n\nNote: In this context, \"rs10942891\" is a disease entity because it refers to a specific genetic variant that may be associated with a particular disease or condition.\n\n4. rs4704560: Another genetic variant, specifically an SNP located at position 4704560 on a chromosome.\n\nNote: In this context, \"rs4704560\" is a disease entity because it refers to a specific genetic variant that may be associated with a particular disease or condition.\n\nTherefore, the three disease entities in this paragraph are \"Patients\", \"rs4704559\", \"rs10942891\", and \"rs4704560\"."},

Taqman: This is a type of DNA polymerase enzyme that is used in molecular biology techniques such as allelic discrimination.\n2. Assays: This is a general term for a chemical or biological test used to measure the presence or concentration of a particular substance. In this case, the Taqman assay is a specific type of assay used for genotyping.\n3. DNA: This is a chemical molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all living organisms.\n4. Polymerase: This is an enzyme that synthesizes new DNA molecules from nucleotides. In the context of the paragraph, the Taqman polymerase is used to amplify specific DNA sequences.\n5.
