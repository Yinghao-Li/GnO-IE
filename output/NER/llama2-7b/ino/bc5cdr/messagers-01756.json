To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Propranolol\" is a drug or medication used to treat a disease or condition.\n2. \"Fatty acid mobilization\" is a process or function that is related to the metabolism of fatty acids in the body.\n3. \"Lactate\" is a chemical compound that is produced during anaerobic metabolism, which is the breakdown of glucose or other organic molecules in the absence of oxygen.\n4. \"Glucose\" is a type of sugar that is an important source of energy for the body's cells.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Propranolol (a drug used to treat a disease or condition)\n* Fatty acid mobilization (a process or function related to the metabolism of fatty acids in the body)\n* Lactate (a chemical compound produced during anaerobic metabolism)\n* Glucose (a type of sugar that is an important source of energy for the body's cells)"},
