Tomography - Tomography is a type of imaging technique that uses X-rays or other forms of electromagnetic radiation to produce detailed cross-sectional images of the body.\n3. Brain - The brain is an organ that is made up of billions of neurons and other cells that communicate with each other through chemical signals.\n4.
