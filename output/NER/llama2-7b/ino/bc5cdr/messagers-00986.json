It is a yellow-orange dye that is used to detect the presence of malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation, in tissues.\n2. Edema is a condition where there is an accumulation of fluid in the tissues, often as a result of injury or inflammation. In the context of the paragraph, edema is being evaluated in the brain tissue of rats using microgravimetry."},
