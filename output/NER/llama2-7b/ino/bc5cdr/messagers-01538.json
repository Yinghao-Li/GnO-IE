Heart rate: The paragraph mentions that the heart rate in the animals was lower than that of age-matched control rats, indicating a potential disease or abnormality in the heart.\n2. Disease: The paragraph explicitly mentions that the animals had a disease, as it compares the heart rate of the animals to that of age-matched control rats.\n3. Abnormality: The paragraph also implies that there is an abnormality in the heart function, as the heart rate is lower than expected for age-matched control rats.\n\nTherefore, the entities identified as \"Disease\" in the paragraph are:\n\n1.

Heart rate: The heart rate of the animals in the study is being measured and compared to a control group, so it can be considered a chemical entity.\n2. Rat: Although \"rat\" is not a chemical substance, it is a biological entity that is being studied in the context of the experiment.\n3. Control rats: The control rats are a group of animals that are used for comparison purposes, and their heart rate is being measured and compared to the animals in the study group.\n4. P: P is a statistical value that represents the probability of the observed difference in heart rate between the study group and the control group occurring by chance. It is a chemical entity in the sense that it represents a mathematical calculation based on the data collected in the study."},
