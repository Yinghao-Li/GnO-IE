To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in bladder afferent pathways\" - This is a disease entity, as it describes a specific change in the expression of a protein (neuronal nitric oxide synthase) in a specific pathway (afferent pathways) in the bladder.\n2. \"following chronic bladder irritation\" - This is a disease entity, as it describes the cause of the increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in bladder afferent pathways\n2. Chronic bladder irritation"},

Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS): This is an enzyme that produces nitric oxide (NO) in neurons.\n2. Nitric oxide (NO): A small molecule that is produced by NOS and plays a role in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and immune response.\n3. Bladder: A hollow organ in the pelvis that stores urine.\n4. Afferent pathways: Nerve pathways that carry information from the bladder to the central nervous system.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS)\n* Nitric oxide (NO)\n* Bladder\n* Afferent pathways"},
