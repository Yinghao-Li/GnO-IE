Isoproterenol (E-1): Isoproterenol is a medication used to treat various conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure. It is an β-adrenergic agonist, which means it stimulates the β-adrenergic receptors in the body to produce various effects, such as bronchodilation and increased heart rate.\n2. Sedentary (S-I): Sedentary refers to a person who leads a largely inactive lifestyle, spending most of their time sitting or lying down. Prolonged sedentary behavior has been linked to various health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Isoproterenol (E-1)\n2. Sedentary (S-I)"},
