Oxidative stress: This refers to an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Oxidative stress can damage cells and contribute to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders.\n2. Nitrosative stress: This refers to an imbalance between the production of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Nitrosative stress can also damage cells and contribute to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders.\n3. Neuroinflammation: This refers to the activation of immune cells in the brain, which can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Neuroinflammation can contribute to various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
