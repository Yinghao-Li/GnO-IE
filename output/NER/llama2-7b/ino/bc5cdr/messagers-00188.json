Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Patients\n * Weight gain\n * Somnolence\n2. Identify the verbs in the paragraph:\n * Had\n * Experienced\n3. Identify the adjectives in the paragraph:\n * Statistically significant\n * Greater\n * More\n4. Identify the nouns in the paragraph that could be disease entities:\n * Patients\n * Weight gain\n * Somnolence\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Patients (mentioned as \"olanzapine-treated patients\" and \"placebo-treated patients\")\n* Weight gain (mentioned as \"weight gain\")\n* Somnolence (mentioned as \"treatment-emergent somnolence\")"},
