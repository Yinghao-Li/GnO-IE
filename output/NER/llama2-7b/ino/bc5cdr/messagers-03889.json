Thromboembolic phenomena\n\nLet me explain each of these entities:\n\n1. SAH: Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a type of stroke that occurs when there is bleeding in the space around the brain.\n2. Fibrinolytic syndromes: Fibrinolytic syndromes are a group of conditions that are characterized by the breakdown of blood clots.\n3. Thromboembolic phenomena: Thromboembolic phenomena refer to the formation of blood clots in the blood vessels, which can lead to blockages and other complications.\n\nI hope this helps!
