Seizures are abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, including convulsions, loss of consciousness, and changes in behavior.\n2. Status epilepticus: This is a type of seizure that occurs when a person has a seizure that does not stop or ends in a coma. Status epilepticus can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, head injuries, and genetic disorders.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are seizures and status epilepticus."},

Susceptibility - This is a measure of how easily something can be affected or influenced. In this case, it refers to the ease with which seizures can occur.\n3. Status epilepticus - This is a medical condition characterized by continuous or recurrent seizures that last for more than 30 minutes.\n4. Experimentally induced status epilepticus - This refers to the artificially induced seizures used in scientific experiments.\n\nSo, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Status epilepticus"},
