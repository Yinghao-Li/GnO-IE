To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Clentiazem\" is a drug or medication that is being studied for its effectiveness in treating a disease.\n2. \"Epinephrine\" is a hormone that is involved in the \"enhanced responses to calcium\" that are being observed in the animals.\n3. The \"animals\" in the paragraph are the subjects of the study, and they are being tested for their response to both clentiazem and epinephrine.\n4. The \"disease\" that the paragraph is discussing is likely related to the \"enhanced responses to calcium\" that are being observed in the animals.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Clentiazem\n* Epinephrine\n* Calcium\n\nI hope this helps!
