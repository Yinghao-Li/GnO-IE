WHO\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Male and Female are chemical entities as they are both nouns that refer to categories of people, which can be quantified and measured.\n2. Median is a chemical entity as it is a mathematical term used to describe the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order.\n3. Years is a chemical entity as it is a noun that refers to a unit of time, which can be measured and quantified.\n4. WHO is a chemical entity as it is an abbreviation for the World Health Organization, which is a specific entity that can be identified and quantified.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are Male, Female, Median, Years, and WHO."},
