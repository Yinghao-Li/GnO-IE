Metabolites: The paragraph mentions \"1,3-butadiene metabolites\" which are chemical compounds produced by the body as a result of the metabolism of 1,3-butadiene, a known carcinogen. Therefore, \"metabolites\" can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n2. Epidemiological reports: The paragraph mentions \"epidemiological reports\" which are studies that investigate the distribution and patterns of diseases in populations. In this context, \"epidemiological reports\" can be considered a disease entity as they provide information about the occurrence and prevalence of diseases in different populations."},
