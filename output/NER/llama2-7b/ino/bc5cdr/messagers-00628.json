Apoptosis: Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death, which is a normal and essential mechanism for maintaining tissue homeostasis.\n2. Fas: Fas is a protein that is also known as CD95 (Cluster of Differentiation 95). It is a transmembrane protein that plays a role in the Fas/Fas Ligand signaling system.\n3.
