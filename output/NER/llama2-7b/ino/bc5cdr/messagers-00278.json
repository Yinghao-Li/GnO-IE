    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! In this paragraph, the following chemical entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Sotalol: This is the drug being studied, which preferentially prolongs the action potential duration (APD) in M cells dose-dependently.\n2. Micromol: This is a unit of measurement for concentrations of drugs, where 1 micromol is equal to 1/1000th of a millimol.\n3. QT: This stands for \"QT interval,\" which is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. Prolongation of the QT interval is a known side effect of some drugs, including sotalol.\n4. TDR: This stands for \"torsades de pointes,\" which is a specific type of ventricular arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) that can occur as a result of QT prolongation. Torsades de pointes is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that can lead to cardiac arrest and death.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
