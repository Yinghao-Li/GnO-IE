Shortened period: The paragraph mentions that the mean period within each class of amplitudes shortened by 10-20 ms. This can be interpreted as a change in the duration of a specific period, which could be indicative of a disease or disorder.\n2. Mean periods: The paragraph also mentions that the mean periods calculated from all oscillations together did not change significantly. This suggests that there may be some abnormality in the duration of certain periods, which could be indicative of a disease or disorder.\n\nTherefore, the two entities that can be identified as \"Disease\" in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Shortened period\n2. Mean periods"},

Periods: The term \"periods\" refers to the time taken by a wave or oscillation to complete one cycle, which is a fundamental property of a waveform. In chemistry, the period of an oscillation can be related to the frequency of the oscillation and the mass of the particles involved.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Chemical\" entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
