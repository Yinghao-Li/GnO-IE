Scopolamine: Scopolamine is a medication that is used to treat motion sickness and nausea. It is also used as a sedative and to treat certain psychiatric conditions.\n3. MK-801: MK-801 is a drug that is used to block the action of a type of neurotransmitter called glutamate. It is used to treat certain psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and anxiety disorders.\n4. Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is a medication that is used to treat dry mouth and to stimulate salivary flow. It is also used to treat certain eye conditions, such as dry eye syndrome.\n\nIn the paragraph, these chemical entities are mentioned in the context of their ability to protect the brain from damage caused by pilocarpine."},
