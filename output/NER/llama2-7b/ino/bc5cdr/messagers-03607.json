Bile: Bile is a yellow-green fluid produced by the liver that helps in digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins.\n2. Cholestasis: Cholestasis is a medical condition characterized by the obstruction or impairment of the bile flow from the liver to the small intestine, leading to the accumulation of bile and bilirubin in the blood.\n3. Bilirubin: Bilirubin is a yellow pigment produced during the breakdown of red blood cells in the liver. It is normally present in the bloodstream in small amounts, but in cases of cholestasis, it can accumulate and cause jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are bile, cholestasis, and bilirubin."},
