Calcium: Verapamil works by blocking calcium channels in the heart, which helps to slow down the heart rate and regulate the heart rhythm.\n3. Junctional rhythms: These are abnormal heart rhythms that originate in the junction between the atria and ventricles.\n4. Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation: This is a type of heart rhythm disorder in which the normal conduction pathway between the atria and ventricles is disrupted, leading to irregular heart rhythms."},
