Organic brain lesions: Organic brain lesions refer to any abnormality in the brain tissue that is not caused by infection or inflammation, and can be caused by a variety of chemical factors, such as toxins or metabolic disorders.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
