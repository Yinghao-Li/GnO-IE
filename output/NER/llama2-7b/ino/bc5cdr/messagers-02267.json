Meningitis: Meningitis is an inflammatory disease of the meninges, the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. It can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\n2. Confirmed: Confirmed refers to a statement or diagnosis that has been verified or established through evidence or testing. In this context, \"confirmed meningitis\" means that the patient has been diagnosed with meningitis through medical testing.\n3. Warranted: Warranted refers to something that is deserved or justified. In this context, \"further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed meningitis is warranted\" means that additional medical testing is needed to determine the severity of the meningitis and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
