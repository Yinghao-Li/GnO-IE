Predictive models\n\nExplanation: Predictive models are mathematical models that use statistical techniques to analyze data and make predictions about future events or outcomes. In this context, the predictive models are being used to identify patients at high risk of developing certain conditions.\n\n2. Analyses\n\nExplanation: Analyses refer to the process of examining and interpreting data to extract insights and meaningful information. In this context, the analyses refer to the process of analyzing data to develop predictive models.\n\nNote: In this context, \"chemical\" refers to the chemical properties or characteristics of the entities mentioned, rather than their chemical composition."},
