Myelosuppression: This is the main toxic effect of the treatment, and it refers to a decrease in the production of blood cells in the bone marrow.\n2. Neutropenia: This is a type of myelosuppression that refers to a decrease in the number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood. In this paragraph, 16 patients had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.\n3. Anemia: This is another type of myelosuppression that refers to a decrease in the number of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the blood. In this paragraph, 12 patients had anemia.\n4. Thrombocytopenia: This is a type of myelosuppression that refers to a decrease in the number of platelets (thrombocytes) in the blood. In this paragraph, 11 patients had thrombocytopenia.\n5. Neutropenic fever: This is a complication of myelosuppression that occurs when the body's immune system is weakened, leading to an increased risk of infection. In this paragraph, 3 patients had neutropenic fever."},
