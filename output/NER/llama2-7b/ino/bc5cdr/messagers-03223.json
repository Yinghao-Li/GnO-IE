Acute kidney injury (AKI) - a sudden and reversible loss of kidney function that can occur due to various causes.\n2. Cisplatin - a chemotherapy drug that can cause AKI as a side effect.\n3. Kidney - the organ responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n4. Receptor - a protein on the surface of cells that responds to specific molecules, in this case, the kinin B2 receptor.\n5.
