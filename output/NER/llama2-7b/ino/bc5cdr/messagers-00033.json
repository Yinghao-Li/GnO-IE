    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Nociceptin: The paragraph mentions that nociceptin is also known as orphanin FQ, which suggests that it is a term used to describe a specific disease or condition.\n2. Orphan opioid receptor - like receptor 1 (ORL1): The paragraph states that nociceptin is a ligand for the ORL1 receptor, which is an orphan receptor. Orphan receptors are proteins that do not have a well-defined endogenous ligand or physiological function, and ORL1 is one such receptor.\n3. Central nervous system (CNS): The paragraph mentions that nociceptin is involved in various functions in the CNS, which is a system that is affected by many diseases and disorders.\n\nSo, while the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific diseases, it does imply that nociceptin is involved in the regulation of various functions in the CNS, which is a system that is affected by many diseases and disorders."},

Central nervous system (CNS): The paragraph mentions that nociceptin is involved in various functions in the CNS, which is a system that is affected by many diseases and disorders.\n\nSo, the two entities that clearly refer to \"Disease\" in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
