    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! In this paragraph, the following \"disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Mutation: The paragraph specifically mentions the mutation \"p. Val204Asp\", which is a genetic mutation that affects the protein's structure and function.\n2. Hydrogen bonding: The paragraph mentions the disruption of hydrogen bonding between certain amino acids (Gln223 and Glu441) due to the mutation.\n3. Catalytic triad functionality: The paragraph explains that the disruption of hydrogen bonding leads to the movement of Ser198 and His438 away from each other, which in turn disrupts the catalytic triad functionality of the protein.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are the mutation (p. Val204Asp) and the disruption of the catalytic triad functionality due to this mutation."},
