Valproate\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Lithium is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal that is highly reactive and flammable.\n* Valproate is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C8H16O2. It is a beta-oxidizing agent and is used as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of bipolar disorder.\n\nTherefore, both lithium and valproate can be considered as \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph."},
