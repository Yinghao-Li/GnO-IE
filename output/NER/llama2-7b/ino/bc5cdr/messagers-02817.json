Bradycardia: This is a medical condition characterized by a slow heart rate, typically defined as a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute.\n2. Cardiac workup: This term refers to a series of diagnostic tests and procedures performed to evaluate the heart and its function.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.

These tests may include electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms, and other diagnostic tests that measure various chemical and physical parameters of the heart.\n3.
