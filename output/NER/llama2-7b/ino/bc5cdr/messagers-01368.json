Potassium: This is a chemical element with the symbol K and atomic number 19. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the level of potassium in the patient's blood, which is 3.34 meq/L.\n2. PVC: PVC stands for \"Potential Difference of the Ventricles\", which is a type of cardiac arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the frequency of PVC, which reduced from 10-12 x / minute to 4-5 x / minute after three hours.\n\nSo, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
