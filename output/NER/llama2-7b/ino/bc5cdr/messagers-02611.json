Cortisol: a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that plays a role in the body's response to stress.\n2. Light: a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than visible light, which can be used to describe the intensity of a chemical substance.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Cortisol: The term \"cortisol\" refers to a specific chemical substance produced by the adrenal gland, which is involved in the body's response to stress. Therefore, cortisol can be considered a chemical entity in this context.\n2. Light: While \"light\" is not a chemical substance in the classical sense, it can be used to describe the intensity of a chemical substance, such as the amount of light emitted by a light source. In this context, the term \"light\" is being used to describe the intensity of the cortisol levels in the participants' bodies."},
