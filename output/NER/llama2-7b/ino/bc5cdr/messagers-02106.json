To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"PTRA\" - This could be a disease or a condition, but without more context, it's difficult to determine which one.\n2. \"PCI\" - This is likely a disease or condition as well, as it is a medical procedure used to treat a specific medical condition.\n3. \"basal creatinine\" - This is a measure of a patient's kidney function, which can be affected by various diseases or conditions.\n4. \"range 0 . 7 - 4 . 9 mg / dl\" - This is a range of values for basal creatinine levels, which can indicate the severity of a kidney disease or condition.\n5. \"matched for basal creatinine\" - This suggests that the patients in the PTRA and PCI groups have similar levels of basal creatinine, which is a common measure of kidney function.\n\nBased on these clues, it seems that the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are likely related to kidney function or disease, such as chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, or other conditions that affect the kidneys. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the specific disease or condition being referred to in the paragraph."},
