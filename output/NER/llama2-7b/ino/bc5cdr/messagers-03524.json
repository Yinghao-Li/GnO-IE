Beta-receptor blocker: This is a type of medication that blocks the beta receptors in the body, which can help to treat conditions such as high blood pressure, heart failure, and anxiety.\n2. Propranolol: This is a specific beta-receptor blocker that is mentioned in the paragraph as a comparison to the drug B 24/76 i.\n3. Beta 1-adrenoceptor: This is a subtype of beta receptor that is located in the heart and blood vessels, and is responsible for regulating heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure.\n4. Beta 2-adrenoceptor: This is another subtype of beta receptor that is located in the lungs and is responsible for regulating airway constriction and bronchial secretion.\n\nI hope this helps!
