Mania: This is a specific symptom of bipolar disorder, characterized by elevated or irritable mood, increased energy and activity, and impulsive behavior.\n3. Hypomania: This is another symptom of bipolar disorder, characterized by elevated or irritable mood, increased energy and activity, and impulsive behavior, but to a lesser degree than mania.\n4. Oxidative stress: This is a general term used to describe an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds.
