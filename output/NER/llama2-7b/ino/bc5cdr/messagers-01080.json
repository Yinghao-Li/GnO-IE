Progesterone: The paragraph also mentions \"combined continuous HT,\" which refers to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) that contains both estrogen and progesterone. Progesterone is a chemical substance that is used in HRT to balance the effects of estrogen in the body.\n3.

Thrombosis is a chemical process that involves the formation of a blood clot.\n4.
