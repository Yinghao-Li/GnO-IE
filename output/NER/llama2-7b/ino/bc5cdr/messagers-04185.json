However, there are some entities that could be related to chemistry or chemical processes:\n\n1. Visual acuity: This is a physiological process that involves the detection and interpretation of visual stimuli by the brain. While it is not a chemical entity per se, it is a biological process that involves chemical reactions and signaling pathways in the visual system.\n2. Brain: The brain is an organ that is responsible for processing and interpreting sensory information, including visual information. While it is not a chemical entity, it is a complex organ that is composed of billions of neurons and other cells that are involved in chemical signaling and communication.\n\nTherefore, the only \"Chemical\" entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"Visual acuity\", which is a physiological process that involves chemical reactions and signaling pathways in the visual system."},
