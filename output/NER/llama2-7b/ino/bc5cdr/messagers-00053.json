Cancer: The paragraph mentions \"cells\" being treated with compounds, which suggests that the cells are being studied in a laboratory setting, which is often the case in cancer research.\n2. Neurodegenerative diseases: The paragraph mentions \"0-24 h\" time frame, which is a common time frame used in studies of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, where the progression of the disease is often studied over a short period of time.\n3. Inflammatory diseases: The paragraph mentions \"compounds\" being used to treat cells, which could be drugs or other substances used to treat inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or inflammatory bowel disease.\n4. Metabolic diseases: The paragraph mentions \"microM\" units, which are commonly used to express drug concentrations in metabolic disease studies, such as diabetes, obesity, or metabolic syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities that can be identified in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cancer\n* Neurodegenerative diseases\n* Inflammatory diseases\n* Metabolic diseases"},
