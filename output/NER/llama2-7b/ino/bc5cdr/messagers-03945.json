Cardiac disease: The paragraph mentions \"cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors\" which are receptors found in the heart. Therefore, the disease mentioned is cardiac disease.\n2. Hypertension: The paragraph mentions \"hypertension\" as one of the conditions in which the activity of cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors has been studied. Hypertension is a disease characterized by high blood pressure.\n3. Heart failure: The paragraph also mentions \"heart failure\" as another condition in which the activity of cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors has been studied. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cardiac disease\n2. Hypertension\n3. Heart failure"},
