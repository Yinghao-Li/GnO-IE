Post-synaptic striatal D2 DA receptors: These are the dopamine receptors located on the postsynaptic neurons in the striatum.\n\nThese entities are mentioned in the context of the study's findings on the effects of trazodone on dopamine receptors in the striatum, which suggests that the drug may have different effects on pre- and postsynaptic receptors at different doses."},
