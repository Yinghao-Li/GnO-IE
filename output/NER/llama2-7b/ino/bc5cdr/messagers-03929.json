To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Treatment with propanolol\" - This is a medical intervention or treatment, so it is not a disease entity.\n2. \"administered intravenously\" - This is a method of delivery, not a disease entity.\n3. \"1-5 mg\" - This is a dosage range, not a disease entity.\n4. \"individuals\" - This is a population or group of people, not a disease entity.\n5. \"rises\" - This is a verb, not a disease entity.\n6. \"ranges from 11/6 to 22/11 mmHg\" - This is a numerical value, not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"5 individuals with\"."},
