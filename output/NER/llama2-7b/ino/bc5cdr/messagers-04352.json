LV: This stands for \"lateral ventricle\", which is a structure in the brain. It is not a disease entity.\n4. Arterial catheters: These are catheters that are inserted into the arteries to measure blood pressure or to administer medication. They are not a disease entity.\n5. Venous catheters: These are catheters that are inserted into the veins to measure blood pressure or to administer medication. They are not a disease entity.\n\nSo, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"WKY\" and \"SHR\", which are simply strains of rat used in scientific research."},
