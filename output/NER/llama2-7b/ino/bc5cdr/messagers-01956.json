Hypothermia: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, referring to a condition where the body's temperature drops below normal levels.\n2. Cerebral edema: This is a condition where there is swelling of the brain, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and potentially cause brain damage.\n3. Intracranial hypertension: This is a condition where there is increased pressure within the skull, which can also lead to brain damage.\n4. Fulminant hepatic failure: This is a severe and rapid liver failure that can occur due to various causes, such as viral hepatitis or drug toxicity.\n\nSo, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypothermia\n2. Cerebral edema\n3. Intracranial hypertension"},
