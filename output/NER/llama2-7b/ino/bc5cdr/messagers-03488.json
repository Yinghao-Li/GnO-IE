To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Hepatic injury\" is a disease entity.\n2. \"Multisystem clinical pattern\" is a broader concept that can encompass various diseases, including hepatic injury.\n3. \"Typical\" is an adjective that modifies the noun \"pattern,\" which suggests that the pattern is characteristic of a particular disease or group of diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hepatic injury\n2. Multisystem clinical pattern (which can include various diseases)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
