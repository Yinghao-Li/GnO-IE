Oral administration: This refers to the method of delivering a substance, in this case, the drug, through the mouth.\n2. 2,5-di-O-acetyl-D-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone: This is the name of the drug being studied.\n3. Renal failure: This refers to the failure of the kidneys to function properly, leading to waste buildup in the body.\n4. Kanamycin-dextran: This is the substance that is causing the renal failure in the rats.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Renal failure\n2. Kanamycin-dextran"},

Let's break down the entities in the paragraph one by one:\n\n1. \"2, 5-di-O-acetyl-D-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone\": This is a chemical compound that is being administered orally to the rats. It is a derivative of glucose, with a 2,5-di-O-acetyl group and a 1,4-6,3-dilactone structure.\n2. \"kanamycin-dextran\": This is another chemical compound that is being used to induce renal failure in the rats. Kanamycin is an antibiotic, and dextran is a type of sugar molecule that is used as a stabilizer in some pharmaceutical formulations.\n\nSo, the two chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. 2,5-di-O-acetyl-D-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone\n2. kanamycin-dextran"},
