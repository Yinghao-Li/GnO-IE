Verapamil responsiveness: This is not a disease entity, but rather a drug response. Verapamil is a medication used to treat various cardiovascular conditions, and its responsiveness is being measured in the context of its effect on basal prolactin levels.\n2. Peak percent change in basal prolactin levels (PRL): This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific measure of hormone levels in the body. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, and abnormalities in prolactin levels can be associated with various diseases, such as hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin levels) or hypoprolactinemia (decreased prolactin levels).\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity identified in the given paragraph is \"Peak percent change in basal prolactin levels (PRL)\"."},
