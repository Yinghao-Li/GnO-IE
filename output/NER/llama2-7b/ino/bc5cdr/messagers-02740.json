Tranexamic acid: This is a chemical compound that is mentioned in the paragraph as the substance that caused the overdose.\n2. Generalized seizure: This is a type of seizure disorder that is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can be induced by certain chemical substances, including tranexamic acid.\n3. Renal failure: This refers to the failure of the kidneys to function properly, which can be caused by a variety of chemical substances, including tranexamic acid.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
