To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Children\" - This is a patient population, which can be considered a disease entity.\n2. \"persistent sterile leukocyturia\" - This is a symptom, which can be associated with various disease entities.\n3. \"serum creatinine levels\" - This is a laboratory test result, which can be abnormal in various diseases.\n4. \"> 50 % above normal\" - This is a quantitative measure of the degree of abnormality in the laboratory test result, which can help identify the specific disease entity.\n\nBased on the information provided in the paragraph, the possible disease entities that could be associated with persistent sterile leukocyturia and abnormal serum creatinine levels are:\n\n1. Kidney disease: The increase in serum creatinine levels could be a sign of kidney dysfunction or damage, which could be caused by various factors such as infection, inflammation, or genetic disorders.\n2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Sterile leukocyturia can be a sign of UTI, which can cause inflammation and damage to the kidneys if left untreated.\n3. Nephrotic syndrome: This is a group of symptoms that include persistent loss of large amounts of protein in the urine, which can be caused by various underlying diseases such as minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, or lupus nephritis.\n4. Other causes: Other potential causes of persistent sterile leukocyturia and abnormal serum creatinine levels could include inflammatory conditions such as vasculitis or pyelonephritis, or certain medications such as chemotherapy drugs.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just potential disease entities, and a thorough medical evaluation and diagnostic workup would be needed to determine the specific underlying cause of the symptoms described in the paragraph."},

Sterile: a term used to describe a lack of bacteria or other microorganisms in a sample.\n2. Leukocyturia: the presence of white blood cells in the urine.\n3.
