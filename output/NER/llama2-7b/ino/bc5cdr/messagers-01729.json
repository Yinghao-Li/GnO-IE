Losartan: This is a drug or medication that is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).\n2. ADR (adverse drug reaction): This is a term used to describe an unwanted or harmful effect of a drug or medication.\n3. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS): This is a type of kidney disease that affects the glomeruli, which are tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): This is a term used to describe the final stage of kidney disease, in which the kidneys are no longer able to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood effectively.\n\nI hope this helps!
