Oxidant stress: This is a condition in which there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Oxidant stress can lead to cellular damage and increase the risk of various diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n2. Lipid peroxidation: This is a process in which lipids in the body are damaged by ROS, leading to the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Lipid peroxidation is a marker of oxidant stress and has been linked to various diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cancer\n2. Atherosclerosis\n3. Neurodegenerative disorders"},
