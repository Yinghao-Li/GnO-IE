Edema: Edema refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the tissues, which can cause swelling. In the context of the paragraph, edema is mentioned as one of the histological changes observed in the bladder of rats in both the model and intervention groups.\n2. Vasodilation: Vasodilation refers to the widening of blood vessels, which can occur due to various factors such as inflammation, infection, or injury. In the paragraph, vasodilation is mentioned as another histological change observed in the bladder of rats in both groups.\n3. Inflammatory cells: Inflammatory cells are cells that are involved in the immune response and can cause inflammation in the body. In the paragraph, infiltration of inflammatory cells is mentioned as a histological change observed in the bladder of rats in both groups.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Edema\n* Vasodilation\n* Inflammatory cells\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
