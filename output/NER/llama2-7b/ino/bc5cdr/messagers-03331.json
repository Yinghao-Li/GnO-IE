It refers to the excessive leakage of protein from the tubules in the kidneys.\n2. \"Oxidative stress\" is a disease entity. It refers to an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Tubular proteinuria\n2. Oxidative stress"},

Oxidative stress: This refers to an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds.
