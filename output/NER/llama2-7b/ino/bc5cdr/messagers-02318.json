Transfusion reaction: The paragraph mentions \"Transfusion therapy\" which implies that the patient received blood transfusions. Transfusion reactions can occur due to various reasons, including incompatibility of blood types, infection, or adverse reactions to the transfused blood.\n2. Corticosteroid side effects: Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammation and immune-related disorders. However, they can have side effects, such as hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia, among others.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"Transfusion reaction\" and \"Corticosteroid side effects\"."},
