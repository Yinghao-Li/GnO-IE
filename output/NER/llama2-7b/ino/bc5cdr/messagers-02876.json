Opioid: A type of drug that is used to treat pain, but can have inhibitory effects on the cerebellum.\n2. Dysmetria: A condition characterized by abnormal muscle coordination and movement, often resulting in impaired motor function.\n3. Dysarthria: A speech disorder characterized by slurred or slow speech, often resulting from damage to the cerebellum or brain stem.\n4. Reduced smooth pursuit gain: A condition where the ability to track a moving object is impaired.\n5. Decreased saccadic velocity: A condition where the ability to quickly move the eyes to a specific location is impaired.\n\nThese entities are mentioned in the paragraph as the potential side effects of opioid use on the cerebellum."},

Opioid: This is a chemical substance that is mentioned in the paragraph as having an inhibitory effect on the cerebellar structure.\n2.

Dysarthria: This is another chemical entity that refers to the abnormality in speech production, which is also caused by the inhibitory effect of opioids on the cerebellar structure.\n4. Smooth pursuit gain: This is a chemical entity that refers to the abnormality in the ability to track a moving object, which is caused by the inhibitory effect of opioids on the cerebellar structure.\n5.
