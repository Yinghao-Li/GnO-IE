Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) - not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but it is a common condition that can be treated with FESS (functional endoscopic sinus surgery).\n2. Hypotension - the paragraph mentions \"induced hypotension\" and \"low doses of remifentanil,\" which are related to the management of hypotension during anesthesia.\n3. Respiratory problems - the paragraph mentions \"airway management\" and \"quality of operative field,\" which are related to respiratory issues during surgery.\n4. Sinusitis - FESS (functional endoscopic sinus surgery) is a surgical procedure used to treat sinusitis and other respiratory problems.\n\nI hope this helps!
