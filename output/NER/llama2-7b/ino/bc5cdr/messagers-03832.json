To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"PPA\" - This could potentially stand for \"Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,\" which is a disease characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery.\n2. \"75 mg alone\" - This refers to the dose of a medication, which could be a drug used to treat a disease.\n3. \"increased blood pressure\" - This is a symptom of many diseases, including hypertension, which is a common disease characterized by high blood pressure.\n4. \"propranolol pretreatment\" - This refers to the use of a medication called propranolol, which is a beta-blocker used to treat various conditions, including hypertension.\n5. \"antagonized this increase\" - This phrase suggests that the propranolol medication had a opposite effect on the blood pressure increase compared to the original increase caused by the \"75 mg alone\" dose.\n\nBased on these clues, it is possible that the disease entity being referred to in the paragraph is hypertension, and the medication being discussed is propranolol."},
