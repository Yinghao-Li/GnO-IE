Identify the key terms related to the disease: In this paragraph, the key term related to the disease is \"flecainide.\"\n3. Determine if the term is a disease name or a laboratory test result: Based on the context, \"flecainide\" is a disease name, as it is a medication used to treat certain heart conditions.\n4. Identify the disease entity: The disease entity in the paragraph is \"tachycardia,\" which is a type of abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"tachycardia\" and \"flecainide.\""},
