Nicotinic receptor: The paragraph mentions a controversy surrounding the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor, which is a type of receptor found in the nervous system.\n2. Alpha-bungarotoxin binding: Alpha-bungarotoxin is a toxin found in the venom of the Bungarus fasciatus snake. The paragraph mentions the binding of alpha-bungarotoxin to the nicotinic receptor, which is a measure of the receptor's activity.\n\nI hope this helps!
