Glial disease: The term \"glial\" refers to the glial cells, which are a type of cell in the nervous system that provide support and protection to neurons. The mention of \"glial markers\" suggests that the study is focusing on the glial cells.\n2. Neuronal disease: The term \"neuronal\" refers to the neurons, which are the main functional units of the nervous system. The mention of \"neuronal markers\" suggests that the study is also focusing on the neurons.\n3. Lesion: A lesion refers to a damaged or diseased area of tissue, which in this case is described as a \"massive lesion\" in the center of the SNR (structural nucleus of the optic nerve).\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are glial disease and neuronal disease, with the lesion being a specific type of disease entity as well."},
