    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"disease\" entities mentioned:\n\n1. Control group: No specific disease is mentioned, but it is a group of subjects that do not receive any treatment.\n2. High-dose group: The paragraph mentions that this group was treated with one intraperitoneal injection of indomethacin 20 mg/kg. Based on this information, we can infer that the high-dose group was treated with a higher dose of indomethacin than the other two groups.\n3. Therapeutic dose group: The paragraph mentions that oral indomethacin was administered to this group at a dose of 3.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 3 weeks. Based on this information, we can infer that the therapeutic dose group was treated with a lower dose of indomethacin than the high-dose group.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Control group: No specific disease\n2. High-dose group: Unspecified disease (based on the higher dose of indomethacin)\n3. Therapeutic dose group: Unspecified disease (based on the lower dose of indomethacin)"},
