QT prolongation: This is a type of heart rhythm disorder characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG).\n2. Cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors: These are drugs that inhibit the activity of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 enzyme, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs.\n3. Liver function: The paragraph mentions that liver function can contribute to QT prolongation, which suggests that liver dysfunction or disease can affect the heart's electrical activity.\n4. Potassium level: The paragraph mentions that potassium levels can also contribute to QT prolongation, which suggests that abnormal potassium levels can affect the heart's electrical activity.\n\nI hope this helps!
