To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Delayed cystitis\" is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is a type of cystitis, which is inflammation of the bladder.\n2. \"Inflammatory cells\" are the cells that are involved in the inflammation of the bladder. They are the cells that are infiltrating the bladder wall and causing the inflammation.\n3. \"Urothelium\" refers to the inner lining of the bladder. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that the inflammatory cells are infiltrating the urothelium and passing through it into the lumen.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Delayed cystitis\n2. Inflammatory cells\n3. Urothelium"},
