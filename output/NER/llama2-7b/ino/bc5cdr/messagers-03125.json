Myocardial infarction (MI): This is a type of heart attack caused by the blockage of a coronary artery, leading to damage or death of heart muscle tissue.\n2. Cardiac dysfunction: This refers to any abnormality in the functioning of the heart, which can result from various conditions such as MI, heart failure, or other cardiovascular diseases.\n3. Inflammatory responses: This refers to the body's response to injury or infection, characterized by the activation of immune cells and the release of inflammatory mediators.\n4. TLR4: TLR4 stands for Toll-like receptor 4, which is a type of receptor found on the surface of immune cells that plays a key role in recognizing and responding to bacterial infections.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myocardial infarction (MI)\n2. Cardiac dysfunction\n3. Inflammatory responses\n4. TLR4 activities"},
