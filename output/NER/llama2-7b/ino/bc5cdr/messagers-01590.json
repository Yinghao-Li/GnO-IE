Hepatitis B virus (HBV): This is the disease-causing agent mentioned in the paragraph. HBV is a viral infection that affects the liver and can lead to chronic liver disease and liver cancer.\n2. Lamivudine: This is a medication or drug mentioned in the paragraph. Lamivudine is an antiviral drug used to treat chronic hepatitis B.\n3. Chronic hepatitis B: This is the disease state mentioned in the paragraph. Chronic hepatitis B is a long-term infection of the liver by the hepatitis B virus, which can lead to liver damage, liver failure, and liver cancer."},

Let's break down the entities in the paragraph one by one:\n\n1. \"YMDD\" - This is an abbreviation for \"YMDD motif,\" which refers to a specific sequence of nucleotides in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome.\n2. \"resistant\" - This term refers to the ability of the HBV mutants to resist the effects of lamivudine, a drug used to treat HBV infection.\n3. \"hepatitis B virus\" - This is the name of the virus that causes hepatitis B, a liver infection.\n4. \"lamivudine\" - This is the name of the drug used to treat HBV infection.\n5. \"untreated chronic hepatitis B patients\" - This refers to individuals who have chronic hepatitis B infection but have not received treatment with lamivudine or other antiviral drugs.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* YMDD\n* lamivudine"},
