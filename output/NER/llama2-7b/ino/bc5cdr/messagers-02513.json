Depression: The paragraph mentions that another neurochemical feature of depression, astroglial dysfunction, was studied.\n2. Astroglial dysfunction: This is the specific disease entity being studied in the context of depression.\n3. Depression: The paragraph also mentions depression as a whole, rather than a specific type of depression.\n4. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP): This is the astrocytic protein marker that was measured in the study.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Depression\n2. Astroglial dysfunction\n3. Depression (as a whole)\n4. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)"},

Neurochemical - refers to chemical substances produced or involved in the nervous system.\n2. Depression - a mental disorder characterized by low mood, loss of interest in activities, and changes in cognitive function.\n3. Astroglial - refers to a type of glial cell that provides support and maintenance functions for neurons in the central nervous system.\n4. Dysfunction - refers to abnormal or impaired functioning of a system or structure.\n5. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) - a protein expressed in astrocytes, which are a type of glial cell.\n6.
