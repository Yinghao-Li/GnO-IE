Hyperinsulinemia: This is a disease entity, as it refers to an abnormal increase in insulin levels in the blood.\n2. Insulin resistance: This is also a disease entity, as it refers to a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels.\n\nSo, the two disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hyperinsulinemia\n2. Insulin resistance"},
