Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Assessment of retinal function\n * abnormal responses\n * VGB users\n * patients\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Assessment: function\n * abnormal responses: responses\n * VGB users: users\n * patients: patients\n3. Identify the disease entities in the paragraph:\n * abnormal responses (disease entity)\n * VGB users (disease entity)\n * patients (disease entity)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Abnormal responses\n* VGB users\n* Patients"},

VGB: VGB is an abbreviation for \"vertebrate growth factor.\" It is a chemical entity that is used in the context of the paragraph.\n2. Retinal function: This is a biological process or function that involves the retina, which is a sensory organ in the eye.\n3. Responses: This is a general term that refers to the way in which a system or organism responds to a stimulus. In the context of the paragraph, \"responses\" likely refers to the way in which the retina responds to the presence of VGB.\n4. Abnormal responses: This is a term that refers to changes in the way in which the retina responds to VGB that are outside of the normal range.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
