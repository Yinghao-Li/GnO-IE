Hemophilia (HIT) - Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot, and it is characterized by prolonged bleeding.\n2. Hepatic impairment - Hepatic impairment refers to any type of liver disease or damage that affects the liver's ability to function properly.\n3.

Heparin: This is a natural anticoagulant that is used to prevent blood clots. It works by inhibiting the activity of factor Xa and other coagulation factors.\n3. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): This is a blood test that measures the time it takes for the blood to form a clot.
