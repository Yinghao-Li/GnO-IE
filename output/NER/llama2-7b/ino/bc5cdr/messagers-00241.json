To identify the chemical entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Peak\": This is a noun that refers to the highest level or point of something. In this case, it refers to the highest level of cocaethylene in the serum.\n2. \"serum\": This is a noun that refers to the liquid part of the blood that contains the blood cells.\n3. \"cocaethylene\": This is a chemical entity that is formed when cocaine is metabolized in the body. It is a metabolite of cocaine.\n4. \"concentrations\": This is a noun that refers to the amount of a substance present in a given volume of a solution. In this case, it refers to the amount of cocaethylene present in the serum.\n5. \"prolonged\": This is an adjective that refers to something that lasts for a longer time than usual. In this case, it refers to the duration of the myocardial depression.\n6. \"myocardial depression\": This is a noun that refers to a condition where the muscles of the heart are weakened or damaged.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* cocaethylene\n* serum\n\nI hope this helps!
