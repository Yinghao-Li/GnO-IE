To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"HL60\" and \"HBMP\" - These are likely disease names or cell lines, as they are mentioned in the context of cell death (apoptosis) induced by different compounds.\n2. \"apoptosis\" - This is a disease process, a type of programmed cell death that occurs in response to various stimuli.\n3. \"NCQ436\" and \"NCQ344\" - These are likely disease names or compound names, as they are mentioned in the context of their ability to induce apoptosis in HL60 and HBMP cells.\n4. \"NCR181\", \"FLA873\", \"FLA797\", \"FLA838\", \"NCM001\", and \"NCL118\" - These are likely disease names or compound names, as they are mentioned in the context of their ability to have no effect on apoptosis in HL60 and HBMP cells.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* HL60\n* HBMP\n* Apoptosis\n* NCQ436\n* NCQ344\n\nI hope this helps!
