LH-releasing hormone (LH-RH) - This is a hormone that is involved in the regulation of the pituitary gland and the reproductive system. Abnormalities in LH-RH can lead to disorders such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and infertility.\n2. Pituitary gland - The pituitary gland is a small endocrine gland located at the base of the brain that regulates various bodily functions, including growth and development, metabolism, and reproductive function. Disorders of the pituitary gland can lead to a range of endocrine disorders, including hypopituitarism, hyperpituitarism, and pituitary tumors.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are LH-RH and the pituitary gland."},
