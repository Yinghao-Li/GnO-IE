Noradrenaline neurotoxin: This is a toxic substance that can damage or kill neurons that produce noradrenaline, a neurotransmitter involved in various physiological processes.\n2. DSP4: This is the specific type of noradrenaline neurotoxin used in the study.\n3. D-amphetamine: This is a drug that is used to stimulate the central nervous system and is known to have potential for abuse and addiction.\n4. Neurodegenerative disorders: The use of noradrenaline neurotoxins and D-amphetamine in this study may be relevant to the study of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.\n\nI hope this helps!
