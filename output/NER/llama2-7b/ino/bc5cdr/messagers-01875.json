Amygdala\n\nThese are all brain regions that are associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as:\n\n1. Prefrontal cortex: Involved in executive function, decision-making, and other higher-order cognitive processes. Impairments in this region have been linked to disorders such as ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression.\n2. Hippocampus: Important for memory formation and spatial navigation. Damage to this region can lead to difficulties in forming new memories, a condition known as anterograde amnesia, and can also contribute to the development of depression and anxiety disorders.\n3. Striatum: Involved in motor control and reward processing. Dysfunction in this region can lead to movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, as well as addiction and impulse control disorders.\n4. Amygdala: Responsible for processing emotions, particularly fear and anxiety. Overactivity in this region has been linked to anxiety disorders, while underactivity can lead to difficulties in experiencing emotions.\n\nSo, while the paragraph does not explicitly mention \"disease\" entities, it does refer to brain regions that are associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders."},
