Cardiac injury: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to any type of damage or disorder affecting the heart muscle or cardiovascular system.\n2. Epinephrine: This is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that plays a role in the \"fight or flight\" response to stress. The paragraph suggests that epinephrine may cause cardiac injury, so it can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n3. Adrenergic pathway: This is a biological pathway that involves the release of neurotransmitters such as epinephrine and norepinephrine from nerve cells. The paragraph suggests that clentiazem may affect this pathway, which could contribute to the attenuation of epinephrine-induced cardiac injury.\n\nI hope this helps!

Clentiazem: This is the name of the drug being studied in the paragraph. It is a type of calcium channel blocker that is used to treat various cardiovascular conditions, including high blood pressure, angina, and heart failure.\n2. Epinephrine: This is a hormone also known as adrenaline. It is produced by the adrenal gland and plays a role in the \"fight or flight\" response to stress. Epinephrine causes the heart to beat faster, increases blood sugar levels, and narrows blood vessels.\n3. Adrenergic pathway: This refers to a group of nerve receptors called adrenergic receptors, which are activated by the hormone epinephrine. These receptors are found in various tissues throughout the body, including the heart, blood vessels, and muscles. Activation of these receptors by epinephrine can cause a variety of physiological responses, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle contraction.\n\nI hope this helps!
