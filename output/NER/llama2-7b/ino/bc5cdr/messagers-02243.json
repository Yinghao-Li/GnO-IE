Hyperkalemia: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to abnormally high levels of potassium in the blood.\n2. Elderly patients: This is a population-based characteristic, as the paragraph specifically mentions the importance of monitoring potassium levels in elderly patients.\n3. ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme): This is a drug class mentioned in the paragraph, specifically ACE inhibitors, which are a type of medication used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure.\n4. ARB (Angiotensin Receptor Blocker): This is another drug class mentioned in the paragraph, which is similar to ACE inhibitors but works in a different way to lower blood pressure.\n5. Potassium-sparing agents: This is a drug class mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to medications that help preserve potassium levels in the body.\n6. Renal disturbance: This is a general term used to describe any type of kidney problem, including impaired kidney function or disease."},
