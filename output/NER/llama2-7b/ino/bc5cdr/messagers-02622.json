Convulsions: A convulsion is a chemical change in the brain that can cause abnormal electrical activity, leading to muscle contractions and convulsions.\n2. Status epilepticus: Status epilepticus is a chemical imbalance in the brain that can cause recurrent seizures without proper recovery time in between.\n3. Intubation: Intubation is a medical procedure in which a tube is inserted through the mouth or nose and into the trachea to help maintain airway patency and support breathing.\n\nThese entities are all related to chemical changes or imbalances in the body, which are the primary focus of chemistry in the medical field."},
