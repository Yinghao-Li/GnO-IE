Adverse events can be any unwanted or harmful effects of a drug or treatment, including diseases.\n2.

It suggests that the events were not severe or life-threatening, but rather mild to moderate in intensity.\n\nTherefore, based on the context of the paragraph, the disease entities that can be identified are:\n\n1. Adverse events\n2. Mild to moderate severity"},
