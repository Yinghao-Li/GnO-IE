N - methyl - D - aspartic acid (NMDA)\n2. aspartic acid\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. N - methyl - D - aspartic acid (NMDA) is a chemical compound that is commonly used in scientific research, including neuroscience and pharmacology. It is an amino acid that is structurally similar to glutamate, and it acts as an agonist at the NMDA receptor.\n2. Aspartic acid is another chemical compound that is commonly used in scientific research. It is an amino acid that is involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and protein synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are NMDA and aspartic acid."},
