Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): This is the type of cancer being studied in the trial.\n2. Stage IIIb or IV: This refers to the severity of the cancer, with IIIb being more advanced than IV.\n3. Platinum-based chemotherapy: This refers to a type of chemotherapy that contains a platinum-based drug, such as cisplatin or carboplatin.\n4. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs): These are a type of targeted therapy that works by blocking the action of a protein called EGFR, which is involved in cell growth and division.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* NSCLC\n* Stage IIIb or IV\n* Platinum-based chemotherapy\n* EGFR TKIs"},
