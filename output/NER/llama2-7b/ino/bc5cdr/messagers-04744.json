Coronary vasospasm: This is a condition where the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) become narrow or constricted, reducing blood flow to the heart.\n2. Myocardial ischemia: This refers to a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, which can lead to damage or injury to the heart muscle cells.\n3. Myocardial infarction: This is a more severe form of myocardial ischemia, where the reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle is so severe that it causes damage or death to the heart muscle cells, leading to scarring and potential long-term damage to the heart.\n\nSo, in summary, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
