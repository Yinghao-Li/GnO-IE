To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Abnormalities\" - This is a Disease entity, as it refers to an abnormality or deviation from the normal state of something.\n2. \"Pupil\" - This is a Body Part entity, as it refers to a specific part of the body.\n3. \"Visual\" - This is an Adjective entity, as it modifies the noun \"evoked potential\" and describes the type of potential being referred to.\n4. \"Evoked potential\" - This is a Disease entity, as it refers to a specific type of potential that is evoked or generated in response to a stimulus.\n5. \"Quinine amblyopia\" - This is a Disease entity, as it refers to a specific medical condition.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Abnormalities\n* Quinine amblyopia"},
