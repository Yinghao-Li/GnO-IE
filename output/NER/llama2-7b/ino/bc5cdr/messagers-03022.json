Thrombosis: The paragraph mentions \"partial revascularization of the SVC and central veins,\" which suggests that there was a blockage or thrombosis in these vessels.\n2. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The term \"thrombectomy\" used in the paragraph implies that there was a thrombus (blood clot) in the vessel that was removed through the percutaneous procedure. VTE is a type of disease that involves the formation of blood clots in the veins, which can cause blockages and damage to the vessels.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Thrombosis\n2. Venous thromboembolism (VTE)"},

Thrombectomy: This is a medical procedure that involves removing a blood clot from a blood vessel.\n2. Percutaneous: This means \"through the skin,\" and refers to the method of performing the thrombectomy through a small incision in the skin.\n3. Mechanical: This refers to the type of thrombectomy used, which involves using a mechanical device to remove the clot.\n4. Revascularization: This refers to the process of restoring blood flow to a vessel or organ that has been blocked or damaged.\n5. SVC: This stands for Superior Vena Cava, which is a large vein that carries blood from the head, neck, and upper limbs to the heart.\n6. Central veins: These are veins that are located near the heart and play a critical role in returning blood from the body to the heart.\n\nI hope this helps!
