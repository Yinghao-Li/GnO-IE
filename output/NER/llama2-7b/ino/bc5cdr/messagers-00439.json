Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * CY\n * toxicity\n * bladder pathology\n * mice\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * CY: disease\n * toxicity: toxicity (a disease or condition caused by exposure to toxic substances)\n * bladder pathology: bladder disease (a disease or disorder affecting the bladder)\n * mice: mice (a small rodent)\n3. Identify the disease entities in the paragraph:\n * CY (the disease caused by exposure to toxic substances)\n * bladder disease (the disease affecting the bladder)\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"CY\" and \"bladder disease\"."},
