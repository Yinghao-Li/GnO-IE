To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"VTD\" - This could potentially be a disease entity, but without more context, it's difficult to say for sure.\n2. \"Bortezomib\" - This is a drug used to treat certain types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma.\n3. \"Dexamethasone\" - This is a steroid medication used to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammation and autoimmune disorders.\n4. \"Thalidomide\" - This is a drug used to treat certain types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma and leprosy.\n\nSo, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the \"disease\" entities are:\n\n* Multiple myeloma (mentioned in the context of bortezomib and thalidomide)\n* Autoimmune disorders (mentioned in the context of dexamethasone)\n\nI hope this helps!
