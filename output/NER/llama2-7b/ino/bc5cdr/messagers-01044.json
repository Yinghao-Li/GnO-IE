Pilo (Pilomatricoma) - a type of skin tumor\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. CHX: The paragraph mentions the effect of CHX (chloramphenicol) on the width of the GAP43-ir band in the IML (inner medullary layer) of the skin. CHX is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. Therefore, CHX can be identified as a \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph.\n2. Pilo: The paragraph compares the width of the GAP43-ir band in the IML of CHX-treated animals (Pilo group) with that in control animals. Pilo is a type of skin tumor, specifically a pilomatricoma, which is a benign tumor that arises from the hair follicle. Therefore, Pilo can also be identified as a \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph."},
