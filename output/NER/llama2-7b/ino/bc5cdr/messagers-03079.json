It works by decreasing the amount of glucose produced by the liver and increasing the body's sensitivity to insulin.\n2. Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ): This is a chemical substance that is used to induce seizures in animals. It works by stimulating the brain and causing an abnormal electrical activity in the neurons, leading to seizures.\n3. Oxidative stress markers: These are chemicals that are used to measure the level of oxidative stress in the brain. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds.\n\nI hope this helps!
