Torsades de pointes: This is a type of cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, that can be caused by abnormalities in the heart's electrical activity.\n2. U wave: This refers to a specific type of electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform that is associated with an increased risk of torsades de pointes.\n3. QT interval: This refers to the time it takes for the ventricles to recover from each heartbeat, as measured by an ECG. Abnormalities in the QT interval can increase the risk of torsades de pointes.\n4. QTc interval: This is the corrected QT interval, which takes into account the heart rate and is used to standardize the measurement.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are torsades de pointes, U wave, and QT/QTc interval abnormalities."},

U wave: This is a type of electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform that is associated with the risk of torsades de pointes, a potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.\n2. SCL: This stands for \"steady-state complex length,\" which is a measure of the duration of the QT interval on an ECG.\n3. QT interval: This is the time interval between the start of the QRS complex (the beginning of the heart's electrical activity) and the end of the T wave (the final part of the heart's electrical activity).\n4. QTc interval: This is the corrected QT interval, which takes into account the heart rate and is used to standardize the measurement of the QT interval.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* U wave (a type of ECG waveform)\n* SCL (steady-state complex length)\n* QT interval (a measure of the duration of the QT complex on an ECG)\n* QTc interval (the corrected QT interval, which takes into account the heart rate)"},
