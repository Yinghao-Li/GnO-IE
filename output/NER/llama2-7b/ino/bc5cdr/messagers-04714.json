Coronary disease: The paragraph mentions \"intracoronary cocaine concentration,\" which suggests that the study is focused on the effects of cocaine on the coronary arteries.\n2. Heart failure: The paragraph mentions \"LV systolic and diastolic function,\" which refers to the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Coronary disease\n2. Heart failure (specifically, LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction)"},

Systolic: This refers to the contraction of the heart muscle during systole, which is the phase of the heartbeat when the heart contracts and pumps blood out of the heart into the circulatory system.\n4.
