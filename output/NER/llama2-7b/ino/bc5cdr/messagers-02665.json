Oxidative damage: This is a type of cellular damage caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Oxidative damage can lead to various diseases, including cancer, aging, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n2. Acute cardiotoxicity: This refers to the sudden and severe damage to the heart muscle, which can occur due to various factors such as exposure to toxins, drugs, or other harmful substances. Acute cardiotoxicity can lead to cardiac arrest, heart failure, and even death.\n3. DOX: DOX is an abbreviation for doxorubicin, which is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. Doxorubicin can cause cardiotoxicity, including acute cardiotoxicity, as a side effect of its treatment."},
