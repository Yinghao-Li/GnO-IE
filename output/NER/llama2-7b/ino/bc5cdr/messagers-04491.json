To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"nifedipine\" - This is a medication or drug used to treat a disease.\n2. \"CD-832\" - This is a drug or treatment, but it is not a disease entity.\n3. \"stenosis\" - This is a disease entity, specifically a narrowing or constriction of a blood vessel or other bodily structure.\n4. \"ISO infusion\" - This is a medical procedure or treatment, but it is not a disease entity.\n5. \"segmental shortening\" - This is a physical or anatomical change, specifically a decrease in the length of a segment of a blood vessel or other bodily structure.\n6. \"ST-segment elevation\" - This is a physical or anatomical change, specifically an increase in the height of the ST segment of an electrocardiogram (ECG) reading.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* stenosis\n\nI hope this helps!
