Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * The number of specific granules\n * The superficial cells\n2. Identify the nouns in the noun phrases:\n * Number\n * Specific granules\n * Superficial cells\n3. Check if any of the nouns are associated with a disease or disorder:\n * Number: Not associated with a disease or disorder\n * Specific granules: Not associated with a disease or disorder\n * Superficial cells: Not associated with a disease or disorder\n4. Therefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the answer is: None."},
