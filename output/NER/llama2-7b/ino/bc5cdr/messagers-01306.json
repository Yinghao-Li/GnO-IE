Galantamine:\nGalantamine is a chemical compound that is classified as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and nicotinic receptor modulator. It is used in the treatment of various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism.\n2. Acetylcholinesterase:\nAcetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain. By inhibiting this enzyme, galantamine increases the levels of acetylcholine in the brain, which can improve cognitive function and memory.\n3. Nicotinic receptor modulator:\nNicotinic receptors are a type of receptor found in the brain that are involved in the transmission of signals between neurons. By modulating these receptors, galantamine can improve the function of the nervous system and reduce symptoms of autism.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Galantamine\n* Acetylcholinesterase\n* Nicotinic receptor modulator"},
