Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) - This is the main disease or condition being studied in the paragraph. It refers to a potentially life-threatening complication that can occur when a local anaesthetic is absorbed into the bloodstream and causes systemic toxicity.\n2. Neonates - This is a population of patients who are born prematurely or at a low birth weight, and are therefore more susceptible to disease and complications. In the context of the paragraph, neonates are the patients who may develop local anaesthetic systemic toxicity.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
