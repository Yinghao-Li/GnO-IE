To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"CCK2 receptor antagonist\" - This is a drug or treatment that blocks or antagonizes the action of the CCK2 receptor.\n2. \"CCK1 receptor antagonist\" - This is another drug or treatment that blocks or antagonizes the action of the CCK1 receptor.\n3. \"reversed the effects\" - This phrase suggests that the treatment (the CCK2 receptor antagonist) had a reversing or opposite effect on something.\n4. \"did not\" - This phrase suggests that the second treatment (the CCK1 receptor antagonist) did not have the same reversing effect as the first treatment.\n\nBased on these clues, we can infer that the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* CCK2 receptor antagonist\n* CCK1 receptor antagonist\n* Reversal of effects\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are the drugs or treatments being studied, which are designed to target and affect the CCK2 and CCK1 receptors in the body."},
