Atrial fibrillation (AF): This is a type of arrhythmia, or abnormal heart rhythm, characterized by a rapid and irregular contraction of the atria.\n2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: This is a specific type of atrial fibrillation that is intermittent or comes and goes on its own, rather than being a constant condition.\n3. Sinus rhythm: This is the normal, regular heart rhythm that occurs when the heart is beating in a coordinated and regular pattern.\n4. Sudden cardiac death: This is a sudden and unexpected death that occurs due to a cardiac cause, such as a heart attack or arrhythmia.\n5. Sodium channel blocker: This is a type of medication that blocks the sodium channels in the heart, which can help regulate the heart rhythm and treat certain arrhythmias.\n6. Pilsicainide: This is the specific medication mentioned in the paragraph, which is a pure sodium channel blocker with slow recovery kinetics."},
