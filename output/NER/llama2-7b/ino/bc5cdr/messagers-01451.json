Tourniquet: A tourniquet is a device used to control bleeding by constricting a blood vessel or vein. It is typically used in surgical procedures to stop bleeding during or after an operation.\n2. Atriotomy: An atriotomy is a surgical incision made in the atrium of the heart. This type of incision is typically made to repair or replace a damaged or diseased heart valve.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Tourniquet (bleeding)\n2.
