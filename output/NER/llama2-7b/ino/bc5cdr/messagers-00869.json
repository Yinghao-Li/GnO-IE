Neurogenic DI (Neurogenic Diabetes Insipidus)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI: This is a type of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus that is caused by the use of lithium, a medication commonly used to treat bipolar disorder. Lithium can cause the kidneys to produce an excessive amount of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive thirst and urination.\n2. Neurogenic DI: This is a type of diabetes insipidus that is caused by damage to the central nervous system, which regulates the body's water balance. This can occur due to various causes such as brain trauma, stroke, or infection.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
