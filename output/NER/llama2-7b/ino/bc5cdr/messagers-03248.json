Neuromuscular blockade: This is a condition in which the neuromuscular transmission is blocked, leading to muscle weakness or paralysis. The rocuronium dose administered to the patients in the study is intended to induce this condition for the purpose of the study.\n3. Anesthesia: The paragraph mentions the patients being randomized to receive different doses of rocuronium as a precurarizing dose, which suggests that the patients are undergoing anesthesia.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
