Hypercholesterolemia: This is the condition of having high levels of cholesterol in the blood. The paragraph mentions that the total cholesterol levels decreased by 22% from 255 to 200 mg/dL, which is a significant reduction.\n2. Hypertriglyceridemia: This is the condition of having high levels of triglycerides in the blood. The paragraph mentions that the triglyceride levels decreased by 35% from 236 to 154 mg/dL, which is also a significant reduction.\n3. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) elevation: This is the condition of having high levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood. The paragraph mentions that the LDL cholesterol levels decreased by 26% from 176 to 131 mg/dL, which is a significant reduction.\n4. Dyslipidemia: This is a condition where there are abnormal levels of various types of lipids (such as cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol) in the blood. The paragraph mentions that the total cholesterol / HDL cholesterol ratio decreased by 24% from 7.1 to 5.4, which is a significant reduction.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, LDL elevation, and dyslipidemia."},
