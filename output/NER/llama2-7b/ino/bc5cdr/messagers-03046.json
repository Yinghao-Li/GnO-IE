Amiodarone - This is a medication used to treat various heart rhythm disorders, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.\n2. Paroxetine - This is an antidepressant medication used to treat depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders.\n3. Terfenadine - This is an antihistamine medication used to treat allergies, but it can also have cardiac effects, including prolongation of the QT interval.\n4. Citalopram - This is an antidepressant medication used to treat depression and anxiety disorders.\n\nIn this paragraph, these medications are mentioned as \"prolonging\" the FPDc (fractional phase duration of the cardiac action potential) in a concentration-dependent manner. This suggests that these medications can affect the electrical activity of the heart, which can be a sign of a cardiac disease or disorder."},
