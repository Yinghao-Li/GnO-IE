It is a drug or medication that is effective in retarding renal progression and protecting renal function in PAN nephropathic rats.\n2. Renal progression: This refers to the progression of kidney damage or disease. In this context, temocapril is effective in slowing down or retarding this progression.\n3. Renal function: This refers to the function of the kidneys. Temocapril is effective in protecting or preserving renal function in PAN nephropathic rats.\n4.
