Peripheral pain - This is a type of pain that is localized to a specific area of the body, rather than being widespread or systemic.\n3.

Pain: This is a physical sensation or discomfort associated with various stimuli, such as injury, inflammation, or infection.\n2. Peripheral: This refers to the outer parts of the body, including the limbs, organs, and other tissues.\n3. Activity: This refers to the state of being active or in motion, and can be used to describe various physiological processes, including chemical reactions.\n4.
