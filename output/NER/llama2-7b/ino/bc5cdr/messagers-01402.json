Acute encephalopathy: This refers to a sudden and severe change in brain function, which can cause confusion, disorientation, and changes in behavior.\n2. Behavioral changes: This refers to changes in the patient's behavior, such as agitation, aggression, or withdrawal.\n3. Aphasia: This refers to difficulty speaking or understanding language, which can result from damage to the language centers of the brain.\n4. Incontinence: This refers to the loss of bladder control, which can occur due to damage to the nerves that control the bladder.\n5. Visual hallucinations: This refers to seeing things that are not actually there, which can be a symptom of brain damage or disorders.\n6. Right-sided weakness: This refers to weakness or paralysis on the right side of the body, which can occur due to damage to the brain or spinal cord.\n7. Diffuse cerebral vasospasm: This refers to a narrowing of the blood vessels in the brain, which can reduce blood flow to the brain and cause damage.\n\nI hope this helps!
