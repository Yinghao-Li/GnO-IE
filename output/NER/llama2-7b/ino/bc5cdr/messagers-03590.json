Muscarinic: This refers to a type of receptor in the brain that is activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n2. Cholinergic: This refers to the system in the brain that uses the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n3. Pilocarpine: This is the specific chemical entity being referred to in the paragraph, which is a muscarinic cholinergic agonist.\n4. Acetylcholine: This is the neurotransmitter that is involved in the muscarinic receptor system.\n5.
