Histopathological examination: This is a type of medical test that involves examining tissue samples under a microscope to look for signs of disease.\n2. tubular necrosis: This is a type of kidney damage where the tubules in the kidney are damaged or die.\n3. D - AmB: This is likely an abbreviation for a specific drug or treatment, but without more context it's difficult to identify.\n4. NS - 718: This is also likely an abbreviation for a specific drug or treatment, but again, without more context it's difficult to identify.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* tubular necrosis\n\nI hope this helps!

D - AmB: This is a chemical entity, likely a drug or a toxin, that is used in the study. The \"D\" prefix suggests that it is a drug or a substance that is administered to the rats.\n2. NS - 718: This is another chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. The \"NS\" prefix suggests that it is a drug or a substance, and the number \"718\" could be a unique identifier for the compound.\n\nSo, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
