To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Rates of response\": This is a disease entity because it refers to the outcome or response of a disease, specifically the response to treatment.\n2. \"BP control\": This is also a disease entity because it refers to the control or management of a disease, specifically high blood pressure (hypertension).\n3. \"Combination treatment\": This is not a disease entity, but rather a type of treatment.\n4. \"Monotherapy\": This is also not a disease entity, but rather a type of treatment.\n\nSo, the two disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. \"Rates of response\"\n2. \"BP control\""},
