Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * Non - MI group\n * ANT - MI group\n * INF - MI group\n * total population\n2. Determine which of these nouns are likely to be disease entities:\n * Non - MI group\n * ANT - MI group\n * INF - MI group\n3. Check if the nouns you identified in step 2 are mentioned in the paragraph as being related to a disease:\n * Non - MI group: Yes, the paragraph states that ischemic ST - segment depression ( 0 . 05 mV or more ) was observed in 84 % of this group.\n * ANT - MI group: Yes, the paragraph states that ischemic ST - segment depression ( 0 . 05 mV or more ) was observed in 29 % of this group.\n * INF - MI group: Yes, the paragraph states that ischemic ST - segment depression ( 0 . 05 mV or more ) was observed in 63 % of this group.\n4. Identify any other relevant information in the paragraph:\n * The paragraph states that ischemic ST - segment depression ( 0 . 05 mV or more ) was observed in 61 % of the total population.\n\nBased on these steps, we can identify the following disease entities in the paragraph:\n\n* Non - MI group: Ischemic ST - segment depression ( 0 . 05 mV or more )\n* ANT - MI group: Ischemic ST - segment depression ( 0 . 05 mV or more )\n* INF - MI group: Ischemic ST - segment depression ( 0 . 05 mV or more )\n* Total population: Ischemic ST - segment depression ( 0 . 05 mV or more )\n\nI hope this helps!
