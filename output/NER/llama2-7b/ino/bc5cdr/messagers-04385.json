Fluoxetine: This is a chemical drug, specifically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), that is used to treat depression and other conditions.\n2.

Reuptake: This refers to the process by which neurotransmitters like serotonin are taken back up by the neurons that released them, which can affect their availability for further transmission.
