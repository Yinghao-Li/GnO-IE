Myocardial dysfunction: This refers to the dysfunction of the muscular tissue of the heart, which can be caused by various chemical factors such as toxins, drugs, or other substances that can damage the heart muscle.\n2. Circulatory failure: This refers to the failure of the circulatory system to maintain adequate blood flow and oxygenation to the body's tissues. This can be caused by various chemical factors such as shock, sepsis, or other conditions that can impair the body's ability to circulate blood effectively.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
