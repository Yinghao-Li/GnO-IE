Placebo - controlled: This is a type of study design where participants are randomly assigned to receive either the actual treatment (in this case, the peptides) or a placebo (a dummy treatment with no active ingredients).\n2. Single - blind: This means that only the participants are unaware of whether they are receiving the actual treatment or the placebo, while the researchers conducting the study are blinded to the assignment.\n3. Chemosensitivity: This refers to the ability of the body to detect and respond to chemical signals, such as those related to hunger, thirst, or pain. In the context of the paragraph, \"central chemosensitivity\" likely refers to the sensitivity of the central nervous system (CNS) to these chemical signals.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Placebo - controlled\n2. Single - blind\n3. Chemosensitivity"},
