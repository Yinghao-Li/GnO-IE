Hypoactivity: This refers to a decrease in the normal activity of a cell or organism.\n2. Hyperactivity: This refers to an increase in the normal activity of a cell or organism.\n3. Morphine-induced hypoactivity: This refers to a decrease in the normal activity of a cell or organism caused by the administration of morphine.\n4. Morphine-induced hyperactivity: This refers to an increase in the normal activity of a cell or organism caused by the administration of morphine.\n5. Quinine-sensitive K ( + ) - channels: These are specialized channels in the membrane of neurons that are sensitive to the drug quinine and play a role in the regulation of neuronal activity.\n6. 4-Aminopyridine-sensitive K ( + ) - channels: These are specialized channels in the membrane of neurons that are sensitive to the drug 4-aminopyridine and play a role in the regulation of neuronal activity.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are hypoactivity and hyperactivity, which are the effects of morphine on neuronal activity, and the specific channels involved in these effects, which are quinine-sensitive K ( + ) - channels and 4-aminopyridine-sensitive K ( + ) - channels."},
