PBSCT - PBSCT stands for \"Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation\", which is a medical procedure that involves the transplantation of stem cells from the blood into a patient's body. Therefore, \"PBSCT\" can be considered a chemical entity.\n2. Peripheral Blood - \"Peripheral Blood\" is a chemical entity that refers to the blood that circulates in the body's blood vessels outside of the heart.\n3. Stem Cells - Stem cells are a type of cell that has the ability to develop into different types of cells in the body. They are an important part of the body's repair and maintenance processes, and they are often used in medical procedures such as PBSCT. Therefore, \"stem cells\" can be considered a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. PBSCT\n2. Peripheral Blood\n3. Stem Cells"},
