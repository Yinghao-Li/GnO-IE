Chloride: This is a chemical element with the symbol Cl and atomic number 17. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the type of ion that is involved in the defective skeletal muscle channel function.\n2. Membrane: This is a chemical structure that forms the outer layer of cells, and it is mentioned in the paragraph as the site where the defect in the skeletal muscle chloride channel function may cause sustained depolarization.\n3. Depolarization: This is a chemical process that involves the increase in the positive charge on the inner membrane surface of a cell, which can lead to the activation of various cellular processes. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the possible outcome of the defect in the skeletal muscle chloride channel function.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Chemical\" entities identified in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Chloride (Cl)\n2. Membrane\n3. Depolarization"},
