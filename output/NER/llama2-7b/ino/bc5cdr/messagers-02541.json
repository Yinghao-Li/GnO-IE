HIT (Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome) - This is the disease entity that the paragraph is focusing on. HIT is a rare blood disorder that can cause hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney damage.\n2. Type II - This refers to the specific type of HIT, which is also known as HIT II. There are two types of HIT: HIT I and HIT II. HIT II is the more common of the two and is caused by a genetic mutation in the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. HIT (Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome)\n2. Type II (HIT II)"},

Postoperative course: This refers to the course of treatment or management of a patient after a surgical procedure.\n3.
