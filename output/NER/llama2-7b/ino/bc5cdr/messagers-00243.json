Veralipride: This is the drug that the patient was taking for menopause-related symptoms. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a brand name of a drug that belongs to a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n2. Parkinson's disease: This is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. It is caused by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra.\n3. Dopamine: This is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in movement and motor control. It is produced in the substantia nigra and is involved in the transmission of signals between neurons.\n4. Baseline: This is a term used to describe the normal or expected level of a particular parameter, such as blood pressure or heart rate, in a healthy individual.\n\nI hope this helps!
