Naloxone: This is a chemical drug that is used to reverse the effects of opioids, including morphine and other opioid agonists. It works by binding to opioid receptors and blocking the effects of opioids.\n2. MSG (monosodium glutamate): This is a flavor enhancer that is commonly used in food products. It is not a drug, but rather a food additive.\n\nSo, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Naloxone\n2. MSG (monosodium glutamate)"},
