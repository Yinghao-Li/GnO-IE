However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that are related to disease:\n\n1. GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid): A neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of neurons in the brain.\n2. Colliculi: A part of the brain that is responsible for processing sensory information and controlling reflexes.\n\nSo, the entities in the paragraph that are related to disease are:\n\n1. GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) - Decreased concentration of GABA in the colliculi is mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Colliculi - The paragraph mentions that the concentration of GABA was only slightly but significantly decreased in the colliculi without modifications in other areas.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are GABA and Colliculi."},
