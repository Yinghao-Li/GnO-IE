Heart failure (HF): The paragraph mentions \"moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction,\" which indicates that the heart is not pumping blood as effectively as it should be.\n3. Torsades de pointes (TS): The paragraph mentions \"wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS,\" which is a type of arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm) that can be caused by a variety of factors, including heart disease.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Coronary artery disease (CAD)\n* Heart failure (HF)\n* Torsades de pointes (TS)"},

TS - an abbreviation for \"takotsubo syndrome,\" a condition also known as \"stress cardiomyopathy\" or \"broken heart syndrome\"\n7. wall motion abnormalities - referring to changes in the way the heart muscle is contracting and relaxing, which can be seen on an echocardiogram or other imaging tests.\n\nI hope that helps!
