However, we can identify some potential disease entities that could be relevant to the context:\n\n1. Drug addiction: The paragraph mentions \"drug-related deaths,\" which suggests that the text is referring to deaths caused by drug addiction or overdose.\n2. Overdose: The term \"overdose\" is often used interchangeably with \"drug-related deaths.\" An overdose occurs when a person takes more of a drug than their body can handle, leading to serious health complications or death.\n3. Substance abuse: The paragraph's focus on \"drug-related deaths\" implies that the text is referring to deaths caused by substance abuse or misuse.\n\nTherefore, the potential disease entities in this paragraph are drug addiction, overdose, and substance abuse."},
