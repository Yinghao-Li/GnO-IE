FSGS: FSGS is a type of kidney disease characterized by scarring of the glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n2. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): ESRD is the final stage of CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease), where the kidneys have failed completely and are no longer able to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n\nIn the paragraph, it is mentioned that the administration of PS (a substance) enhances the toxicity of AMNS (a substance) on the glomerulus and readily produces progressive FSGS in rats, leading to ESRD."},
