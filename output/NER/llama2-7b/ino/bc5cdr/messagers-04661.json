Negative mucosal potential: This is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph as a separate entity, indicating that it is a specific condition or disorder.\n2. Neurological effects of NSAIDs: The paragraph mentions the central and peripheral effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can include neurological side effects such as headache, dizziness, and gastrointestinal disturbances. While these are not separate disease entities in and of themselves, they are potential adverse effects of NSAIDs that can affect the nervous system.\n3. Gastrointestinal effects of NSAIDs: Similarly, the paragraph mentions the central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs, which can include gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. While these are not separate disease entities, they are potential adverse effects of NSAIDs that can affect the gastrointestinal system.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
