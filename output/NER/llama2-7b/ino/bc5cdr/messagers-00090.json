Coronary artery disease (CAD): This is a condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become narrowed or blocked, leading to inadequate blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart muscle.\n2. Myocardial stunning: This is a condition where the heart muscle becomes damaged or stunned due to a lack of oxygen supply, leading to impaired contractility and relaxation of the heart muscle fibers. It is often seen in patients with CAD."},
