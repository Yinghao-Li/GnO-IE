Ventricular rate: This refers to the number of times the ventricles of the heart contract per minute. In this case, the ventricular rate is 70 beats per minute.\n3. Nifedipine: This is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders, including atrial flutter.\n4.
