Myocardial disease: The paragraph mentions \"myocardial t1/2,\" which refers to the half-life of a substance in the myocardium, a type of muscle tissue in the heart. This suggests that the substance being studied has an effect on the heart muscle.\n2. Heart disease: The paragraph specifically mentions \"heart,\" suggesting that the substance being studied has an effect on the heart.\n3. Ischemia: The paragraph mentions \"cumulative dose,\" which refers to the total amount of a substance that has been administered over a period of time. This suggests that the substance being studied may cause ischemia, or a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle.\n4. Infarction: The paragraph mentions \"I-131 HA,\" which is a radioactive isotope used in medical imaging. The use of this isotope suggests that the substance being studied may cause infarction, or the death of heart muscle tissue due to lack of blood flow.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myocardial disease\n2. Heart disease\n3. Ischemia\n4. Infarction"},
