Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is \"yellow phosphorus poisoning.\"\n2. Identify the key terms related to the topic: The key terms related to yellow phosphorus poisoning are \"cholestatic,\" \"presentation,\" and \"poisoning.\"\n3. Identify the entities associated with the key terms:\n * \"Cholestatic\" can be associated with the entity \"Liver disease\" or \"Cholestasis.\"\n * \"Presentation\" can be associated with the entity \"Symptoms.\"\n * \"Poisoning\" can be associated with the entity \"Toxicity.\"\n4. Identify the relationships between the entities:\n * \"Liver disease\" or \"Cholestasis\" is a possible cause of \"Cholestatic presentation.\"\n * \"Symptoms\" are the manifestations of \"Poisoning.\"\n * \"Toxicity\" is the result of \"Poisoning.\"\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Liver disease or Cholestasis\n* Toxicity\n\nI hope this helps!
