However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that are related to disease:\n\n1. Hemodynamics: The paragraph mentions \"little haemodynamic change,\" which refers to the movement of blood in the body. Hemodynamics is the study of blood flow and its regulation in the body.\n2. Pretreatment: The paragraph also mentions the \"pretreatment group,\" which implies that there is a group of individuals who have undergone some form of treatment or preparation before the study.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to disease in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
