Paranoia: This is the main phenomenon being studied, which refers to a mental disorder characterized by irrational and persistent feelings of mistrust and suspicion towards others.\n2. 5HT3 receptor: This is a type of serotonin receptor that is mentioned as being involved in the mechanism of paranoia.\n3. Dopamine: This is a neurotransmitter that is also mentioned as being involved in the mechanism of paranoia, specifically through the action of 5HT3 receptors.\n4. Beta-noradrenergic receptor: This is another type of receptor that is mentioned as being involved in the mechanism of paranoia, specifically through downregulation.\n5. GABAB receptor: This is another type of receptor that is mentioned as being involved in the mechanism of paranoia, specifically through upregulation.\n\nSo, in summary, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are paranoia, 5HT3 receptor, dopamine, beta-noradrenergic receptor, and GABAB receptor."},
