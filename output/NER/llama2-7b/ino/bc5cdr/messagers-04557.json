Hepatitis B: The term \"hepatitis B\" refers to a group of viral infections that affect the liver. Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and can lead to acute or chronic liver disease.\n2. Hepatitis B e: Hepatitis B e is a subtype of hepatitis B that is characterized by the presence of the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in the blood. HBeAg is a protein produced by the HBV virus and is a marker of active infection.\n3. Aminotransferase: Aminotransferase is an enzyme that is found in the liver and is used to diagnose liver disease. Elevated levels of aminotransferase in the blood can indicate liver damage or disease.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph is mentioning the \"Disease\" entities of hepatitis B and hepatitis B e, as well as the biomarker aminotransferase."},
