Proteinuria: This refers to the presence of protein in the urine, which can be an indicator of kidney damage or disease.\n2. Glomerular planar area: This refers to the size or shape of the glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n3. Renal cortical malondialdehyde content: This refers to the level of a chemical called malondialdehyde in the outer layer of the kidneys, which can be an indicator of oxidative stress and inflammation in the kidneys.\n4. Glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage: This refers to damage to the glomeruli or the tubules in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney disease or failure.\n\nI hope this helps!
