Pupil dilation: This is the specific medical procedure mentioned in the paragraph, where the pupils are dilated using tropicamide 1%.\n2. Visual function: This is a broader term that refers to the ability to see and interpret visual information. The paragraph mentions tests on various parameters of visual function to evaluate the effects of pupil dilation.\n3. Driving simulator performance: This is another broader term that refers to the ability to operate a vehicle safely and effectively. The paragraph mentions driving simulator performance to evaluate the effects of pupil dilation on driving ability.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Pupil dilation\n2. Visual function\n3. Driving simulator performance"},
