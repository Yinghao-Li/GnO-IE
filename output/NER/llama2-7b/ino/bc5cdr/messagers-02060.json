Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is \"seizures\".\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * CCR2 (a protein)\n * cell types (plural)\n3. Determine whether each entity is a disease or not:\n * CCR2: No, CCR2 is a protein, not a disease.\n * cell types: No, cell types are not diseases, they are types of cells.\n4. Conclude: The only entity in the paragraph that is a disease is \"seizures\".\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Seizures"},
