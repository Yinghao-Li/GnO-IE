It is a medical condition characterized by an abnormal increase in the levels of nitrogen-containing waste products in the blood, such as serum creatinine and BUN (blood urea nitrogen).\n2. Serum creatinine: This is a specific measure of the level of creatinine in the blood, which is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism. In the paragraph, the reference range for serum creatinine is given as greater than 2.5 mg/dL.\n3. BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen): This is another specific measure of the level of urea nitrogen in the blood, which is also a waste product produced by muscle metabolism. In the paragraph, the reference range for BUN is given as greater than 50 mg/dL."},
