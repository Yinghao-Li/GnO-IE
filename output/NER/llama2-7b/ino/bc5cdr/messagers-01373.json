Copper: This is the metal that accumulates in the body due to the genetic mutation in Wilson's disease.\n2. Metabolism: This refers to the chemical processes that occur in the body to break down and convert nutrients into energy and other compounds. In the context of Wilson's disease, it refers to the metabolism of copper.\n3. Hepatocytes: These are cells in the liver that are involved in the metabolism of copper.\n4. Neurological disorders: These are disorders that affect the nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. In Wilson's disease, copper accumulation in the brain can lead to neurological problems.\n5. Psychiatric disorders: These are disorders that affect a person's mental health and behavior. In Wilson's disease, copper accumulation in the brain can also lead to psychiatric problems.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
