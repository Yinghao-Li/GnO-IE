Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * hypotensive effect\n * baseline blood pressure\n * fluctuating patients\n * stable patients\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * hypotensive effect: effect\n * baseline blood pressure: blood pressure\n * fluctuating patients: patients\n * stable patients: patients\n3. Determine which nouns refer to a disease or medical condition:\n * hypotensive effect: refers to a medical condition (hypotension)\n * baseline blood pressure: refers to a medical condition (hypertension)\n * fluctuating patients: refers to a medical condition (hypertension)\n * stable patients: refers to a medical condition (hypertension)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypotension\n* Hypertension"},
