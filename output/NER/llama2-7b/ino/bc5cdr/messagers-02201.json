To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Hyperprolactinemia\" is a disease entity, which refers to an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood.\n2. \"Loss of prolactin response\" is a disease entity, which refers to a decrease in the ability of the pituitary gland to respond to verapamil stimulation.\n3. \"Anatomic or functional stalk effect\" is a disease entity, which refers to a problem with the structure or function of the pituitary gland, including the stalk that connects the gland to the hypothalamus.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hyperprolactinemia\n2. Loss of prolactin response\n3. Anatomic or functional stalk effect"},

It is produced by the pituitary gland and plays a role in lactation and other physiological processes.\n3.
