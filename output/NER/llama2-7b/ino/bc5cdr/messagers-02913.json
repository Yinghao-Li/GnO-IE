Subacute combined degeneration\n\nExplanation: Subacute combined degeneration is a condition that affects the spine, causing degenerative changes in the discs and vertebrae. It is characterized by a combination of factors, including aging, injury, and genetic predisposition.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
