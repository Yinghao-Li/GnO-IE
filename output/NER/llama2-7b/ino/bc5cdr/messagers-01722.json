Losartan: This is a chemical drug that is administered to the mice in the study. It is mentioned as \"losartan (10 mg/kg/b.w./day by gavages)\" which means that the mice are given a dose of 10 milligrams of losartan per kilogram of body weight per day through gavage (a method of administering medication orally through a tube inserted into the stomach).\n2. ADR: This is another chemical drug that is administered to the mice in the study. It is mentioned as \"group ADR + LOS (6)\" and \"group ADR + LOS (12)\" which suggests that there are two different groups of mice receiving different doses of ADR.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
