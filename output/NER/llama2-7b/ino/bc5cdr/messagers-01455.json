Heart failure: This is a broader term that refers to a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It can be caused by various factors, including acute heart failure.\n3. MAP: This stands for \"Maximum Aerobic Power,\" which is a measure of the highest level of oxygen consumption during exercise.
