Identify the noun phrases:\n * Insulin sensitivity index\n * Insulin resistance\n * Disease\n2. Identify the adjectives:\n * Significant\n * Significant insulin resistance\n * Disease\n3. Identify the verbs:\n * Exhibiting\n * Compared\n * Treated\n4. Identify the subjects:\n * Subjects\n * Groups\n5. Identify the objects:\n * Insulin sensitivity index\n * Olanzapine\n * Risperidone\n\nBased on these identifications, we can conclude that the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Insulin resistance\n* Disease\n\nThe paragraph suggests that there is a significant difference in insulin sensitivity index among groups of people, with subjects who received clozapine and olanzapine exhibiting insulin resistance compared to subjects who were treated with risperidone."},
