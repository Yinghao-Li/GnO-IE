Polygraph: This term is not a disease entity, but rather a medical device used to measure physiological signals, such as breathing patterns.\n2. Custom software: This term is not a disease entity, but rather a software application that is used to analyze and process the data collected from the polygraph.\n3. Ventilation (VE): This is a disease entity, as it refers to the process of exchanging gases in the lungs, which can be affected by various respiratory diseases.\n4. Tidal volume (VT): This is a disease entity, as it refers to the amount of air moved in and out of the lungs during each breath, which can be affected by respiratory diseases such as pneumonia or COPD.\n5. Inspiratory time (TI): This is a disease entity, as it refers to the time it takes to inhale a breath, which can be affected by respiratory diseases such as asthma.\n6. Expiratory time (TE): This is a disease entity, as it refers to the time it takes to exhale a breath, which can be affected by respiratory diseases such as COPD.\n7. Breathing frequency (f): This is a disease entity, as it refers to the number of breaths taken per minute, which can be affected by various respiratory diseases.\n8. Mean inspiratory flow (VT / TI): This is a disease entity, as it refers to the average rate at which air moves in and out of the lungs during inhalation, which can be affected by respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."},

Differential pressure transducer - This is a device that measures pressure differences, which can be related to changes in fluid flow or volume.\n2. Polygraph - This is a device that measures the flow of a fluid, such as air or gas, through a system.\n3. Custom software - This is a software program that is specifically designed for a particular purpose or application, in this case, to analyze the data from the differential pressure transducer and polygraph.\n4. Ventilation (VE) - This is a measure of the volume of air or gas that is moved into or out of the lungs during a specific time period.\n5. Tidal volume (VT) - This is the volume of air or gas that is moved into or out of the lungs during a single breath.\n6. Inspiratory time (TI) - This is the time it takes to inhale a breath.\n7. Expiratory time (TE) - This is the time it takes to exhale a breath.\n8. Breathing frequency (f) - This is the number of breaths per minute.\n9. Mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) - This is a measure of the average rate at which air or gas is moved into the lungs during inspiration.\n\nNote that some of these entities are not strictly chemical in nature, but they are related to the measurement and analysis of fluid flow and breathing patterns, which are chemical processes."},
