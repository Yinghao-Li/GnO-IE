QT prolongation: This is a heart rhythm disorder characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG). It can increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes, a potentially life-threatening condition.\n2. Bradycardia: This is a condition where the heart rate is abnormally slow, less than 60 beats per minute. It can cause symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and fainting.\n3. Dizziness: This is a symptom characterized by a feeling of lightheadedness or wooziness. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including inner ear problems, medication side effects, or low blood pressure.\n4. General fatigue: This is a symptom characterized by a feeling of tiredness or weakness. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including lack of sleep, stress, or underlying medical conditions.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are QT prolongation, bradycardia, dizziness, and general fatigue."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Chemical\" entities:\n\n1. QT prolongation: This is a cardiac electrophysiology parameter that refers to the prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG). QT prolongation can be caused by various factors, including certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, and genetic disorders.\n2. Bradycardia: This is a medical condition characterized by a slow heart rate, typically defined as a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute. Bradycardia can be caused by various factors, including heart rate variability, sinus node dysfunction, and medication side effects.\n3. Dizziness: This is a symptom characterized by a feeling of lightheadedness or unsteadiness, often accompanied by a loss of balance or coordination. Dizziness can be caused by various factors, including inner ear problems, medication side effects, and neurological disorders.\n4. General fatigue: This is a symptom characterized by a feeling of tiredness or weakness, often accompanied by a lack of energy or motivation. General fatigue can be caused by various factors, including chronic illness, sleep disorders, and medication side effects.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. QT prolongation (a cardiac electrophysiology parameter)\n2. Bradycardia (a heart rate disorder)\n3. Dizziness (a symptom)\n4. General fatigue (a symptom)"},
