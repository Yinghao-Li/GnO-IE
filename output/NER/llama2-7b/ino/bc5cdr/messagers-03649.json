Cardiotoxicity: This refers to the damage caused to the heart muscle or cardiovascular system due to exposure to certain drugs or other toxic substances.\n2. 5-FU: This is likely a misspelling or abbreviation for the drug 5-fluorouracil, which is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer.\n3. CDDP: This could stand for several different things, including:\n * Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity: This refers to the damage caused to the heart muscle or cardiovascular system due to chemotherapy drugs.\n * Cardiac disease due to chemotherapy (CDDP): This is a broader term that encompasses any type of heart disease that is caused by chemotherapy.\n4. Echocardiography: This is a diagnostic test that uses ultrasound waves to create images of the heart and its structures.\n5. Scintigraphy: This is a diagnostic test that uses small amounts of radioactive material to create images of the heart and its structures.\n\nI hope this helps!
