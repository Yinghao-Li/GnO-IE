Blood: Blood is a fluid that circulates throughout the body and is composed of various chemical components, including proteins, sugars, hormones, and gases.\n2. Pressure: Pressure is a measure of the force exerted on a surface or volume of fluid, and it is often measured in units of pascals (Pa) or millimeters of mercury (mmHg).\n3. Tail: A tail is not a chemical entity, but rather a part of an organism (in this case, a human).\n4. Cuff: A cuff is a device used to measure blood pressure, and it is typically made of a flexible material that can be wrapped around a person's arm or leg.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"blood\"."},
