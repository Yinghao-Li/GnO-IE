Beta-adrenoblocking: This is a term used to describe a type of disease or condition that affects the beta adrenergic receptors in the body. Beta adrenergic receptors are receptors that are activated by the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and play a role in regulating various physiological processes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism.\n2. Membrane-stabilizing action: This term refers to the ability of a compound to stabilize or protect the cell membrane from damage or disruption. This can be important in various diseases or conditions where the cell membrane is compromised or damaged, such as in neurodegenerative disorders or cancer.\n\nSo, in summary, the two \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Beta-adrenoblocking\n2. Membrane-stabilizing action"},
