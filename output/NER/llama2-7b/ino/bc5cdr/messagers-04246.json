It is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause renal damage in some individuals.\n3. Prostaglandin: This is a class of lipid molecules that are involved in a variety of physiological processes, including inflammation and pain. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analogue, meaning it mimics the action of prostaglandins in the body.\n4. Renal: This refers to the kidneys. In this context, \"renal dysfunction\" means that the kidneys are not functioning properly.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
