Diltiazem (chemical name: 1,5-Benzyl-3,3-diphenyl-2-quinuclidinyl-4-methyl-5-oxazolidinone)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is a chemical compound composed of sodium and chlorine atoms. It is commonly used as a solvent and in the production of various chemicals.\n2. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is a chemical compound composed of sodium, carbon, and oxygen atoms. It is commonly used as a buffering agent in pharmaceuticals and in the food industry.\n3. Diltiazem is a chemical compound composed of a benzyl, phenyl, and quinuclidinyl ring system, with a methyl and an oxazolidinone group. It is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and heart failure.\n\nNote that while \"isotonic\" is not a chemical entity, it is a term used to describe the solubility of a substance in a specific solvent, in this case, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and diltiazem."},
