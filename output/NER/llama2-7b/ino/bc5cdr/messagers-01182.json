Angiotensinogen deficiency: The paragraph mentions \"low brain angiotensinogen\" in the transgenic rats, which suggests that they have a deficiency in angiotensinogen, a protein that plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation.\n2. Hypertension: The use of transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen suggests that the researchers are studying a model of hypertension, which is a disease characterized by high blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities identified in this paragraph are:\n\n1. Angiotensinogen deficiency\n2. Hypertension"},
