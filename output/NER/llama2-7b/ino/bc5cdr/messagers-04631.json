    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Hyperprolactinemia: This is a condition where the level of prolactin in the blood is higher than normal. In this paragraph, haloperidol (a medication) causes hyperprolactinemia for 9 months.\n2. Prolactin (PRL): This is the hormone that is produced by the pituitary gland and plays a role in lactation and breast development. The paragraph mentions that there is an extremely high increase in serum PRL levels after the implantation of MMQ cells under the kidney capsule.\n3. Kidney capsule: This refers to the outer layer of the kidney that covers and protects the kidney.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hyperprolactinemia (a condition)\n2. Prolactin (PRL) (a hormone)\n3. Kidney capsule (a structure)"},

Haloperidol: This is a drug that is used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
