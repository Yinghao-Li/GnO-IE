METHODS : - This is a preposition, so it doesn't refer to a chemical entity.\n2. CHX - This is a chemical entity, as it is a specific chemical compound (Chloroquine).\n3. was - This is a verb, so it doesn't refer to a chemical entity.\n4. injected - This is a verb, so it doesn't refer to a chemical entity.\n5. before - This is a preposition, so it doesn't refer to a chemical entity.\n6. the - This is a definite article, so it doesn't refer to a chemical entity.\n7. Pilo - This is a chemical entity, as it is a specific chemical compound (Pilocarpine).\n8. injection - This is a noun, so it refers to a chemical entity (the act of injecting a substance).\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* CHX (Chloroquine)\n* Pilocarpine"},
