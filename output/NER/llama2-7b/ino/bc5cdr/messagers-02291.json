Coronary artery disease: The paragraph mentions that cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries, which suggests that they may be used to treat coronary artery disease.\n2. Myocardial metabolic demand: The paragraph mentions that the effect of cromakalim and pinacidil is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors-mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand, which suggests that these drugs may be used to treat conditions that affect myocardial metabolism.\n\nSo, the two \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
