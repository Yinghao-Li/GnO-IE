Cardiovascular event:\n * Definition: Any event related to the cardiovascular system, such as a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure.\n * Examples: myocardial infarction (heart attack), cerebral infarction (stroke), heart failure, arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm), etc.\n * 0% of patients died of a cardiovascular event during the 30-day follow-up period.\n2. Myocardial infarction:\n * Definition: A type of cardiovascular event where the heart muscle is damaged due to a lack of oxygen, usually caused by a blockage in a coronary artery.\n * Examples: myocardial infarction (heart attack), silent myocardial infarction (a type of heart attack that does not cause obvious symptoms).\n * 0% of patients sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction during the 30-day follow-up period.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cardiovascular event\n* Myocardial infarction"},
