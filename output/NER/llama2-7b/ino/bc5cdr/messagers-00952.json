Clozapine\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Insulin: Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. It is produced by the pancreas and plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body.\n2. Olanzapine: Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication that is used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It works by blocking the action of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, which can help to reduce psychotic symptoms.\n3. Risperidone: Risperidone is another antipsychotic medication that is used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It works by blocking the action of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, which can help to reduce psychotic symptoms.\n4. Clozapine: Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication that is used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It works by blocking the action of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, which can help to reduce psychotic symptoms.\n\nIn the paragraph, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance is compared among different groups, with the results showing significant differences among them. The comparison is made between clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone, with clozapine having the highest insulin resistance, followed by olanzapine and then risperidone."},
