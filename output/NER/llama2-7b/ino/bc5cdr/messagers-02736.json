Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * P9605\n * P9201\n * leukoencephalopathy\n * treatment\n2. Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * patients\n * disease\n * leukoencephalopathy\n * treatment\n3. Identify the adjectives in the paragraph:\n * significantly\n * late\n4. Identify the verbs in the paragraph:\n * developed\n * identified\n5. Based on the nouns, adjectives, and verbs identified in steps 1-4, we can determine that the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n * leukoencephalopathy\n * disease\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"leukoencephalopathy\" and \"disease\"."},
