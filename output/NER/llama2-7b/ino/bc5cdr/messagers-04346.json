Hypertrophic heart: This is a type of heart disease characterized by an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy).\n2. Cardiomyocytes: These are the muscle cells of the heart. In this paragraph, the author is referring to isolated cardiomyocytes, which means they have been removed from the heart and are being studied in isolation.\n3. DNA synthesis: This is a biochemical process that involves the replication of DNA, which is the genetic material of cells. In the context of the paragraph, the author is using autoradiography to assess the amount of DNA synthesis in isolated cardiomyocytes from control (normal) and hypertrophic hearts."},
