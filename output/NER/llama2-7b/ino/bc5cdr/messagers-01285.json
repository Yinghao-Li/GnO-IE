CAA (Cystic Amyloid Amyloidosis) - a disease characterized by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates in organs and tissues.\n2. hRPTEC (human Renal Proximal Tubular Epithelial cells) - a type of cell in the kidney that plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of fluids and electrolytes in the body.\n3. necrosis markers - proteins that are produced in response to cellular injury or death, indicating necrosis (death of cells due to injury or infection).\n\nSo, the paragraph suggests that CAA reduces the number of hRPTEC cells and protein, leads to a loss of free intracellular thiols, and increases the levels of necrosis markers."},
