Lindane: This is the drug or medication being studied, which is mentioned as acting as a non-competitive antagonist at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor.\n2. GABA: This is the neurotransmitter that the drug, lindane, acts on. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps regulate the activity of neurons in the brain.\n3. Antagonist: This is a type of drug that blocks or opposes the action of another drug or substance. In this case, lindane is proposed to act as a non-competitive antagonist at the GABA receptor.\n\nSo, the entities mentioned in the paragraph related to disease are:\n\n1. Lindane (disease or medication)\n2. GABA (neurotransmitter)\n3. Antagonist (type of drug)"},
