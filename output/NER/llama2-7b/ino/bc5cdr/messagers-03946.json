    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Tachycardia: This is the primary disease entity being studied in the paragraph. Tachycardia refers to a rapid heart rate, typically above 100 beats per minute.\n2. Hypertension: The paragraph mentions \"normal subjects,\" which implies that the subjects being studied have normal blood pressure levels. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common disease that can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n3. Cardioselective: Atenolol is described as \"cardioselective,\" which means it acts specifically on the heart rather than on other parts of the body. This suggests that the drug is used to treat cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension or angina.\n4. Nonselective: Propranolol, on the other hand, is described as \"nonselective,\" which means it acts on multiple parts of the body, including the heart, blood vessels, and other organs. This suggests that the drug is used to treat a wider range of conditions, including hypertension, angina, and anxiety disorders.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
