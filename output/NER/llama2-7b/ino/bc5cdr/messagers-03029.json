Amphetamine: It is a drug that is mentioned in the paragraph as being administered to some of the mice. Amphetamine is a highly addictive drug that can cause serious health problems, including cardiovascular issues, respiratory problems, and psychological problems.\n2. DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone): It is a hormone that is mentioned in the paragraph as being administered to some of the mice. DHEA is a hormone that is produced by the adrenal glands and plays a role in the regulation of hormone levels in the body. However, high levels of DHEA can cause a range of health problems, including hormonal imbalances, acne, and mood changes.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
