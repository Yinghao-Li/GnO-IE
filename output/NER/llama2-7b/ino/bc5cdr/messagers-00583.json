To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Plasma concentrations\" - This refers to the levels of a substance (e.g., a drug or toxin) present in the bloodstream.\n2. \"sufficient to result in central nervous system toxicity\" - This suggests that the plasma concentrations were high enough to cause damage to the brain or nervous system.\n3. \"did not produce manifestations of cardiac toxicity\" - This means that the high plasma concentrations did not cause damage to the heart or cardiovascular system.\n\nBased on these clues, we can infer that the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Central nervous system toxicity (e.g., brain damage or neurotoxicity)\n2. Cardiac toxicity (e.g., heart damage or cardiotoxicity)\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are related to the nervous and cardiovascular systems."},

Central nervous system: This is a chemical system that includes the brain and spinal cord, and is responsible for controlling various functions of the body, including thought, movement, and sensation.\n4. Toxicity: This is a chemical term that refers to the degree to which a substance is harmful or toxic to living organisms.\n5.
