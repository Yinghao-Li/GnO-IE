Hypertension: This is the disease entity that is caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Hypertension is a condition where the blood pressure is elevated, which can lead to serious health problems if left untreated.\n2. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): These are the drugs that are mentioned in the paragraph as having the potential to cause hypertension. SSRIs are a class of medications that are used to treat depression, anxiety, and other conditions by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain.\n3.
