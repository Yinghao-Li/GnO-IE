Brain: This is a general term for the organ that serves as the center of the nervous system, including the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).\n2. Noradrenergic: This refers to the noradrenaline system, which is a group of neurons and neurotransmitters that play a role in regulating various physiological and psychological processes, including mood, arousal, and cognitive function.\n3. Locomotor: This refers to the ability to move or walk.\n4. Stimulant: This refers to a type of drug that stimulates the central nervous system and can produce effects such as increased alertness, energy, and improved concentration.\n5. Amphetamine: This is a specific drug that is commonly used as a stimulant and is known to have effects on the brain and nervous system.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
