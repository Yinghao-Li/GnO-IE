This type of design is useful when it is not possible or practical to collect new data, or when the research question is too complex to be addressed in a single study. The data used in a retrospective case series can come from a variety of sources, including electronic health records, medical charts, and administrative databases. The data are typically analyzed using statistical methods to identify patterns or trends, and the results are presented in a narrative or graphical format.\n\nIn this paragraph, the following \"Chemical\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1.
