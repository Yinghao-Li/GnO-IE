Generalised seizures - This is a type of seizure that affects the entire brain.\n2. Focal seizures - This is a type of seizure that affects only one part of the brain.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Generalised seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can be due to various chemical imbalances or other factors.\n* Focal seizures, on the other hand, are caused by abnormal electrical activity in a specific part of the brain, which can also be due to chemical imbalances or other factors.\n\nTherefore, both generalised and focal seizures are considered \"Chemical\" entities in this context, as they are related to the chemical imbalances or other factors that affect the brain's electrical activity."},
