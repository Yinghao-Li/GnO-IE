Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) - a enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) into 5-fluoro-β-alanine (FBAL).\n2. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) - a chemotherapy drug that is metabolized by DPD, but its metabolism can be inhibited by S-1, leading to increased levels of 5-FU in the body.\n3. 5-Fluoro-β-alanine (FBAL) - a metabolite of 5-FU that is produced by the degradation of 5-FU by DPD.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency - a condition in which the enzyme DPD is deficient or defective, leading to the accumulation of 5-FU in the body.\n2. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) toxicity - a condition in which the levels of 5-FU in the body are elevated, leading to adverse effects.\n\nNote: These disease entities are identified based on the information provided in the paragraph, and may not be exhaustive or definitive."},
