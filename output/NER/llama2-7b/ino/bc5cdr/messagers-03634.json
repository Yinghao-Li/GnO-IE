Neurotoxicity refers to the harmful effects of a substance on the nervous system. In this context, the investigation is focused on determining whether theophylline (a drug used to treat asthma and other respiratory conditions) has altered neurotoxicity in advanced pregnancy.\n2. Advanced pregnancy refers to the later stages of pregnancy, beyond the first trimester. In this investigation, the researchers are specifically interested in studying the effects of theophylline on the nervous system in pregnant women who are further along in their pregnancy."},
