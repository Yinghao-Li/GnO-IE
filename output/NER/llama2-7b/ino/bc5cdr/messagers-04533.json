Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Animals\n * S - I group\n * E - I group\n * isoproterenol\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Animals (Disease)\n * S - I group (Disease)\n * E - I group (Disease)\n * isoproterenol (Medication)\n3. Determine if each noun is a disease or a medication:\n * Animals (Disease)\n * S - I group (Disease)\n * E - I group (Disease)\n * isoproterenol (Medication)\n4. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n * S - I group\n * E - I group\n\nSo, the two diseases mentioned in the paragraph are \"S - I group\" and \"E - I group\"."},
