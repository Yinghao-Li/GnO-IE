Chest pain - This is the symptom that led to the patients' referral for cardiac catheterization.\n2. Heart disease - The paragraph mentions measuring heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, and LV pressure, which are all related to heart function and could indicate heart disease.\n3. Cardiovascular disease - The paragraph mentions cardiac catheterization, which is a diagnostic procedure used to evaluate the heart and its blood vessels, and could imply that the patients have cardiovascular disease.\n4. Hypertension - The paragraph mentions measuring systemic arterial pressure, which could indicate hypertension (high blood pressure).\n5. Heart failure - The paragraph mentions measuring LV pressure and ejection fraction, which are related to heart function and could indicate heart failure.\n\nI hope this helps!
