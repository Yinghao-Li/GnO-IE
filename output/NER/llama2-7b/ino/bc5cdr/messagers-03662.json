Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"induced hypotension\" - no chemical entities mentioned\n2. \"sympathetic efferent activity\" - sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is a system of nerves that transmit signals from the central nervous system (CNS) to various organs in the body. The SNS is involved in the \"fight or flight\" response and is responsible for increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological responses to stress.\n3. \"vagal efferent activity\" - vagus nerve is a cranial nerve that transmits signals from the CNS to various organs in the body, including the heart, lungs, and digestive system. The vagus nerve is involved in various physiological processes, including regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* sympathetic nervous system (SNS)\n* vagus nerve (VN)"},
