HL60 cells: This is a type of cancer cell line that is commonly used in research to study the effects of drugs and other compounds on cell growth and division.\n2. HBMP cells: This is an abbreviation for \"human bone marrow progenitor cells\". Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside some of your bones, such as your hips and thighbones. It contains immature cells that develop into blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, the authors are studying the ability of remoxipride and other compounds to induce apoptosis (cell death) in cancer cells (HL60 cells) and immature blood cells (HBMP cells)."},
