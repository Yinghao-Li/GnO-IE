Thrombectomy: A thrombectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a blood clot or thrombus from a blood vessel. In this case, the paragraph mentions a \"percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy,\" which is a minimally invasive procedure performed through the skin.\n2. Cerebral Disease (CDT): CDT stands for cerebral disease thrombectomy, which is a type of surgical procedure used to treat cerebral thrombosis, or the formation of a blood clot in the brain.\n3. Stroke: The paragraph mentions \"epistaxis,\" which is a symptom of stroke. Stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is interrupted, leading to a lack of blood flow to the brain.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Thrombectomy\n2. Cerebral Disease (CDT)\n3. Stroke"},
