Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * Microglia\n * Disease\n * Transformation\n * Group\n * Prefrontal cortex\n * Striatum\n * Hippocampus\n2. Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Magnitude of transformation\n * Number of intersections\n * Moderate dose\n * High dose\n * Controls\n3. Identify the verbs in the paragraph:\n * Assessed\n * Significantly\n * Increased\n * Not\n4. Identify the adjectives in the paragraph:\n * Moderate\n * High\n * Controls\n5. Based on the above analysis, we can identify the disease entities in the paragraph as:\n * Microglia (mentioned as the entity being transformed)\n * Disease (mentioned as the cause of the transformation)\n * Transformation (the process or change occurring in the microglia)\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"Microglia\" and \"Disease\"."},

High dose: Similar to moderate dose, this refers to a higher amount or concentration of a substance.\n3. Controls: This refers to a group of individuals or samples that are used as a reference or baseline for comparison.
