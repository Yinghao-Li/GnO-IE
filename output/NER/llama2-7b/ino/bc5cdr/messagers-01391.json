It is not a disease entity, but rather a substance that was used to induce the lesions.\n3. \"bilateral microinjections\" - This is a method of delivering the N - methyl - D - aspartic acid to the brain. It is not a disease entity, but rather a technique used to administer the substance.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is \"lesions\"."},
