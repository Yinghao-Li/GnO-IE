Hypertension: This is mentioned in the paragraph as the disease that the new dihydrothienopyridine calcium antagonist, S-312-d, is being studied for.\n2. Calcium antagonism: The paragraph mentions that S-312-d is a dihydrothienopyridine calcium antagonist, which suggests that it works by blocking the activity of calcium in the body. This can be a potential treatment for certain diseases, such as hypertension.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypertension\n2. Calcium antagonism"},
