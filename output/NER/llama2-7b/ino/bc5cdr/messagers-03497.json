Adrenaline: This is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that helps to increase heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration in response to stress or other stimuli.\n2. Noradrenaline: This is another hormone produced by the adrenal gland that has similar effects to adrenaline, but is more specifically involved in the \"fight or flight\" response.\n3. Dextrose solution: This is a solution of glucose (a type of sugar) that is used as a nutrient infusion in medical treatment.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
