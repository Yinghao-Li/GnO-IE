QT prolongation: This is a medical condition where the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is longer than normal. It can be caused by various factors, including certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, and genetic disorders.\n2. Hypocalcaemia: This is a condition where the level of calcium in the blood is lower than normal. Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, including muscle contraction, nerve function, and bone health. Hypocalcaemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism (a condition where the parathyroid glands do not produce enough parathyroid hormone), and certain medications."},
