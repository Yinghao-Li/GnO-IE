Renal amyloidosis: This is a condition where abnormal proteins accumulate in the kidneys and can lead to kidney damage and dysfunction.\n2. SVC syndrome (Suspicion of Vasculitis): SVC syndrome is a condition where there is inflammation in the blood vessels, particularly in the superior vena cava, which can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the face and neck.\n3. HITT (Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome): HITT is a condition where there is damage to the red blood cells, leading to anemia, kidney damage, and a risk of stroke.\n4. Argatroban: Argatroban is a medication used to treat blood clots and prevent further clotting.\n5. CDT (Catheter Direct Thrombolysis): CDT is a procedure where a catheter is inserted into the affected blood vessel and a clot-busting drug is delivered directly to the clot to break it up.\n6.
