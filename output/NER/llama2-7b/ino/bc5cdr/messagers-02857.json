Sleep: Sleep is a physiological state characterized by reduced consciousness, slower reactions, and decreased physical activity. It is a complex process that involves the release and regulation of various chemicals in the brain, such as neurotransmitters and hormones.\n2. Interference: Interference refers to the disruption or obstruction of a chemical reaction or process.
