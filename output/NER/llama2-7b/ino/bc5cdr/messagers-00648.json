Dopamine: The paragraph mentions \"advanced Parkinson's disease,\" which is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motor control and other functions.\n2. Substance P: The paragraph mentions \"bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation,\" which is a surgical procedure that involves stimulating the subthalamic nucleus, a structure in the brain that contains dopamine and substance P. Substance P is a chemical neurotransmitter that is involved in pain modulation and other functions.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are dopamine and substance P."},
