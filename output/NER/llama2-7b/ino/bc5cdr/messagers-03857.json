Acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity: This refers to the damage caused to the kidneys as a result of taking too much acetaminophen.\n2. Nephrotoxicity: This is a broader term that refers to any type of damage or injury to the kidneys.\n3. P - aminophenol: This is a specific compound that is mentioned in the paragraph as being involved in the study of acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity.\n4.

It is the compound that is being metabolized by the liver into a toxic metabolite, which can cause nephrotoxicity.\n3. Bis (p-nitrophenyl) phosphate: This is a chemical compound that is used as a metabolic intermediate in the metabolism of acetaminophen. It is formed when acetaminophen is metabolized by the liver into a toxic metabolite.\n4. Fischer 344 rats: This is a type of rat that is used in scientific research.
