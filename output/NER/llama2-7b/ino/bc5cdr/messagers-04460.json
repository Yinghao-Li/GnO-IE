Famotidine: This is the drug being discussed in the paragraph, which is a type of H2-receptor antagonist used to treat various conditions such as ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\n2. H2-receptor antagonist: This is a class of drugs that work by blocking the action of histamine on the stomach, which can help to reduce acid production and relieve symptoms of acid reflux. Famotidine is an example of an H2-receptor antagonist.\n3. Histamine: This is a chemical messenger that is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of stomach acid production. H2-receptor antagonists, such as famotidine, work by blocking the action of histamine on the stomach.\n4. Acid: This is a general term for any substance that is capable of dissolving a base, such as hydrochloric acid, which is produced in the stomach to help digest food. The production of stomach acid is regulated by histamine and other chemical messengers, and H2-receptor antagonists can help to reduce acid production.\n\nI hope this helps!
