Dopamine: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including movement, motivation, and reward processing.\n2. Agonist: An agonist is a chemical that binds to a receptor and activates it, leading to a biological response. In the context of the paragraph, the dopamine agonist is a chemical that activates dopamine receptors.\n3. Placebo: Placebo is a substance that has no active therapeutic effect but can produce a positive response in a patient due to psychological or social factors.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are dopamine, agonist, and placebo."},
