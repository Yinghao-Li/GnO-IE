Cocaine: This is a psychoactive drug that is known to induce hyperactivity.\n2. Adenosine: Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating various physiological processes, including sleep, arousal, and heart rate. In the context of the paragraph, adenosine receptor agonists are mentioned, which suggests that adenosine itself or a compound that mimics its action is being referred to.\n3.
