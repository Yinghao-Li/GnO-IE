It refers to a specific type of pain sensitivity that is caused by an underlying condition, in this case, glutamate injection.\n2. \"Visual analogue scale (VAS)\" is a disease entity. It is a tool used to measure pain intensity, and in this case, it is used to measure the increase in pain sensitivity after glutamate injection.\n3. \"Pain\" is a disease entity. It is the primary symptom being studied in the paragraph, and it is the response to the glutamate injection.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Secondary pinprick hyperalgesia\n* Visual analogue scale (VAS)\n* Pain\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

It is a type of neurotransmitter that plays a role in transmitting signals in the nervous system.\n2. Von Frey gauges: These are tools used to measure the sensitivity of an animal's skin to touch. They consist of a series of calibrated filaments of increasing thickness, which are used to apply gentle pressure to the skin and measure the response.\n3. Visual analogue scale (VAS): This is a tool used to measure a subjective experience or sensation, such as pain. It consists of a continuous line with a mark at one end indicating no pain and a mark at the other end indicating the most intense possible pain. The subject is asked to indicate their level of pain by marking the point on the line that best represents their experience.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
