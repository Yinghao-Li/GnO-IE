STZ (Streptozotocin) - a toxic substance used to induce diabetes in experimental animals.\n2. Diabetes - a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* STZ is a toxic substance that is used to induce diabetes in experimental animals. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n* Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels, and it is the disease that STZ is used to model in experimental settings."},
