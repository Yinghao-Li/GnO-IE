This suggests that the disease entity being referred to is a neurological disorder or condition.\n2.

This implies that hemodialysis is a disease entity being referred to, as it is a medical treatment used to remove waste products from the blood when the kidneys are not functioning properly.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.

Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis is a medical procedure that uses a machine to filter the blood when the kidneys are not able to do so. It is a chemical process that involves the use of dialysate solution to remove waste products and excess fluids from the blood.\n2. Flux: Flux refers to the rate at which a chemical reaction occurs. In the context of hemodialysis, the flux of the dialysate solution through the bloodstream is important in removing waste products.\n3. Dialysate solution: Dialysate solution is a chemical solution used in hemodialysis to remove waste products and excess fluids from the blood. It is a mixture of chemicals that are designed to mimic the functions of the kidneys.\n4. Waste products: Waste products are chemicals that are produced in the body and need to be removed through the kidneys or other means. In the context of hemodialysis, the waste products are removed from the blood through the dialysate solution.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
