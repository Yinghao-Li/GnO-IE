To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Chronic CYP administration\" - This is a treatment or condition that the researchers are studying. \"CYP\" is likely an abbreviation for a specific disease or condition, which we will identify later.\n2. \"significantly ( P < or = . 002 ) increased bladder weight\" - This sentence tells us that the treatment (CYP) caused a significant increase in the weight of the bladder.\n3. \"increased ( 7 - to 11 - fold ) the numbers of NOS - immunoreactive ( IR ) afferent neurons in the L6 - S1 DRG\" - This sentence tells us that the treatment (CYP) caused an increase in the number of certain nerve cells (afferent neurons) in the L6-S1 dorsal root ganglion (DRG).\n\nBased on these sentences, we can identify the following disease entities:\n\n1. CYP (Chronic Cyclophosphamide Administration) - This is the disease or condition being studied in the paragraph.\n2. Bladder weight - The weight of the bladder is affected by the treatment (CYP).\n3. NOS - immunoreactive (IR) afferent neurons - These are the nerve cells that are affected by the treatment (CYP) in the L6-S1 DRG.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Chronic Cyclophosphamide Administration (CYP)\n2. Bladder weight\n3. NOS-immunoreactive (IR) afferent neurons"},
