Diabetes mellitus (a disease characterized by high blood sugar levels)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Insulin resistance: The paragraph mentions that patients taking clozapine and olanzapine must be examined for insulin resistance and its consequences. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. Insulin resistance can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n2. Diabetes mellitus: The paragraph mentions the consequences of insulin resistance, which include diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels. There are two main types of diabetes mellitus: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is caused by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, while type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion."},
