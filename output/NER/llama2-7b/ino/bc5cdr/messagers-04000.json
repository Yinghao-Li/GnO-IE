To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Atrial thrombosis\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the formation of a blood clot within the heart's atrium.\n2. \"involving the heart\" - This is a prepositional phrase that modifies the disease entity \"atrial thrombosis.\" It provides additional information about the location of the clot within the heart.\n3. \"F - 344 rats\" - This is a specific strain of rat, which is likely used as a model organism in scientific research. It is not a disease entity.\n4. \"ingesting quinacrine hydrochloride\" - This is also a specific action or event, as it describes the rats' behavior. It is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is \"atrial thrombosis.\""},
