Pain: The paragraph mentions \"pain intensity score\" (DPI), which implies that the study is focused on measuring the intensity of pain experienced by patients. Therefore, \"pain\" can be considered a disease entity.\n\n2. DPI (Difference in Pain Intensity): As the name suggests, DPI is a measure of the difference in pain intensity between two or more groups of patients. While it is not a disease entity itself, it is a measure used to quantify the difference in pain intensity between different groups, which can be an indicator of a disease or condition."},

Pain: Pain is a physical sensation caused by stimulation of specialized nerve endings, and it is a common symptom of many medical conditions.\n2. Intensity: Pain intensity is a measure of the severity of pain, often measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 10 or using other rating scales.\n3.
