Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Neither\n * propranolol\n * B 24 / 76\n * changes\n * characteristic\n * myosin\n * isoenzyme\n * pattern\n * heart\n2. Identify the noun phrases that refer to a disease or medical condition:\n * hypertrophied rat heart (a disease or medical condition)\n3. Identify the entities that are associated with the disease or medical condition:\n * hypertrophied rat heart (the disease or medical condition)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypertrophied rat heart (the disease or medical condition)"},
