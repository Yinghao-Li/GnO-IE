PUT (Putnam)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Carbimazole: Carbimazole is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat certain autoimmune disorders, including Graves' disease and toxic thyroiditis. It is an antithyroid drug that works by blocking the production of thyroid hormones.\n2. Methimazole: Methimazole is another chemical compound that is used as an antithyroid medication to treat hyperthyroidism, which is a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. It works by blocking the production of thyroid hormones.\n3. PUT (Putnam): PUT is not a chemical entity, but rather a proper noun referring to a person (Dr. Putnam). It is not a chemical compound or medication."},
