Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Higher plasma ammonium levels\n * Bacterial infections\n * Hyperammonemia\n * 5-FU (5-fluorouracil)\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Higher plasma ammonium levels: plasma, ammonium\n * Bacterial infections: bacterial infections\n * Hyperammonemia: hyperammonemia\n * 5-FU: 5-FU\n3. Determine whether each noun is a disease entity or not:\n * Plasma: Not a disease entity (a component of blood)\n * Ammonium: Not a disease entity (a chemical compound)\n * Bacterial infections: Yes, a disease entity (a type of infection caused by bacteria)\n * Hyperammonemia: Yes, a disease entity (a type of metabolic disorder)\n * 5-FU: Not a disease entity (a chemotherapy drug)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Bacterial infections\n* Hyperammonemia"},
