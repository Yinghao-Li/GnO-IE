Nonaspirin analgesic drugs: This refers to a class of drugs that are used to relieve pain but do not contain aspirin. Examples of nonaspirin analgesics include acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen.\n2. NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs): This refers to a class of drugs that are used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.\n3.
