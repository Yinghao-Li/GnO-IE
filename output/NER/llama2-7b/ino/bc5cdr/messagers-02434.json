Rabbit: The paragraph mentions \"rabbit's lymphocytes,\" indicating that the study involves a disease or disorder affecting rabbits.\n2. Lymphocytes: Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system. In this context, the paragraph mentions \"lymphocytes\" as the cells that are being studied.\n3. In vivo: This term refers to a biological process or experiment that takes place inside a living organism, in this case, the rabbit.\n4. In vitro: This term refers to a biological process or experiment that takes place outside of a living organism, in a controlled laboratory setting.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Rabbit (disease or disorder)\n2. Lymphocytes (disease or disorder)\n\nNote that the term \"disease\" is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but the context suggests that the study is focused on understanding the effects of IFO and Mesna on the immune system of a living organism, which implies that there is a disease or disorder being studied."},
