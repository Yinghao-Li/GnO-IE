It is a chemical concept used in statistics and data analysis.\n2. h - h is a chemical symbol for the unit of time, \"hour\".\n3. [range] - The square brackets indicate a range of values, which is a chemical concept used to represent a range of values in a dataset or a mathematical expression.\n4. [1-216] - The range of values within the square brackets represents a chemical concentration range, which is a common chemical concept used to express the concentration of a substance in a solution or mixture.\n5.
