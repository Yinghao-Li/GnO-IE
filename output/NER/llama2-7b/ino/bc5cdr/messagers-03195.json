However, based on the context, we can identify the following potential disease entities:\n\n1. Renal disease: The paragraph mentions that the patient's renal function remained unaffected, which suggests that the patient may have a disease that affects the kidneys.\n2. Nephrology: The term \"renal\" refers to the kidneys, which are studied in the field of nephrology. Therefore, the paragraph may be referring to a disease related to the kidneys or nephrology.\n3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): CKD is a common disease that affects the kidneys over time, leading to gradual loss of kidney function. The paragraph's mention of unaffected renal function could suggest that the patient has CKD.\n4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): AKI is a sudden and temporary loss of kidney function that can occur due to various causes. The paragraph's mention of unaffected renal function could suggest that the patient has AKI.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just potential disease entities and without more information, it's difficult to accurately identify the disease mentioned in the paragraph."},

Renal function: This is a chemical entity as it refers to the function of the kidneys, which are organs that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n2.
