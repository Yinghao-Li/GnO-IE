Infants: The paragraph mentions \"infants\" as a group of people who received a specific medication dose. Infants are a distinct group of people who are under one year old, and they may have unique health needs and requirements compared to other age groups.\n2. Schoolchildren: The paragraph also mentions \"schoolchildren\" as a group of people who received the same medication dose. Schoolchildren are children who are attending school and are typically between the ages of 5 and 18. They may have different health needs and requirements compared to infants or other age groups.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities identified in the paragraph are \"infants\" and \"schoolchildren\"."},
