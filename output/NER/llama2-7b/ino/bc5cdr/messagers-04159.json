Pathology: This refers to the study of the nature of diseases through the examination of tissue samples.\n2. specimen: This refers to a sample of tissue or other material that has been collected for examination.\n3. contained: This verb means that the invasive carcinoma was present within the pathology specimen.\n4. clinically occult: This adjective means that the invasive carcinoma was not visible or detectable through clinical examination or diagnostic tests.\n5. invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis: This is the disease entity being described. It is a type of cancer that originates in the renal pelvis, which is the part of the kidney where urine collects before being filtered through the nephrons.\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis.\""},
