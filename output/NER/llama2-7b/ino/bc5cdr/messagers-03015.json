Thrombocytopenia: This refers to a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, which can increase the risk of bleeding.\n2. Thrombosis: This refers to the formation of a blood clot within a blood vessel, which can block the flow of blood and cause damage to tissues.\n3. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): This is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of heparin therapy, which can cause a severe decrease in platelet count and increase the risk of bleeding.\n4.
