Dopaminergic: This is a disease entity, as it refers to a type of neurotransmitter that is involved in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, addiction, and schizophrenia.\n2. Associative learning: This is not a disease entity, but rather a cognitive process that refers to the ability to connect new information or experiences to existing knowledge or memories.\n3. Parkinson's disease: This is a disease entity, as it is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination, and is characterized by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"Dopaminergic\" and \"Parkinson's disease\"."},
