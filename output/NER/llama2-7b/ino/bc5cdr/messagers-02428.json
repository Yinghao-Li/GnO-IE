    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the term \"Chemical\" does not appear explicitly. However, there are some entities that can be identified as chemicals:\n\n1. Extra-medullary: This term refers to something that is outside the medulla, which is a part of the brain. In this context, \"extra-medullary\" can be considered a chemical entity, as it is a term used to describe a location or structure outside the medulla.\n2. Relapses: Relapses refer to the recurrence of a disease or condition after a period of remission. In the context of cancer, relapses can occur when cancer cells that have been treated with chemotherapy or other treatments become resistant to the treatment and begin to grow again. Therefore, \"relapses\" can be considered a chemical entity, as it is a term used to describe the recurrence of a disease or condition that is caused by the growth and proliferation of cancer cells.\n\nSo, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Extra-medullary\n2. Relapses"},
