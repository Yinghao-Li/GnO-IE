To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Clinically significant anemia\" refers to a condition where there is a decrease in the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin levels in the blood, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.\n2. \"Hepatitis\" refers to inflammation of the liver, which can cause symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), fatigue, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Clinically significant anemia\n* Hepatitis\n\nI hope this helps!
