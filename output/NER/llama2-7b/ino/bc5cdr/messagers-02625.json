Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n\nEEGs, symptom, onset, improvement, clinical\n\n2. Check if any of the nouns are likely to be disease entities:\n\nYes, \"symptom\" and \"disease\" are likely to be disease entities.\n\n3. Check the context of the paragraph to determine if the disease entities are mentioned:\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"Repeat EEGs within 24 h of symptom onset showed marked improvement that was correlated with clinical improvement.\" This suggests that the disease entity being referred to is likely \"seizure\" or \"epilepsy\", as the paragraph mentions \"symptom onset\" and \"clinical improvement\".\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Seizure\n* Epilepsy"},
