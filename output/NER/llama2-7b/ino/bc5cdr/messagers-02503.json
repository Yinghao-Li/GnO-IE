Identify the medical conditions or diseases mentioned in the paragraph:\n\nIn the paragraph, the following disease entities are mentioned:\n\n* Delirium\n* Thiopentone\n* Propofol\n\n2. Determine whether each disease entity is a \"disease\" or a \"symptom\":\n\n* Delirium: A disease entity, as it is a clinical syndrome characterized by a disturbance in consciousness and cognition.\n* Thiopentone: A drug entity, as it is a medication used for sedation and anesthesia.\n* Propofol: A drug entity, as it is a medication used for sedation and anesthesia.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Delirium\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph (thiopentone and propofol) are not disease entities, but rather drug entities."},
