Acute myocardial dysfunction\n\nExplanation: The paragraph mentions \"acute myocardial dysfunction\" as a condition that pediatric patients may be suffering from. This refers to a disorder affecting the heart muscle, which can lead to abnormal heart function and potentially life-threatening consequences.\n\n2. Myocardial dysfunction\n\nExplanation: As a broader term, \"myocardial dysfunction\" refers to any disorder that affects the heart muscle, including acute myocardial dysfunction.\n\nI hope this helps!
