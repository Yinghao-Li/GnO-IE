It refers to abnormal movements of the body, often characterized by involuntary and repetitive movements of the limbs, face, or trunk.\n2. \"Pallidotomies\" is a disease entity. It refers to a surgical procedure that involves the destruction of a small area of the brain called the pallidum, which is involved in the control of movement and coordination.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Dyskinesias\n2. Pallidotomies"},

Radiofrequency: This is a type of electromagnetic radiation with a frequency range of about 3 kHz to 300 GHz.
