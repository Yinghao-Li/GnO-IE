Lithium - pilocarpine model: This is a disease or condition that is being studied in the paragraph. It is a model used to investigate the mechanisms of seizures.\n2. Pilocarpine: This is a drug or substance that is used to induce seizures in the lithium - pilocarpine model.\n3. Seizures: This is the disease entity being studied in the paragraph. It is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, leading to symptoms such as convulsions, loss of consciousness, and muscle stiffness.\n4. Anticonvulsant action: This is a therapeutic effect that is being studied in the paragraph. It refers to the ability of a drug or treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency or severity of seizures.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Seizures\n2. Pilocarpine\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

MK-801: This is a chemical compound that is used as a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. It is used as a research tool to study the role of glutamate receptors in various physiological processes, including seizures.\n2. Lithium: Lithium is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, but it also has been shown to have anticonvulsant effects.\n3. Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is a chemical compound that is used as a cholinergic agonist and is used to study the role of acetylcholine in various physiological processes, including seizures.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* MK-801 (NMDA receptor antagonist)\n* Lithium (element)\n* Pilocarpine (cholinergic agonist)"},
