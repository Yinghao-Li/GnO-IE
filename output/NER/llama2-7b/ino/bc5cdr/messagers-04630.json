Prolactin: This is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates milk production in lactating women. In the context of the paragraph, \"hyperprolactinemia\" means an abnormal increase in prolactin levels.\n2. DA: DA stands for dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter involved in various physiological processes, including mood regulation, motivation, and reward processing. In the context of the paragraph, \"DA concentrations\" refers to the levels of dopamine in the brain.\n\nSo, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are prolactin and dopamine (DA)."},
