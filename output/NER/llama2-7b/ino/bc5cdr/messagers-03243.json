To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"It is associated with\" - This phrase indicates a relationship between two entities, where the first entity (in this case, \"it\") is associated with the second entity (in this case, \"significant side effects\").\n2. \"significant side effects\" - This entity is a collection of symptoms or complications that occur as a result of a particular condition or disease. In this case, the significant side effects are related to the disease being discussed.\n3. \"cataract\" - This is a specific disease entity, which is a clouding of the lens in the eye that can impair vision.\n4. \"ocular hypertension\" - This is another specific disease entity, which refers to increased pressure in the eye that can lead to vision problems.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cataract\n* Ocular hypertension\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

Cataract: A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that can cause vision loss. It is a chemical entity as it is a complex mixture of proteins and other substances that accumulate in the lens of the eye.\n2. Ocular hypertension: Ocular hypertension refers to increased pressure inside the eye. It is a chemical entity as it is a measure of the pressure exerted on the eye's structures, which can be caused by various chemical factors.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
