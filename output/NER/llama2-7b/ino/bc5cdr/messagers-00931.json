Nephritis: This is a general term for inflammation of the kidneys, which can be caused by various factors including infection, autoimmune disorders, or toxins.\n3. Renal cortex: This refers to the outer layer of the kidney, which is responsible for filtering waste products from the blood.\n4. Structural and functional renal changes: These terms refer to any changes that occur in the structure or function of the kidneys as a result of the treatment with gentamicin or gentamicin + PDTC.\n5. Macrophages: These are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune system, and are involved in the inflammatory response in the kidneys.\n6. NF-κB: This is a protein that is involved in the regulation of genes involved in inflammation and immune responses.\n7. MAP kinases: These are enzymes that are involved in signaling pathways that regulate various cellular processes, including inflammation and immune responses.\n\nI hope this helps!
