Vasodilation: This is a medical condition where the muscles in the blood vessels relax, allowing the vessels to widen and increase blood flow.\n2. Flow dependency: This is a condition where the flow of blood through a particular area of the body is affected, either due to blockage or narrowing of the blood vessels.\n3. Cromakalim: This is a medication that is used to treat various cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension and heart failure.\n4. Pinacidil: This is another medication that is used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions.\n5. CxAD: This is an abbreviation for \"capillary conductance\", which refers to the ability of the blood vessels to allow blood to flow through them.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Vasodilation\n* Flow dependency\n* Hypertension (mentioned as a condition that cromakalim and pinacidil are used to treat)\n\nNote that while cromakalim and pinacidil are medications, they are not disease entities in this context, but rather drugs that are used to treat diseases."},
