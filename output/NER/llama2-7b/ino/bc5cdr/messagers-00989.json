Hypertension (HTN): The paragraph compares the specific gravity of three groups: 15/HTN, 90/HTN, and control. The term \"HTN\" suggests that these groups have different levels of hypertension.\n2. High blood pressure (HBP): The paragraph mentions \"15/HTN\" and \"90/HTN\" groups, which implies that these groups have different levels of high blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are hypertension and high blood pressure."},
