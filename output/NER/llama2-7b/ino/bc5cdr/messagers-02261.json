Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is the concentration of daptomycin in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a patient.\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Daptomycin\n * Serum\n * CSF\n * Trough concentrations\n3. Determine whether each entity is a disease or a non-disease entity:\n * Daptomycin: A drug used to treat bacterial infections, not a disease entity.\n * Serum: A fluid component of blood, not a disease entity.\n * CSF: Cerebrospinal fluid, a fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, not a disease entity.\n * Trough concentrations: A measure of the concentration of a drug or other substance in the blood or other fluid, not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"bacterial infections,\" which is the condition that daptomycin is used to treat."},
