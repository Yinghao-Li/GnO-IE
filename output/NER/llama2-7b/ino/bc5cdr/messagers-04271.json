Cardiac disease\n2. Arrhythmia"},

Cardiac pacing: This is a medical device that is used to regulate the heart's rhythm. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical device.\n2. Rhythm: This is a term used to describe the normal pattern of the heart's contractions. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a physiological phenomenon.\n3. Output: This is a term used to describe the amount of blood that is pumped by the heart with each beat. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a physiological parameter.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Captured rhythm: This is a term used to describe a specific type of cardiac arrhythmia, which is a disruption in the normal rhythm of the heart. In this context, \"captured\" refers to the use of cardiac pacing to restore the normal rhythm of the heart."},
