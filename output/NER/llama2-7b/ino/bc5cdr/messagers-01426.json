Lead poisoning: The paragraph mentions that succimer chelation improves cognitive function in lead-exposed rats, but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure. This suggests that lead poisoning is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Attention: The paragraph mentions that succimer chelation improves attention in lead-exposed rats.\n3. Arousal regulation: The paragraph also mentions that succimer chelation improves arousal regulation in lead-exposed rats.\n4. Cognitive impairment: The paragraph mentions that succimer chelation produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure.
