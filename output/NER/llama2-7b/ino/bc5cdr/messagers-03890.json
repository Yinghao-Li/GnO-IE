Fibrinolytic disorders: This refers to a group of conditions that affect the body's ability to break down blood clots.\n2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): This is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body, leading to damage to multiple organs and tissues.\n3. Consumption coagulopathies: This term refers to a group of conditions in which the body's ability to form blood clots is impaired, leading to a decrease in the number of platelets and a tendency to bleed.\n4. Thrombosis: This is the formation of a blood clot within a blood vessel.\n5. Infarction: This is the damage or death of tissue due to a lack of blood supply.\n6. Kidney infarction: This is a type of infarction that occurs in the kidneys, leading to damage or death of kidney tissue.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
