Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * TNF (Disease)\n * PAF (Disease)\n * cases (Disease)\n * controls (Disease)\n2. Identify the verbs in the paragraph:\n * found (action)\n3. Identify the subjects of the verbs:\n * TNF (Disease)\n * PAF (Disease)\n * cases (Disease)\n * controls (Disease)\n4. Determine whether each noun phrase is a disease entity or not:\n * TNF (Disease)\n * PAF (Disease)\n * cases (Disease)\n * controls (Disease)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* TNF (Disease)\n* PAF (Disease)\n* cases (Disease)\n* controls (Disease)"},
