Fibrosis: Fibrosis is a chemical process involving the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as collagen, in the renal cortex.\n2. Renal function: Renal function refers to the chemical processes that occur in the kidneys to filter waste products and regulate electrolyte levels in the body.\n3. Extracellular matrix (ECM): The ECM is a complex network of chemical components, including collagen, laminin, and other proteins, that provide structural support to cells and tissues.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
