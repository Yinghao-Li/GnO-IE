Warfarin-induced embryopathy: This is a condition that occurs when a developing fetus is exposed to warfarin, a blood thinner, during pregnancy. It can cause a range of birth defects, including nasal hypoplasia and stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata).\n2. Nasal hypoplasia: This is a condition where the nasal passages are underdeveloped or abnormally small.\n3. Stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata): This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the long bones in the body, causing them to be irregularly shaped and have a \"stippled\" appearance.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are warfarin-induced embryopathy and chondrodysplasia punctata."},
