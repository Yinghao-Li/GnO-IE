Dose - This is a chemical entity, as it refers to a specific amount or quantity of a substance.\n2. Hyper - This is a prefix that means \"beyond\" or \"excessive,\" and it is used to describe a condition or state that is characterized by an abnormal increase in a particular chemical entity, such as blood pressure or serum concentration.\n3. Hypotension - This is a chemical entity that refers to a condition characterized by a decrease in blood pressure, which can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, blood loss, or medication.\n4. Retained placenta - This is a chemical entity that refers to the placenta, which is a organ that develops in the uterus during pregnancy and provides oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. In this context, \"retained\" means that the placenta has not been expelled from the uterus after childbirth, which can be a serious complication.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
