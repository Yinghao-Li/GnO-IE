Elevated IOP (intraocular pressure) - This refers to a condition where the pressure inside the eye is higher than normal, which can lead to vision problems and other complications.\n2. ER stress - This stands for endoplasmic reticulum stress, which refers to a condition where the cells in the body are under stress due to an imbalance in the production and folding of proteins. This can lead to a range of diseases, including inflammation and organ damage.\n\nSo, in summary, the two \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are elevated IOP and ER stress."},
