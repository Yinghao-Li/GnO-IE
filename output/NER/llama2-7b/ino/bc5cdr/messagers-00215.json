Norleucine: Norleucine is a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) that has been shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.\n2. Norvaline: Norvaline is a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) that has been shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.\n3. Glutamate: Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that is involved in various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.\n4. Epsilon-aminocaproate: Epsilon-aminocaproate is a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) that has been shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.\n5. Methionine: Methionine is an amino acid that is involved in various metabolic processes in the body, including the synthesis of proteins and neurotransmitters. However, excessive levels of methionine can accumulate in the brain and contribute to the development of certain neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nTherefore, the entities \"Norleucine\", \"Norvaline\", \"Glutamate\", \"epsilon-aminocaproate\", and \"Methionine\" are identified as \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},
