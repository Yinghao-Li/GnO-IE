The paragraph mentions that the patients are diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer (stage T1cN0M0, Gleason score 2-5).\n2. Low-risk prostate cancer: This is a specific type of prostate cancer that is considered to be less aggressive and less likely to spread quickly.\n3. Gleason score: This is a measure of the severity of the prostate cancer, with higher scores indicating more aggressive cancer. The paragraph mentions that the patients have a Gleason score of 2-5.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
