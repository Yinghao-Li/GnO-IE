Drugs: The paragraph mentions adverse reactions to drugs as a cause of urticaria and angio-oedema, which are both chemical reactions.\n2. Urticaria: Urticaria is a type of skin reaction characterized by red, itchy, and swollen patches. It is caused by the release of chemical mediators from mast cells, which are a type of immune system cell.\n3. Angio-oedema: Angio-oedema is a type of swelling that occurs due to the release of chemical mediators from blood vessels. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including adverse reactions to drugs.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Drugs\n2. Urticaria\n3. Angio-oedema"},
