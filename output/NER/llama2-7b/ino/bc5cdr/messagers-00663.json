Phagocytosis: This is the process of engulfing and digesting foreign particles or cellular debris by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages.

Fat necrosis: This is the term used to describe the death of fat cells due to various reasons, such as inflammation, infection, or injury. In the paragraph, fat necrosis is suggested to have occurred prior to the phagocytosis of fat cells by lipophages.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.

Lipophages: These are the entities that are being phagocytosed (engulfed and digested) by the cells in the periorbital fat. Lipophages are specialized cells that are capable of breaking down and recycling lipids (fats).\n2. Fat cells: These are the cells that are being phagocytosed by the lipophages. Fat cells, also known as adipocytes, are cells that store energy in the form of fat.\n3. Necrosis: This is a type of cell death that occurs due to injury or disease. In the context of the paragraph, fat necrosis refers to the death of fat cells in the periorbital fat.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Lipophages\n* Fat cells\n* Necrosis"},
