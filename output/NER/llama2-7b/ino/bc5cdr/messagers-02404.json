Pubertal BPA exposure: This refers to exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA) during puberty, which is a critical period of brain development.\n2. Anxiety: This refers to a mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry, nervousness, and fear that are persistent and excessive.\n3. Decreased AChE activity: This refers to a decrease in the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the hippocampus, which is a part of the brain involved in memory and emotion regulation."},
