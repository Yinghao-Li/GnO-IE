Brain: The paragraph mentions patients with ADSD, which suggests that the disorder is related to the brain or nervous system.\n3. Neurotransmitters: Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons in the brain. Imbalances in neurotransmitters have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including ADHD.\n4. Hormones: Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate various bodily functions, including mood, energy, and metabolism.
