To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Increased serum soluble Fas\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific measure of a protein (soluble Fas) in the blood that is elevated in certain medical conditions, including acute liver failure.\n2. \"patients with acute liver failure\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific type of liver dysfunction that is characterized by sudden and severe damage to the liver.\n3. \"due to paracetamol overdose\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific cause of acute liver failure, which is an overdose of the drug paracetamol (acetaminophen).\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Increased serum soluble Fas\n* Acute liver failure\n* Paracetamol overdose"},
