To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis\" - This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is a type of inflammatory disease that affects the bladder.\n2. \"Cystitis\" - This is a broader term that refers to any inflammation of the bladder. It is a more general term than \"cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis\".\n3. \"Inflammation\" - This is a broader term that refers to any type of swelling or redness of a body part or organ. It is a more general term than \"cystitis\".\n4. \"Disease\" - This is the most general term of all, and it refers to any abnormal condition that affects the body or mind.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis\n* Cystitis\n* Inflammation\n* Disease\n\nI hope this helps!
