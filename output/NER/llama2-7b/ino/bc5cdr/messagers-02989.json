To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Severe hypotension\" refers to a condition where the blood pressure is abnormally low. In this case, the mean arterial pressure is < 60 mm Hg, which is considered severe.\n2. \"Bradycardia\" refers to a condition where the heart rate is abnormally slow. In this case, the heart rate is < 50 beats per minute, which is also considered abnormal.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Severe hypotension\n2. Bradycardia"},

Examples of sedatives include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and non-benzodiazepines.\n2. Hypotension: This is a medical term that refers to low blood pressure. In this context, it is used to describe a severe decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) to < 60 mm Hg.\n3. Bradycardia: This is a medical term that refers to a slow heart rate. In this context, it is used to describe a heart rate of < 50 beats per minute (bpm).\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Sedative (a class of drugs)\n* Hypotension (a medical condition)\n* Bradycardia (a medical condition)"},
