Bradycardia - a condition characterized by a slow heart rate (usually below 60 beats per minute).\n2. Hypothermia - a condition where the body's temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius).\n3. Respiratory failure - a condition where the lungs are unable to provide enough oxygen to the body's tissues.\n4. Atrial fibrillation - a type of irregular heartbeat where the heart's upper chambers (atria) beat too quickly and irregularly.\n\nSo, the three diseases mentioned in the paragraph are bradycardia, hypothermia, and respiratory failure."},
