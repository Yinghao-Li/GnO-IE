Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)\n6. Cytokines (specifically, IL-1β and TNF-α)\n\nLet me explain each of these entities:\n\n1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): A sudden and temporary loss of kidney function, which can be caused by various factors such as drug toxicity, infection, or injury.\n2. Renal function: Refers to the ability of the kidneys to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n3. Creatinine: A waste product that is produced by the muscles and excreted by the kidneys. Elevated levels of creatinine in the blood can indicate kidney dysfunction.\n4. Urea: A waste product that is produced by the breakdown of protein in the body. Elevated levels of urea in the blood can indicate kidney dysfunction.\n5. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): A type of kidney damage that occurs when the tubules of the kidney are damaged, leading to impaired kidney function.\n6. Cytokines: These are signaling molecules that are produced by immune cells and can affect the function of other cells in the body. In the context of the paragraph, IL-1β and TNF-α are specific cytokines that are mentioned.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
