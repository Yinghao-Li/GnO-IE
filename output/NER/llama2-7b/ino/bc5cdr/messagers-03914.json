It can be caused by various chemical substances, such as toxins, pollutants, or certain drugs.\n\nNote: The term \"growth retardation\" is a general term that encompasses a range of phenomena, including cell cycle arrest, cell death, and changes in cellular metabolism.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, \"growth retardation\" is the only chemical entity mentioned."},
