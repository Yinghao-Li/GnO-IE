Cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a type of kidney damage caused by the chemotherapy drug cisplatin.\n2. Necrotic process: This is a disease entity mentioned in the context of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, which refers to the death of kidney cells due to injury or damage.\n3. Inflammatory cytokines: This is a disease entity mentioned in the context of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, which refers to a group of proteins that are produced by the immune system in response to injury or infection, and can cause inflammation in the body.\n4. Declined renal function: This is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a decrease in the function of the kidneys, which can lead to a buildup of waste products in the body and other complications.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury\n* Necrotic process\n* Inflammatory cytokines\n* Declined renal function"},
