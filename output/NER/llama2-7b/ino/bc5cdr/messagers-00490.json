Necrosis: This is the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph as a condition that Troponin and CK-MB can be used to diagnose. Necrosis is the premature death of cells or tissues, which can occur due to various reasons such as injury, infection, or lack of blood supply.\n2. Myocardial infarction (MI): The paragraph mentions that the patients in question have chest pain and are suspected to have MI. Myocardial infarction is a disease entity that occurs when the blood supply to the heart muscle is interrupted, causing damage to the heart tissue.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Necrosis\n2. Myocardial infarction (MI)"},
