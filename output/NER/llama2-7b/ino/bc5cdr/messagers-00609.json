Arterial Paco2 (Pulmonary Arterial Carbon Dioxide Tension): This is a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can be elevated in conditions such as hypoventilation.\n3. VE (Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio): This is a measure of the balance between the amount of air being breathed in and out, and the amount of blood flowing through the lungs. An increase in VE can indicate a mismatch between these two variables, which can occur in conditions such as hypoventilation."},
