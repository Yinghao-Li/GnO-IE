SE (Status Epilepticus) - a type of seizure disorder characterized by continuous or recurrent seizures that last for more than 30 minutes.\n2. Hypertrophied astrocytes - a condition where astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the brain, become abnormally enlarged.\n3. CA1 - a region of the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory and emotion regulation.\n4. Dentate gyrus - a region of the hippocampus involved in the formation and consolidation of new memories.\n\nSo, the paragraph is suggesting that rats that experienced Status Epilepticus (SE) exhibited increased labeling of CCR2 in populations of hypertrophied astrocytes, particularly in the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the brain."},
