Regression: Regression is a statistical technique used to identify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this context, multivariate regression analysis is used to identify independent predictors of postoperative seizures.\n2. Seizures: Seizures are a type of chemical reaction that occurs in the brain, characterized by abnormal electrical activity.\n3. Postoperative: Postoperative refers to the period of time after a surgical procedure, during which the body is recovering from the surgery.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
