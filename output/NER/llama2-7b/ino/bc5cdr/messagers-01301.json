Behavioral seizures: This is a type of seizure disorder that affects an individual's behavior, leading to abnormal movements or behaviors.\n2. Ectopic granule cells in the hilus: This refers to an abnormal growth or development of granule cells in the hilus, which is a part of the brain. The presence of ectopic granule cells in the hilus can lead to an increased frequency of behavioral seizures.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Behavioral seizures\n2. Ectopic granule cells in the hilus"},

Ectopic granule cells: These are cells that are present in an abnormal location or outside of their normal functioning area in the brain. They are not normally found in the hilus, but their presence in this area may be related to the frequency of behavioral seizures.\n2. Neurotransmitters: These are chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons in the brain. They play a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including the transmission of signals between neurons.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"ectopic granule cells\" and \"neurotransmitters\"."},
