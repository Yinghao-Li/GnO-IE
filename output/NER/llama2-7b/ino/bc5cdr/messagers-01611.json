Pain: The paragraph mentions that the bupivacaine/placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 hours after the treatment, indicating that pain is a disease or a symptom of a disease.\n2. PGE2 levels: The paragraph also mentions that the PGE2 levels during the first 4 hours after treatment were significantly higher in the bupivacaine/placebo group, which suggests that there is an imbalance or abnormality in the levels of PGE2, which is a prostaglandin that is involved in pain regulation.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Pain\n2. Imbalance or abnormality in PGE2 levels"},
