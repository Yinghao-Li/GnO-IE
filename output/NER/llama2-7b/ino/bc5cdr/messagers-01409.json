The placebo group is used as a control to compare the outcomes of the treatment group.\n2. Double-Blind: This is a type of study design where neither the participants nor the researchers know which group the participant is assigned to (treatment or placebo). This is done to minimize bias and ensure that the results are due to the actual treatment and not to the researchers' expectations or biases.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, the \"Disease\" entities are \"Placebo Controlled\" and \"Double-Blind\"."},

Placebo: A placebo is a substance that has no active therapeutic effect but is administered to a patient to mimic the real treatment. It is used as a control in clinical trials to compare the effects of the real treatment with those of the placebo.\n2. Double-blind: Double-blind refers to a study design in which neither the participants nor the researchers know which group the participants are assigned to (placebo or active treatment). This design is used to minimize bias and ensure that the results are due to the actual treatment and not to the researchers' expectations or biases.\n3. Parallel-group: Parallel-group refers to a study design in which two or more groups of participants are compared directly, without any intervening steps. In this case, the groups are compared to determine the effectiveness of the active treatment versus the placebo.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Placebo\n2.
