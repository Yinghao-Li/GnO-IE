Challenge: This entity represents the stimulus or event that triggers a reaction or response in the body. In this case, the challenge refers to the exposure of the patients to something that causes a reaction.\n2. Reaction: This entity represents the response or outcome of the body's reaction to the challenge. In this case, the reaction refers to the symptoms or effects that the patients experience after being challenged.\n3. Delayed reaction: This entity represents a reaction that occurs after a delay, beyond the initial 24 hours after the challenge. In this case, the delayed reaction refers to the possibility that the patients may experience additional symptoms or effects after the initial 24 hours have passed.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
