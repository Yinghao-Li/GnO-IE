Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI): This is a class of antiviral drugs that work by inhibiting the reverse transcription of the viral DNA by the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme.\n4. Chronic hepatitis B: This is a long-term infection of the liver by the hepatitis B virus, which can lead to chronic liver disease and liver cancer.\n5.
