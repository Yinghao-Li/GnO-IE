Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy: This is the specific disease or condition being studied in the paragraph, which is a type of heart disease caused by the drug doxorubicin.\n2. Cardiomyopathy: This is a broader term that refers to any disease or disorder of the heart muscle.\n3. Toxicity: This term refers to the harmful effects of a substance, in this case, doxorubicin, on the body.\n4. Serological events: This term refers to changes or abnormalities in the body's serum or blood, which can be an indicator of disease.\n5. Pathological events: This term refers to changes or abnormalities in the body's tissues or organs, which can be an indicator of disease.\n6. Functional events: This term refers to changes or abnormalities in the body's functions or processes, which can be an indicator of disease.\n\nI hope this helps!
