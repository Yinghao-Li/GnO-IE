    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Glomeruli\" is a disease entity. It refers to the glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n2. \"Membrane spikes\" is a disease entity. It refers to the abnormal protrusions or spikes on the membranes of the glomeruli.\n3. \"Prominent swelling of podocytes\" is a disease entity. Podocytes are specialized cells in the glomeruli that play a critical role in maintaining the filtration barrier. When they become swollen, it can indicate a disease process.\n4. \"Subepithelial deposits\" is a disease entity. It refers to abnormal deposits that accumulate beneath the epithelial layer of the glomeruli.\n5. \"Hump-like\" is a descriptive term that is not a disease entity in itself, but it can be used to describe the appearance of the subepithelial deposits.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Glomeruli\n* Membrane spikes\n* Podocyte swelling\n* Subepithelial deposits"},

The other entities mentioned (membrane spikes and subepithelial deposits) are not disease entities in themselves, but rather descriptive terms that help to describe the appearance of the glomeruli."},
