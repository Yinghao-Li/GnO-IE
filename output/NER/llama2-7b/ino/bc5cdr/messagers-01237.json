Dopamine: This is the neurotransmitter that is being released and transmitted by the dopaminergic neurons.\n3. Neurotransmission: This refers to the process of transmitting signals between neurons, which involves the release and reception of neurotransmitters.\n4. Phasic dopaminergic neurotransmission: This refers to the rapid, temporary increase in dopamine release in response to a specific stimulus.\n5.
