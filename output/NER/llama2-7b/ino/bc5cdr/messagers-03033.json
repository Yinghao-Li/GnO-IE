Hyper locomotion: This refers to abnormal or excessive movement, which could be a symptom of certain neurological or psychiatric disorders.\n2. Climbing: This refers to the ability to climb or ascend, which could be affected in certain neurological or muscular disorders.\n3. Catalepsy: This refers to a condition characterized by a sudden and involuntary immobility or rigidity of the muscles, often seen in certain neurological disorders such as catatonia.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Chemical\":\n\n1. Kruskal - Wallis test: This is a statistical test that is used to analyze the distribution of data in a non-parametric manner. It is a chemical test in the sense that it is a mathematical procedure that is used to analyze data, but it is not a chemical substance.\n2. ANOVA: ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance, which is a statistical technique used to compare the means of three or more groups. It is a chemical test in the sense that it is a mathematical procedure that is used to analyze data, but it is not a chemical substance.\n3. Hyper locomotion: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a biological phenomenon. Locomotion refers to the ability of an organism to move around, and hyper locomotion refers to an abnormal increase in this ability.\n4. Climbing: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a biological phenomenon. Climbing refers to the ability of an organism to ascend a vertical surface.\n5. Catalepsy: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a biological phenomenon. Catalepsy refers to a state of immobility or rigidity, often seen in response to certain drugs or neurological disorders.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are Kruskal - Wallis test and ANOVA."},
