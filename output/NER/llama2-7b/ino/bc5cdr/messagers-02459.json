Cancer: The phrase \"600 mg / m2\" suggests that the drug dosage is being measured in terms of the surface area of a patient's body, which is a common way to administer cancer drugs.\n2. Dosage: The paragraph mentions two different drug doses: 16 mg/kg and 600 mg/m2. This suggests that the drug is being administered in two different doses, which could be related to different diseases or conditions.\n3. Cancer treatment: The use of high doses of a drug (600 mg/m2) suggests that the drug may be used to treat a serious or aggressive form of cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cancer\n* Dosage\n* Cancer treatment"},
