Sinus rhythm: This refers to the normal, regular heartbeat pattern of the sinus node, which is the natural pacemaker of the heart.\n2. Atrial block: This refers to a condition where the electrical signals from the atria (the upper chambers of the heart) are blocked or delayed, disrupting the normal conduction of electrical impulses through the heart. In this case, the paragraph mentions \"intermittent 2/1 S-A block\", which indicates that there are occasional blocks of electrical impulses in the atria, resulting in a irregular heartbeat pattern.\n\nSo, the two \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Sinus rhythm\n2. Atrial block"},
