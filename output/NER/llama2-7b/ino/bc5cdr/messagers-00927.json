Dyskinetic refers to a type of movement disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary movements, particularly in the face, arms, and legs.\n2. Parkinson's disease: The paragraph mentions that the patients in the study had dyskinetic movements, which suggests that they may have Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, including the ability to walk, talk, and perform other daily activities.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Dyskinetic\n2. Parkinson's disease"},
