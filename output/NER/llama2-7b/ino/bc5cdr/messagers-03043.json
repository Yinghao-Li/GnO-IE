FPD (Fundamental Physiologic Disorder) - This refers to any abnormality in the normal functioning of the body's physiological processes.\n2. MEA (Multielectrode Array) - This is a device used to measure the electrical activity of cells or tissues.\n3. hiPS (Human Induced Pluripotent Stem) - This refers to a type of stem cell that is derived from adult cells, such as skin or blood cells, and is reprogrammed to have the ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body.\n4. CMs (Cardiac Muscles) - This refers to the muscles that make up the heart.\n5. QT prolongation - This is a type of cardiac arrhythmia, or abnormal heart rhythm, characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG).\n6. Multichannel blockers - These are drugs that block the activity of multiple channels in the heart, leading to QT prolongation."},
