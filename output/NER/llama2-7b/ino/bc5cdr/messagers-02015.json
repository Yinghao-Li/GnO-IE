However, based on the context, we can identify the following potential disease entities:\n\n1. Proliferative response: This refers to the abnormal growth or proliferation of cells in the body, which can be a symptom of various diseases such as cancer, inflammation, or infection.\n2. WT animals: WT stands for \"wild-type,\" which refers to an organism that has a normal or natural genetic makeup, as opposed to an organism that has been genetically modified or altered in some way. In this context, \"WT animals\" may be used to refer to animals that have not been genetically modified or altered in any way, and therefore have a normal or natural proliferative response.\n\nTherefore, the potential disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Proliferative response (abnormal growth or proliferation of cells)\n2. WT animals (normal or natural genetic makeup)"},
