Identify the keywords:\n * Capsaicin\n * injection\n * secondary hyperalgesia\n * allodynia\n2. Determine the context:\n * The paragraph is discussing the reproducibility of a study using capsaicin injection to induce secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia.\n3. Identify the disease entities:\n * Based on the context and keywords, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n  + Secondary hyperalgesia\n  + Allodynia\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Secondary hyperalgesia refers to a condition in which there is an increased sensitivity to pain in response to a stimulus that did not previously cause pain.\n* Allodynia refers to a condition in which non-painful stimuli (such as light touch or temperature changes) are perceived as painful.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia."},
