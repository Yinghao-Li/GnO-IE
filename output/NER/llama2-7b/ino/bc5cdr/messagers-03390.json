To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Renal\": This is a disease entity, as it refers to the kidneys.\n2. \"angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2R)\": This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific type of receptor in the body.\n3. \"AT2R gene expression\": This is a disease entity, as it refers to the expression of the AT2R gene, which can be affected in various diseases.\n4. \"adult offspring\": This is a disease entity, as it refers to the offspring of an individual, which can be affected by genetic or environmental factors.\n5. \"PCE\": This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific treatment or intervention that can affect the expression of the AT2R gene.\n6. \"renal angiotensin II receptor type 1a (AT1aR)/AT2R expression ratio\": This is a disease entity, as it refers to the balance between two specific types of receptors in the kidneys, which can be affected in various diseases.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Renal\n* Angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2R)\n* AT2R gene expression\n* Adult offspring\n* PCE\n* Renal angiotensin II receptor type 1a (AT1aR)/AT2R expression ratio"},
