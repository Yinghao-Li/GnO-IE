Blood: This is a fluid that circulates throughout the body and contains various chemical components, including proteins, sugars, hormones, and gases.\n2. Pressure: This is a measure of the force exerted on a surface or volume of fluid, often measured in units of millimeters of mercury (mmHg).\n3. Systolic blood pressure: This is the highest pressure measured in the blood vessels during a heartbeat, usually measured in mmHg.\n4. P: This is an abbreviation for \"proportionality,\" which is a mathematical term used to describe the relationship between two quantities.
