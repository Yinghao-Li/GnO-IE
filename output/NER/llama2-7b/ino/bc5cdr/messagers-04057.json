The paragraph suggests that the myocardial O2 consumption and O2 availability are directly dependent on the coronary perfusion, which means that the delivery of oxygen to the heart muscle is affected by the blood flow to the coronary arteries.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myocardial O2 consumption\n2. Myocardial O2 availability\n3. Coronary perfusion\n\nThese entities are related to the heart and its function, and the paragraph suggests that they are affected by the blood flow to the coronary arteries."},
