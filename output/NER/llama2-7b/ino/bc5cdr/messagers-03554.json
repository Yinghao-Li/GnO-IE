Hyperammonemia\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each term:\n\n1. Central nervous system (CNS): The CNS refers to the brain and spinal cord. It is the primary control center for the body's functions, including movement, sensation, perception, and emotion.\n2. Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. These seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n3. Hyperammonemia: Hyperammonemia is a condition in which there is an excess of ammonia in the blood. Ammonia is a byproduct of protein metabolism that is normally removed from the body through the liver. If the liver is not functioning properly, ammonia levels can build up in the blood, leading to a range of symptoms including confusion, lethargy, and seizures.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
