Hypercapnia: This is a medical condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can lead to respiratory problems and other complications.\n2. Respiratory response: This refers to the body's response to changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the blood, including the mechanisms that regulate breathing and gas exchange in the lungs.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
