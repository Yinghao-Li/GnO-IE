Dilatation: This refers to the widening or expansion of something, in this case, the tubular lumens.\n2. Vacuolization: This refers to the accumulation of fluid-filled vacuoles or vesicles in cells. In this context, it means that the epithelial cells have taken up more fluid than usual.\n3. Atrophy: This refers to the shrinking or wasting away of cells or tissues. In this context, it means that the epithelial cells have shrunk or wasted away.\n4. Desquamation: This refers to the shedding or sloughing off of skin or epithelial cells. In this context, it means that the epithelial cells are being shed more than usual.\n5. Necrosis: This refers to the death of cells or tissues due to injury or disease. In this context, it means that the epithelial cells are dying due to the effects of VCM.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Dilatation (a physical change)\n* Vacuolization (a physical change)\n* Atrophy (a physical change)\n* Desquamation (a physical change)\n* Necrosis (a chemical change)"},
