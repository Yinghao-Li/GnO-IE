Lipid peroxidation: The oxidation of lipids (fats) in the body, which can lead to the formation of harmful compounds called reactive aldehydes.\n4.

Lipid peroxidation\n4. Irreversible injury"},

In the context of the paragraph, \"lipid peroxidation\" refers to the oxidation of lipids, which can lead to the formation of reactive aldehydes and lipid peroxides.\n2. Peroxidation: This is a chemical reaction in which a molecule gains an oxygen atom, resulting in the formation of a peroxide. In the context of the paragraph, \"lipid peroxidation\" specifically refers to the oxidation of lipids, which can lead to the formation of reactive aldehydes and lipid peroxides.\n3. Oxidant: This is a chemical substance that can cause oxidation reactions. In the context of the paragraph, the oxidant is likely a reactive species that can react with lipids and cause lipid peroxidation.\n4. Irreversible injury: This refers to a type of injury that cannot be reversed or repaired. In the context of the paragraph, the lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to result in irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membranes.\n\nI hope this helps!
