Quinine: This is a chemical compound that is administered parenterally (through injection or infusion) to treat malaria.\n2. Electrolytes: The paragraph mentions hypokalemia, which is a disorder characterized by low levels of potassium ions in the blood. Potassium is an electrolyte that plays a crucial role in maintaining the proper functioning of the heart and other bodily functions.\n3. Vomiting: The paragraph mentions that vomiting can lead to electrolyte disorders, including hypokalemia, due to the loss of electrolytes in the vomit.\n4. Diarrhea: Similarly, diarrhea can also lead to electrolyte disorders, including hypokalemia, due to the loss of electrolytes in the stool.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
