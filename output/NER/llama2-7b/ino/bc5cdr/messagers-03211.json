Cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced nephropathy: This is the disease that the protocols are trying to prevent. It is a type of kidney damage that occurs as a side effect of taking cyclosporin A after a transplant.\n2. Nephropathy: This is a general term for any type of kidney damage or disease. In this context, it refers to the specific type of kidney damage caused by cyclosporin A.\n3. Sirolimus (SRL)-induced nephropathy: This is another type of kidney damage that is mentioned in the paragraph. It is possible that this type of nephropathy may occur as a result of switching from cyclosporin A to sirolimus.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cyclosporin A-induced nephropathy\n2. Nephropathy\n3. Sirolimus-induced nephropathy"},
