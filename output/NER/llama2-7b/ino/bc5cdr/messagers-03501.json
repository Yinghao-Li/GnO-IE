Stress: Stress is a psychological and physiological response to a challenging situation, and it can have a significant impact on the body's stress response system. Chronic stress can lead to a range of health problems, including anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular disease.\n2. Adrenaline: Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that plays a crucial role in the body's \"fight or flight\" response to stress. Elevated levels of adrenaline can cause a range of physiological effects, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and energy levels.\n3. Pressor effect: The term \"pressor effect\" refers to the effect of a substance on blood pressure. In the context of the paragraph, \"pressor effect\" is used to describe the effect of elevated levels of adrenaline on blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Stress\n2. Adrenaline"},
