However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that could be related to diseases:\n\n1. Morphine: Morphine is a drug that is commonly used to treat pain. While it can provide relief from pain, it can also have negative effects on the body and can lead to addiction.\n2. OIH: OIH stands for Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia, which is a condition that can occur in individuals who are taking opioids, such as morphine, for an extended period. It is characterized by increased sensitivity to pain and can occur as a result of the body adapting to the constant presence of the drug.\n\nTherefore, the two entities that are related to diseases in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Morphine\n2. OIH (Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia)"},
