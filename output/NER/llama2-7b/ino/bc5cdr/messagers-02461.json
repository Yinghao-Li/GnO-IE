To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Ninety - six patients\" - This is the patient population being studied, and they are the ones who are potentially affected by the disease.\n2. \"developed seizures\" - This is the disease entity being studied. Seizures are a symptom of various neurological disorders, and in this context, they are likely caused by the busulfan treatment.\n3. \"during the 4 days of the busulfan course\" - This phrase indicates that the seizures occurred during the time the patients were receiving the busulfan treatment.\n4. \"or within 24 h after the last dosing\" - This phrase suggests that the seizures could occur either during the 4 days of busulfan treatment or within 24 hours after the last dose of the treatment.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"seizures\" or \"neurological disorder caused by busulfan treatment\"."},
