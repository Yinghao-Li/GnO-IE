Hyperkalemia: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to an abnormally high level of potassium in the blood.\n2. Spiranolactone: This is a medication mentioned in the paragraph as the cause of hyperkalemia. Spiranolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, which means it blocks the action of the hormone aldosterone and helps to reduce the amount of potassium in the body.\n3. Ramipril: This is another medication mentioned in the paragraph as a contributing factor to hyperkalemia. Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor, which stands for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. It is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure.\n\nSo, in summary, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are hyperkalemia, spiranolactone, and ramipril."},
