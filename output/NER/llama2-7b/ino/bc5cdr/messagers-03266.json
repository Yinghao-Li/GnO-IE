Disease: Lithium is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder, but it can also cause certain side effects, including electrolyte imbalances.\n2. Entity: Urinary sodium (Na+) - This refers to the amount of sodium present in the urine.\n3. Entity: Potassium (K+) - This refers to the amount of potassium present in the urine.\n4. Entity: Calcium (Ca2+) - This refers to the amount of calcium present in the urine.\n5. Entity: WT (wild-type) - This refers to a type of mouse that is not genetically modified.\n6. Entity: PKCa (protein kinase C alpha) - This is a gene that encodes a protein that is involved in signal transduction pathways.\n7. Entity: KO (knockout) - This refers to a genetically modified mouse that has been engineered to lack a specific gene, in this case, the PKCa gene.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Lithium\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph are related to the measurement of electrolyte levels in the urine of mice that have been treated with lithium or genetically modified to lack the PKCa gene."},

Calcium: A chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20.\n5. Lithium: A chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3.\n6.
