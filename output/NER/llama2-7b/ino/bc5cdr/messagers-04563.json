Oral contraceptives (OCs) - These are the contraceptive pills that the women in the studies were taking.\n3. Third-generation progestagens - These are the specific type of progestagen hormones used in the oral contraceptives, specifically gestodene and desogestrel.\n4.

Progestagens (plural form of \"progestogen\"): These are a class of synthetic progestins, which are used in oral contraceptives (birth control pills).
