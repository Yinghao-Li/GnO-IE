Context: The paragraph is discussing the effects of a drug called SOD on kidney function.\n2. Definition: Tubular damage refers to damage to the tiny tubes in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n3. Evidence: The paragraph specifically states that SOD did not attenuate (reduce) the tubular damage, indicating that the drug had no effect on the damage that had already occurred.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is \"Tubular damage.\""},
