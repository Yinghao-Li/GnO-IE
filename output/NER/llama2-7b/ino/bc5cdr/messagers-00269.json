Coronary artery disease: This is a disease that affects the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. It can lead to chest pain or discomfort (angina) and can increase the risk of heart attack.\n2. Myocardial disease: This refers to any disease that affects the heart muscle (myocardium). Myocardial infarction (heart attack) is a common type of myocardial disease that occurs when the heart muscle is damaged due to a lack of oxygen.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are coronary artery disease and myocardial disease."},

Cocaine: Cocaine is a highly addictive and illegal drug that is known to cause cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n2. Coronary artery disease: Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become narrowed or blocked, leading to chest pain or a heart attack.\n3. Myocardial infarction: Myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, occurs when the blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked, causing damage or death to the heart muscle.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cocaine\n2. Coronary artery disease\n3. Myocardial infarction"},
