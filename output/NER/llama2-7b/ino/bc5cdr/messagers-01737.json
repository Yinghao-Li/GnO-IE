Heart valve disease: The paragraph mentions \"primary valve surgery\" and \"high-risk surgery,\" which suggests that the study is focused on heart valve disease.\n2. High-risk surgery: The term \"high-risk surgery\" implies that the surgical procedure being referred to is associated with a higher risk of complications or adverse outcomes compared to standard surgical procedures.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"heart valve disease\" and \"high-risk surgery.\""},
