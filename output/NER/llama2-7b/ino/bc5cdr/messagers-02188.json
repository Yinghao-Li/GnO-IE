ATP synthesis: This is a biochemical process that occurs in the mitochondria and is involved in the production of ATP, the primary source of energy for the cell. A decrease in ATP synthesis could indicate a disease or disorder that affects the mitochondria's ability to produce energy.\n2. Mitochondria: These are organelles found in the cells of most eukaryotic organisms, where they generate most of the energy that the cell needs to function. Subsarcolemmal mitochondria are a type of mitochondria found in the sarcolemma, the membrane that surrounds muscle cells.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. ATP synthesis disease: A disease or disorder that affects the ability of the mitochondria to produce ATP.\n2. Mitochondrial disease: A disease or disorder that affects the structure or function of the mitochondria."},
