Kidney disease: The paragraph mentions \"early infections in kidney\" recipients, indicating that the disease entity \"kidney disease\" is present.\n2. Heart disease: The paragraph also mentions \"heart\" recipients, which suggests that the disease entity \"heart disease\" is also present.\n3. Liver disease: The paragraph mentions \"liver\" recipients, which implies that the disease entity \"liver disease\" is also present.\n4. Cyclosporine-associated disease: The paragraph mentions \"cyclosporine,\" which is an immunosuppressive drug commonly used in organ transplantation. The use of this drug can increase the risk of infections and other adverse effects, including those related to the transplanted organ. Therefore, the disease entity \"cyclosporine-associated disease\" can be inferred from the context of the paragraph.\n\nSo, the four disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Kidney disease\n2. Heart disease\n3. Liver disease\n4. Cyclosporine-associated disease"},
