It refers to a condition in which the body becomes resistant to the effects of a drug, in this case, inhaled salbutamol.\n2. \"Asthma\" is a disease entity. It is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by inflammation, airway obstruction, and bronchospasm.\n3. \"Prolonged therapy\" is a disease entity. It refers to the duration of treatment with inhaled salbutamol in asthmatics.\n4. \"High dose\" is a disease entity. It refers to the amount of inhaled salbutamol used in the treatment of asthma.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Tachyphylaxis\n* Asthma\n* Prolonged therapy\n* High dose"},

Tachyphylaxis: This is a medical term that refers to the development of resistance to a drug, in this case, inhaled salbutamol.\n2. Salbutamol: This is the name of the drug being studied in the paragraph. It is a bronchodilator, a type of medication that helps to open up the airways in the lungs.\n3. Asthma: This is the medical condition being studied in the paragraph. It is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which can lead to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.\n4. Airways: These are the passageways through which air moves in and out of the lungs. In the context of the paragraph, the airways are the target of the inhaled salbutamol.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Salbutamol\n* Asthma\n* Airways"},
