Let's identify the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph:\n\n1. mTOR pathway: This is a biochemical pathway that is involved in cellular signaling and metabolism.\n2. markers: These are chemical substances that are used to detect or measure the presence of a particular protein or other molecule in a sample. In this context, the markers are being used to detect the presence of proteins associated with the mTOR pathway.\n3. immunohistochemistry (IHC): This is a chemical technique used to detect the presence of specific proteins in tissue samples. In IHC, antibodies that bind to the protein of interest are used to detect its presence in the tissue.\n4. direct mutation sequencing: This is a chemical technique used to detect genetic mutations in DNA. In this technique, the DNA is directly sequenced to identify the specific mutations present in the sample.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. mTOR pathway\n2. markers (specifically, antibodies used in IHC)\n3. immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n4. direct mutation sequencing"},
