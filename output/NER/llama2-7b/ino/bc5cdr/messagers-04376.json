Cancer\n\nExplanation: The paragraph mentions \"cumulative survival\" which is a common term used in cancer research to describe the percentage of patients who are alive at different time points after diagnosis. The fact that the cumulative survival rate is 88% at 5 years suggests that the disease being referred to is likely cancer, as this is a common cancer survival rate."},
