Iron: Iron is a chemical element that is essential for the production of hemoglobin, which is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia.\n2. Vitamin B12: Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in the production of red blood cells. A deficiency in vitamin B12 can cause anemia.\n3. Folate: Folate is a B vitamin that is essential for the production of red blood cells. A deficiency in folate can cause anemia.\n4. Heme: Heme is a component of hemoglobin that is responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. Heme is derived from the amino acid iron.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Iron\n2. Vitamin B12\n3. Folate\n4. Heme"},
