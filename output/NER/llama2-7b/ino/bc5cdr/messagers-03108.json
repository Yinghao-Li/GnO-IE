Apoptosis: This is the process of programmed cell death, which is a normal and essential process in multicellular organisms. Apoptosis can also be a result of disease or injury.\n2. Cardiac disease: The paragraph mentions \"cardiac histology,\" which is the study of the structure and function of the heart, and \"transmission electron microscopy,\" which is a technique used to study the morphology of cells and tissues at the microscopic level. These techniques are often used to study cardiac disease, such as heart failure or coronary artery disease.\n3. Cancer: The paragraph mentions \"terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay,\" which is a technique used to detect apoptosis in cells. This technique is often used to study cancer, as cancer cells often undergo excessive apoptosis.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Apoptosis\n2. Cardiac disease\n3. Cancer"},
