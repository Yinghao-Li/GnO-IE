Hypothyroidism: This is the condition that the antithyroid drugs are intended to treat.\n2. Hyperthyroidism: This is the opposite of hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\n3. Thyrotoxicosis: This is a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, leading to symptoms such as weight loss, nervousness, and tremors.\n4. Myxedema: This is a severe form of hypothyroidism, characterized by a thickening of the skin, particularly in the neck and face.\n5. Thyroid storm: This is a life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism, characterized by a sudden and severe increase in thyroid hormone production, leading to symptoms such as fever, tremors, and heart problems.\n\nI hope that helps!

Antithyroid drugs: These are medications used to treat hyperthyroidism, which is a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. Common antithyroid drugs include methimazole and propylthiouracil.\n2. Thyroid hormones: The paragraph mentions that antithyroid drugs can cause hypothyroidism, which is a condition where the thyroid gland produces too little thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones include triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).\n3. Iodine: The paragraph mentions that iodine is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones. Iodine is a chemical element with the symbol I and atomic number 53.\n4. Thionamides: These are a class of antithyroid drugs that include methimazole and propylthiouracil. Thionamides work by blocking the production of thyroid hormones.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
