Induction: This refers to the process of inducing a chemical reaction or change, which in this context means the time it takes for a drug to take effect.\n2. Emergence: This refers to the process of emerging or appearing, which in this context means the time it takes for a drug's effects to become apparent after administration.\n3. Respiratory: This refers to the respiratory system, which is made up of the lungs, airways, and breathing muscles. In this context, \"respiratory effects\" refers to the effects of a drug on the respiratory system.\n4. Cardiovascular: This refers to the cardiovascular system, which is made up of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. In this context, \"cardiovascular effects\" refers to the effects of a drug on the cardiovascular system.\n5. Pain: This refers to the sensation of pain, which can be caused by a variety of factors including injury, inflammation, or disease. In this context, \"pain on injection\" refers to the pain caused by the injection of a drug.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
