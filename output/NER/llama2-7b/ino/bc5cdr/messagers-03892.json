It refers to high blood pressure, which can be a symptom of various medical conditions.\n2. \"Neurological deterioration\" is a disease entity. It refers to a decline or worsening of neurological function, which can be caused by various conditions such as stroke, brain injury, or neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypertension\n* Neurological deterioration"},
