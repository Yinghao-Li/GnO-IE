Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n\n* Cortical dysplasia\n* malformation\n* defects\n* proliferation\n* migration\n* maturation\n\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n\n* Cortical dysplasia (disease)\n* malformation (disease)\n* defects (disease)\n* proliferation (process)\n* migration (process)\n* maturation (process)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cortical dysplasia\n* malformation\n* defects\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

Migration - refers to the movement of cells from one location to another.\n3. Maturation - refers to the process of cell maturation or differentiation, where immature cells become specialized and functional.\n\nSo, the three \"chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Proliferation (a cell growth and division process)\n2. Migration (a cell movement process)\n3. Maturation (a cell differentiation process)"},
