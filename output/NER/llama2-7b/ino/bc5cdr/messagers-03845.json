Identify the keywords:\n * Glomeruli\n * PAN (Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma)\n * Controls\n2. Look for the context:\n * The paragraph mentions that the glomeruli of PAN rats contained more CC than the glomeruli of controls, indicating that PAN is a disease that affects the glomeruli.\n3. Identify the entities:\n * Disease: PAN (Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma)\n * Anatomical structure: Glomeruli\n * Control: Controls (a group of rats that are not affected by the disease)\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"PAN\" (Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma)."},
