    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the term \"Disease\" does not appear explicitly. However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that are related to diseases:\n\n1. Prostaglandin: Prostaglandins are inflammatory mediators that are involved in various diseases, including pain, inflammation, and immune disorders.\n2. Corticomedullary gradient: A corticomedullary gradient refers to the distribution of a substance or structure within the brain, particularly in relation to the cortex and medulla oblongata. Abnormalities in this gradient can be associated with various neurological disorders, such as stroke or brain tumors.\n3. Group: In this context, the term \"group\" likely refers to a set of individuals or animals that are being studied or compared in a research experiment.\n\nTherefore, the entities mentioned in the paragraph related to diseases are:\n\n1. Prostaglandin (a disease-related substance)\n2. Corticomedullary gradient (a structure or distribution associated with various neurological disorders)\n3. Group (a set of individuals or animals being studied in a research experiment)."},

Corticomedullary gradient: This is a term used to describe the distribution of prostaglandin synthesis in the brain.
