Identify the types of entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the following types of entities are mentioned:\n\n* \"vesicles\"\n* \"dark granules\"\n* \"cells\"\n* \"epithelial layers\"\n\n2. Determine whether each entity is a \"Disease\" entity or not:\n\na. Vesicles: No, vesicles are not a disease entity. They are a type of membrane-bound structure that can contain various substances, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.\n\nb. Dark granules: No, dark granules are not a disease entity. They are a type of organelle found in cells that contain various types of pigments, such as melanin, which can give them a dark appearance.\n\nc. Cells: No, cells are not a disease entity. They are the basic structural and functional units of living organisms, and they can be affected by various diseases.\n\nd. Epithelial layers: No, epithelial layers are not a disease entity. They are a type of tissue that forms the lining of various body surfaces and organs, and they can be affected by various diseases.\n\nTherefore, the only \"Disease\" entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"cells.\""},
