To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Patients\": This is the first entity mentioned in the paragraph, and it refers to the individuals who are being treated for a disease or condition.\n2. \"Bradykinesia\": This is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a type of movement disorder characterized by slowness and stiffness of movement.\n3. \"Rigidity\": This is another disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a type of movement disorder characterized by stiffness and resistance to movement.\n4. \"UPDRS\": This is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which stands for the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. This is a standardized scale used to measure the severity of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Bradykinesia\n* Rigidity\n* UPDRS\n\nI hope this helps!
