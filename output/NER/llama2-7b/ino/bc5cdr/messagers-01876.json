Ouabain: Ouabain is a toxin found in certain species of snails, and it has been shown to have various biological effects, including inducing hyperlocomotion in rats. Therefore, ouabain can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n2. Hyperlocomotion: Hyperlocomotion is a condition characterized by excessive movement or restlessness. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the increased movement observed in rats injected with ouabain.\n3. Rat: Rats are not typically considered disease entities, but they are often used as experimental animals in scientific research. In this paragraph, the rats are being studied for their response to ouabain, so they can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ouabain\n2. Hyperlocomotion\n3. Rat"},

It is mentioned in the paragraph as the substance that induces hyperlocomotion in rats.\n2. M: This symbol represents the concentration of ouabain being used in the experiment. In this case, the concentrations mentioned are 10(-2) and 10(-3) M.\n3. ICV: This abbreviation stands for \"intracerebroventricular,\" which refers to the injection method used in the experiment. In this case, the ouabain was injected into the cerebroventricular system of the rat.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ouabain\n2. M (concentration of ouabain)\n3.
