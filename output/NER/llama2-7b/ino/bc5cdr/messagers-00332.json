Oxidant stress: The term \"oxidant stress\" refers to a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Oxidant stress can lead to cellular damage and contribute to the development of various diseases.\n2. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity: Aminoglycoside is a type of antibiotic that can cause damage to the inner ear and hearing loss. Ototoxicity refers to the damage caused to the inner ear by exposure to toxic substances, including aminoglycosides."},
