Kidney dysfunction: The paragraph mentions the progressive deterioration of the symptoms and laboratory values, which suggests that the patient's kidneys are not functioning properly.\n3. Renal failure: This is a more severe form of kidney dysfunction, where the kidneys are no longer able to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood effectively.\n4. Dialysis: The paragraph mentions the introduction of haemodialytical therapy, which is a medical procedure used to remove waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to do so. This suggests that the patient's kidneys have failed and dialysis is being used as a substitute.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Nephrotoxicity\n2.
