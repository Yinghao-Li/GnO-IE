Hypertension: The paragraph mentions reducing mean arterial pressure by 30% to 70% of control, which suggests that the dogs are suffering from hypertension or high blood pressure.\n2. Control: The term \"control\" implies that there is a standard or baseline condition against which the effects of the treatment are being measured. In this case, the control group of dogs is likely to be a group of dogs that are not receiving any treatment or intervention.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypertension (or high blood pressure)\n2. Control (the standard or baseline condition against which the effects of the treatment are being measured)"},

It is a nucleotide that provides energy to the cell through the process of cellular respiration.\n2. SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism): SNP is a chemical entity that refers to a specific type of genetic variation that occurs when a single nucleotide (A, C, G, or T) in the DNA sequence of an organism is replaced by another. SNPs are relatively common and can have a significant impact on the functioning of an organism.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, ATP and SNP are the two chemical entities mentioned."},
