Valproate levels: This refers to a specific medication or treatment for a disease or condition. Valproate is a medication used to treat various conditions, including epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and migraines.\n2. Therapeutic levels: This refers to the optimal range of medication levels in the body for the treatment of a disease or condition. Therapeutic levels are typically determined by medical professionals based on the individual patient's needs and medical history.\n3. Normoammonaemia: This refers to a specific laboratory test result. Normoammonaemia means that the patient's levels of ammonia in their blood are within the normal range. Ammonia is a toxic compound that can build up in the body and cause a range of health problems, including brain damage and liver disease.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
