Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is the effect of nifedipine therapy on blood pressure in 13 patients.\n2. Identify the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Blood pressure (a physiological parameter)\n * Hypertension (a disease characterized by elevated blood pressure)\n * Nifedipine (a medication used to treat hypertension)\n3. Are there any other disease entities mentioned indirectly or by implication?\n * No, there are no other disease entities mentioned indirectly or by implication in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypertension\n* Nifedipine\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

Pressure: This is a chemical entity that refers to the force exerted on a surface or inside a container. In this context, it refers to the pressure of blood in the arteries.\n4.
