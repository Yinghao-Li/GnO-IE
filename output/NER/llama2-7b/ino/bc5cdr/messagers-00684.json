Post-transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy: This is a surgical procedure that involves cutting or destroying some of the nerves in the sympathetic nervous system to treat gustatory hyperhidrosis.\n3.

Glycopyrrolate: This is a medication used to treat gustatory hyperhidrosis, which is excessive sweating of the face, mouth, or tongue. It is applied topically to the skin as a pad.\n2. Sympathectomy: This is a surgical procedure that involves cutting or destroying the nerves that transmit signals from the sympathetic nervous system to the sweat glands. This can help to reduce sweating in patients with gustatory hyperhidrosis.\n3. Sympathicotomy: This is a similar procedure to sympathectomy, but it involves cutting or destroying only the sympathetic nerves that are responsible for causing the excessive sweating.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Glycopyrrolate (a medication)\n* Sympathectomy (a surgical procedure)\n* Sympathicotomy (a surgical procedure)"},
