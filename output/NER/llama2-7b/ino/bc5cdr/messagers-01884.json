Anticoagulation: This is a medical condition where the blood's ability to clot is impaired, which can lead to bleeding or clotting complications.\n2. Heparin: Heparin is a medication used to prevent blood clots from forming. It is an anticoagulant, which means it works by blocking the production of clotting factors in the blood.\n3. Regional citrate: This is a type of anticoagulation that uses citrate as the active ingredient to prevent blood clots.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
