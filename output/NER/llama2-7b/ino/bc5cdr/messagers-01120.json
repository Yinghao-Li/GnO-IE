Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Levodopa: Levodopa is a chemical compound that is converted into dopamine in the brain. It is used to treat Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome (RLS).\n2. Dopamine: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in movement, motivation, and reward processing in the brain. It is also involved in the regulation of RLS symptoms.\n3. Dopamine agonists: Dopamine agonists are chemical compounds that mimic the action of dopamine in the brain. They are used to treat conditions such as Parkinson's disease and RLS.\n4. Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists: Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists are chemical compounds that block the action of dopamine at the D2 receptor in the brain. They can induce or aggravate RLS symptoms."},
