Intramuscular: This term refers to a method of administration, but it could also be associated with a disease or condition that affects the muscles.\n\nTherefore, the entities that are related to disease in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. HBIg (potential disease entity)\n2. Intramuscular (method of administration, but also associated with muscle-related diseases)"},

Identify the words that are related to chemicals:\n * Intramuscular\n * HBIg\n2. Check the meanings of these words:\n * Intramuscular means \"within or into a muscle\"\n * HBIg means \"Human Insulin Bovine Insulin Glargine\" (a type of insulin)\n3. Determine if the words are chemical entities:\n * Intramuscular is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical term.\n * HBIg is a chemical entity, as it is a type of insulin.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"HBIg\"."},
