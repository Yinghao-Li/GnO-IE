Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is discussing two cases of amisulpride overdose and their association with prolonged QT syndrome.\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Amisulpride: a drug or medication\n * Overdose: an excessive amount of a drug or medication taken\n * Prolonged QT syndrome: a heart condition characterized by a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG)\n3. Determine whether each entity is a disease or a symptom:\n * Amisulpride: a drug or medication, not a disease\n * Overdose: a symptom of a drug or medication overuse or poisoning\n * Prolonged QT syndrome: a disease or disorder\n4. Identify any other relevant entities mentioned in the paragraph: None mentioned in this case.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Prolonged QT syndrome\n\nI hope this helps!
