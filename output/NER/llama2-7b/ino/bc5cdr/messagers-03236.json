To identify the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Intraocular inflammation\" is a chemical entity because it refers to a type of inflammation that occurs within the eye.\n2. \"Baseline\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a term used to describe a starting point or initial value.\n3. \"6 months\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a time interval.\n4. \"1 year\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a time interval.\n5. \"2 years\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a time interval.\n6. \"3 years\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a time interval.\n7. \"Beyond 3 years\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a time interval.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"Intraocular inflammation\"."},
