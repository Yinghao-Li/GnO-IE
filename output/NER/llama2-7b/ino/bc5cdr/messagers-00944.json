Glucose: This is a simple sugar that is commonly used as a substrate for metabolic tests, including the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Insulin: This is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells. The Bergman minimal model analysis mentioned in the paragraph may involve measuring insulin levels or insulin sensitivity.\n3. Glucagon: This is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels by stimulating the breakdown of glucose in the liver and muscles. The Bergman minimal model analysis may also involve measuring glucagon levels or glucagon sensitivity.\n4. Minimal model analysis: This is a mathematical model used to describe the metabolism of glucose and other nutrients in the body. The Bergman minimal model analysis mentioned in the paragraph is a specific type of mathematical model that is used to evaluate the metabolic function of patients with schizophrenia.\n\nI hope this helps!
