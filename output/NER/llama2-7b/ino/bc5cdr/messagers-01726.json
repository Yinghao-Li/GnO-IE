Glomerulosclerosis: This is a condition where the glomeruli (small blood vessels in the kidneys) become scarred and hardened, leading to kidney damage.\n2. Tubular atrophy: This refers to the shrinkage or wasting of the tubules in the kidneys, which can lead to impaired kidney function.\n3. Interstitial fibrosis: This is a condition where there is excessive scar tissue in the kidneys, leading to stiffness and loss of elasticity in the kidney tissues.\n4. Proteinuria: This is the presence of excess protein in the urine, which can be an indicator of kidney damage or disease.\n5. Chronic renal failure: This is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their function over time, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the body.\n\nI hope this helps!
