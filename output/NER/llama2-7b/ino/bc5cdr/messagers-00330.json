Kanamycin: Kanamycin is a antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. In the context of the paragraph, it is being used as a tool to study the effects of the transgene on the threshold of the organism.\n2. Transgenic group: The term \"transgenic group\" refers to a group of organisms that have been genetically modified to express a specific gene or set of genes. In this case, the transgenic group is likely to be a group of organisms that have been engineered to express a transgene, which is the focus of the study.\n3. Controls: The term \"controls\" refers to a group of organisms that are not genetically modified and serve as a baseline for comparison. In this case, the controls are likely to be a group of organisms that are not transgenic and are used to compare the effects of the transgene on the threshold of the organism.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
