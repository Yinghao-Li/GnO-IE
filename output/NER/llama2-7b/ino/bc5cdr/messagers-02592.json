Gemcitabine: This is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).\n2. Cisplatin: This is another chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including HL.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Gemcitabine and cisplatin are both chemotherapy drugs, which are chemical compounds designed to target and kill cancer cells.\n* They are used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), which is a type of cancer that affects the immune system.\n* The phrase \"non-overlapping toxicity with first-line chemotherapeutics\" suggests that gemcitabine and cisplatin have different side effects compared to other chemotherapy drugs commonly used to treat HL, which means they can be used in combination without causing harmful interactions.\n* The paragraph also mentions that these drugs can be delivered in an outpatient setting, which means they can be administered to patients in a clinic or hospital without the need for hospitalization."},
