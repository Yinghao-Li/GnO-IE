Delta22 - isomer of beta - muricholate: This is a specific type of molecule that is being studied. It is a derivative of a molecule called muricholate, which is a type of lipid (a type of fat molecule). The \"Delta22\" refers to a specific structural feature of the molecule.\n2. P < 0.01: This is a statistical term that indicates the significance level of the difference observed between the control and experimental groups. It is a measure of the probability that the observed difference is due to chance rather than a real effect. In this case, the probability is less than 0.01, indicating a highly significant difference.\n3. EE - treated rats: This refers to rats that have been treated with a specific experimental treatment, which is not further identified in the paragraph.\n4. bile: This is a type of digestive fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. It helps to break down fats and absorbs fat-soluble vitamins.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Delta22 - isomer of beta - muricholate\n* P < 0.01\n* EE - treated rats\n* bile"},
