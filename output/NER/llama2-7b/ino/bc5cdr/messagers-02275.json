Epilepsy: The paragraph mentions \"ictal periods\" in the EEG of rats, which is a common symptom of epilepsy.\n2. Lindane: The paragraph mentions \"lindane\" as a substance that is administered to rats, which is a type of medication used to treat certain skin conditions, including lice infestations.\n3. Neurological disorder: The paragraph mentions \"neurological disorder\" in the context of the rats receiving l-arginine prior to lindane, which suggests that the rats may have a neurological disorder that is being studied.\n\nI hope this helps!
