Pathogenetic: This entity refers to the process of disease causation or the origin of a disease. It is a chemical entity because it is a term used in the field of chemistry to describe the chemical changes that occur in the body as a result of a disease.\n2. Progressive: This entity refers to a process or condition that gradually becomes worse over time. It is a chemical entity because it is a term used in chemistry to describe the gradual change in the chemical composition of a substance over time.\n3. Muscular: This entity refers to muscle tissue or the muscular system in the body. It is a chemical entity because muscle tissue is made up of chemical components such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.\n4. Dystrophy: This entity refers to a type of muscle wasting or degeneration. It is a chemical entity because it is a term used in chemistry to describe the abnormal chemical changes that occur in muscle tissue as a result of disease or injury.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
