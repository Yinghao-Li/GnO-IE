However, based on the context, we can identify the following potential \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. Electrolyte imbalance: The paragraph mentions \"plasma concentrations of electrolytes,\" which could indicate a disorder related to the balance of electrolytes in the body, such as hypokalemia (low potassium levels), hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels), or hypermagnesemia (high magnesium levels).\n2. Other electrolyte disorders: The paragraph does not provide enough information to identify specific electrolyte disorders, but it could be inferred that the study was focused on electrolyte imbalances in general, rather than a specific disorder.\n\nTherefore, the potential \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Electrolyte imbalance\n2. Other electrolyte disorders"},
