Myocardiopathy: This is the disease that the rats were exposed to due to Adriamycin treatment. It refers to a group of diseases that affect the heart muscle, leading to impaired heart function.\n2. Adriamycin: This is the drug that caused the myocardiopathy in the rats. It is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, but it can also have toxic effects on the heart.\n3. Ribose: This is the substance that was studied in relation to its potential protective effects against Adriamycin-induced myocardiopathy in the rats. It is a type of sugar that is involved in the production of ATP, the primary source of energy for the heart."},
