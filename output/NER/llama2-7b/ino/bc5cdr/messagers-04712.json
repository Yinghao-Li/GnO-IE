Cocaine: Cocaine is a drug that can cause cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, and irregular heart rhythms.\n2. Left ventricular dysfunction: The left ventricle is the main pumping chamber of the heart, and dysfunction of this chamber can lead to decreased heart function and decreased blood flow to the body.\n3. Heart failure: Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n4. Diastolic dysfunction: Diastolic dysfunction refers to abnormalities in the relaxation and filling of the heart during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cocaine\n* Left ventricular dysfunction\n* Heart failure\n* Diastolic dysfunction"},

Cocaine: This is the chemical entity being studied in the paragraph. It is a highly addictive and illegal drug that can have serious cardiovascular effects when administered intracoronarily (directly into the coronary arteries).\n2. Coronary arteries: These are the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle itself. The paragraph mentions the intracoronary infusion of cocaine, which means that the drug is being delivered directly into the coronary arteries.\n3. Heart muscle (myocardium): This is the muscle tissue that makes up the walls of the heart. The paragraph mentions the effects of cocaine on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, which refers to the contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle.\n\nI hope this helps!
