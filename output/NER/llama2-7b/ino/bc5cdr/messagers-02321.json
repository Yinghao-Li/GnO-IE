Methamphetamine: This is the drug that is associated with psychosis in the patients mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Psychosis: This is a mental health disorder characterized by a disconnection from reality, resulting in distorted thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors.\n3. Neurotransmitters: The paragraph mentions that methamphetamine can affect the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which can contribute to psychosis. Some examples of neurotransmitters that may be affected by methamphetamine include:\n * Dopamine: This neurotransmitter is involved in reward and pleasure pathways in the brain, and abnormalities in dopamine levels have been linked to psychosis.\n * Serotonin: This neurotransmitter is involved in regulating mood and impulse control, and abnormalities in serotonin levels have been linked to psychosis.\n * Glutamate: This neurotransmitter is involved in learning and memory, and abnormalities in glutamate levels have been linked to psychosis.\n4. Receptors: The paragraph mentions that methamphetamine can affect the levels of certain receptors in the brain, which can contribute to psychosis. Some examples of receptors that may be affected by methamphetamine include:\n * Dopamine receptors: Methamphetamine can increase the levels of dopamine in the brain, which can lead to an overstimulation of dopamine receptors and contribute to psychosis.\n * Serotonin receptors: Methamphetamine can decrease the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can lead to an understimulation of serotonin receptors and contribute to psychosis.\n * Glutamate receptors: Methamphetamine can increase the levels of glutamate in the brain, which can lead to an overstimulation of glutamate receptors and contribute to psychosis.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
