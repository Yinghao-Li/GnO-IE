Real-time refers to the time at which the analysis was performed, which is a temporal concept.\n2. 3D refers to the three-dimensional nature of the imaging technique used, which is a spatial concept.\n3. Echocardiography is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses sound waves to produce images of the heart, which is a chemical process.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
