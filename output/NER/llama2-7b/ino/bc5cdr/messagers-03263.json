However, based on the context, we can identify the following potential disease entities:\n\n1. Lithium-induced disease: Lithium is a medication commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, and it can have side effects on the body. Therefore, it is possible that the animals in the study were treated with lithium to induce a disease or a specific set of symptoms.\n2. Mental illness: Lithium is also used to treat mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder, and it is possible that the animals in the study were treated with lithium to study the effects of the medication on the brain and behavior.\n3. Neurological disorders: Lithium can have neuroprotective effects and can be used to treat neurological disorders such as epilepsy. It is possible that the animals in the study were treated with lithium to study its effects on neurological function.\n\nTherefore, based on the context of the paragraph, the potential disease entities that could be identified are lithium-induced disease, mental illness, and neurological disorders."},
