    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. Isomers: An isomer is a molecule with the same molecular formula but a different arrangement of atoms in its molecular structure. In this paragraph, the isomers of propranolol are being referred to.\n2. Propranolol: Propranolol is a medication that is used to treat various conditions, including high blood pressure, heart failure, and anxiety disorders. It is an example of a disease entity.\n3. Local anaesthetic potencies: Local anaesthetics are medications that are used to numb a specific area of the body. In this paragraph, the local anaesthetic potencies of the isomers of propranolol are being compared.\n4. Isolated frog nerve preparation: A frog nerve preparation is a model used in scientific research to study the effects of drugs on nerve function. In this paragraph, the nerve preparation is being referred to as an isolated preparation.\n5. Procaine: Procaine is a local anaesthetic that is commonly used to numb the skin or mucous membranes before medical procedures. It is an example of a disease entity.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Propranolol\n* Local anaesthetics (including procaine)\n\nThe isomers of propranolol are not disease entities in this context, as they are simply molecules with different structures that have similar properties."},
