Locomotor activity: This refers to the ability of the animals to move around and perform physical activities. In the context of the paragraph, it is being studied under the influence of caffeine.\n2. Righting ability: This refers to the ability of the animals to right themselves after being placed in a rotating position. In the context of the paragraph, it is being studied under the influence of caffeine.\n3. Clonic seizure induction: This refers to the ability of caffeine to induce seizures in the animals.\n4. Stress-induced lethality: This refers to the ability of caffeine to cause death in animals under stressful conditions.\n5. Death without external stress: This refers to the ability of caffeine to cause death in animals without any obvious external stressors.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Locomotor activity\n* Righting ability\n* Clonic seizure induction\n* Stress-induced lethality\n* Death without external stress"},
