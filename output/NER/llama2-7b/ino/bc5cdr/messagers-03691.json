Drug toxicity: The paragraph mentions \"drug toxicity\" as the entity being studied, indicating that it is a disease or adverse effect associated with the use of drugs.\n2. Dose: The paragraph mentions \"dose per body surface area\" which implies that \"dose\" is a disease entity being studied in relation to its effect on body surface area.\n3. Body surface area: The paragraph mentions \"body surface area\" as the context in which the dose is being studied, indicating that it is a disease entity representing the surface area of the body.\n\nTherefore, the three disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Drug toxicity\n2. Dose\n3. Body surface area"},
