Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Median\n * seizure\n * frequency\n * treatment\n * levetiracetam\n * cats\n2. Identify the noun phrases that refer to a disease or medical condition:\n * seizure frequency\n * seizure\n * response to treatment\n3. Identify the disease entities in the paragraph:\n * Seizure frequency (a disease or medical condition characterized by recurrent seizures)\n * Seizure (a disease or medical condition characterized by recurrent seizures)\n * Response to treatment (a disease or medical condition characterized by the body's reaction to a particular treatment)\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Seizure frequency\n* Seizure\n* Response to treatment"},
