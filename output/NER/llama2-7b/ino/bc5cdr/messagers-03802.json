Drug: The paragraph mentions the administration of a drug to patients with acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, the drug is a chemical entity.\n2. Ventricular fibrillation: This is a medical condition that occurs when the heart's ventricles start to quiver or fibrillate instead of beating normally. It is a chemical entity because it is a physiological process that involves abnormal electrical activity in the heart muscle.\n3. Sustained ventricular tachycardia: This is another medical condition that occurs when the heart beats too quickly and irregularly. It is also a chemical entity because it is a physiological process that involves abnormal electrical activity in the heart muscle.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Drug\n2. Ventricular fibrillation\n3. Sustained ventricular tachycardia"},
