To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Glibenclamide\" is a drug or medication.\n2. \"hypotension\" is a disease or medical condition, which refers to low blood pressure.\n3. \"produced by\" suggests that the hypotension is caused by something else, which could be a disease or condition.\n4. \"helodermin\" is a substance or agent that may be causing the hypotension.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypotension (low blood pressure)\n* Helodermin (the substance or agent causing the hypotension)\n\nSo, the paragraph is talking about a rat that is experiencing hypotension due to the effects of the drug glibenclamide, which is caused by the presence of helodermin."},
