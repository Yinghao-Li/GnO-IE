All - trans retinoic acid\n2. inflammatory myositis\n3. acute promyelocytic leukemia\n\nLet me explain each of them:\n\n1. All - trans retinoic acid: This is a form of vitamin A that is used in medical treatment. It is a retinoid, which is a derivative of vitamin A. All-trans retinoic acid is the most active form of retinoic acid and is used to treat various conditions, including acute promyelocytic leukemia.\n2. inflammatory myositis: This is a type of inflammatory disease that affects the muscles. It is characterized by muscle weakness, pain, and swelling. Inflammatory myositis can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.\n3. acute promyelocytic leukemia: This is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is characterized by the excessive proliferation of immature white blood cells called promyelocytes. Acute promyelocytic leukemia is relatively rare and is often treated with chemotherapy, including all-trans retinoic acid."},
