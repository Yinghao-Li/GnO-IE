Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * Subependymal cysts\n * Infants\n * Cocaine\n * Prenatally\n * Group\n2. Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Subependymal cysts (noun phrase)\n * exposed group (noun phrase)\n * unexposed group (noun phrase)\n3. Identify the verbs in the paragraph:\n * incidence\n * compare\n * was\n * p\n4. Identify the adjectives in the paragraph:\n * subependymal\n * prenatally\n * exposed\n * unexposed\n5. Identify the adverbs in the paragraph:\n * compared\n * p\n\nNow, let's analyze the entities in the paragraph:\n\nDisease entities:\n\n1. Subependymal cysts - A type of cyst that occurs in the subependymal region of the brain.\n2. Cocaine - A drug that can cause birth defects and developmental problems in infants if used during pregnancy.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"subependymal cysts\" and \"cocaine\"."},

Prenatally: This is a phrase that refers to the period of time before birth, during which the infants were exposed to cocaine.\n3. Infants: This refers to the babies who were studied in the research.\n4. Group: This refers to the two groups of infants being compared in the study: the exposed group and the unexposed group.\n5. Unexposed group: This refers to the group of infants who were not exposed to cocaine prenatally.\n6. P < 0.01: This is a statistical term that indicates the significance level of the difference between the two groups. It means that the difference between the exposed and unexposed groups is unlikely to occur by chance.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cocaine\n2.
