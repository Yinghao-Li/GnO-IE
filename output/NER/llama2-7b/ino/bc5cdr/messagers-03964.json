Estrogen dose: The paragraph mentions the term \"estrogen dose,\" which is a measure of the amount of estrogen present in the body.\n2. Normalization: The paragraph states that normalization was obtained by halving the estrogen dose. \"Normalization\" in this context likely refers to the process of returning to a normal or healthy state after a disturbance or imbalance.\n\nTherefore, the disease-related entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
