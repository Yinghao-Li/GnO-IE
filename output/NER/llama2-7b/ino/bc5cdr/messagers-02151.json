Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * Morphine\n * CNSB002\n * hyperalgesia\n * inflammatory model\n * neuropathic model\n2. Determine whether each noun refers to a disease or a symptom:\n * Morphine: drug, not a disease\n * CNSB002: drug, not a disease\n * hyperalgesia: symptom (a state of increased sensitivity to pain)\n * inflammatory model: disease (a model used to study inflammation)\n * neuropathic model: disease (a model used to study nerve damage)\n3. Identify the disease entities in the paragraph:\n * Inflammation\n * Neuropathy\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"Inflammation\" and \"Neuropathy\"."},
