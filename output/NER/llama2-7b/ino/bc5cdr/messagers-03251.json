To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"incidence\" refers to the occurrence or frequency of something, in this case, the incidence of visible muscle fasciculation.\n2. \"severity\" refers to the degree or intensity of something, in this case, the severity of visible muscle fasciculation.\n3. \"visible muscle fasciculation\" is a specific symptom or sign of a disease, in this case, a muscle disorder or neuromuscular disease.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Muscle fasciculation (a symptom or sign of a muscle disorder or neuromuscular disease)\n* Muscle disorder (a broader term that encompasses various types of muscle diseases or conditions)\n* Neuromuscular disease (a broader term that encompasses various types of diseases that affect the nerves and muscles)\n\nI hope this helps!
