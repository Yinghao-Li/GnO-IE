Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Nocistatin\n * Nociceptin\n * Normal mice\n2. Determine whether each entity is a disease or not:\n * Nocistatin: Not a disease (it is a drug)\n * Nociceptin: Not a disease (it is a drug)\n * Normal mice: Not a disease (it is a group of animals)\n3. Check if any of the remaining entities are diseases:\n * Retention test: Not a disease (it is a psychological test)\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"Retention test\"."},
