Cardiac muscle: This is a type of muscle that makes up the heart, responsible for pumping blood throughout the body.\n3. Muscle fibers: These are the basic units of muscle tissue, responsible for contracting and relaxing to produce movement.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Rhabdomyolysis\n2.
