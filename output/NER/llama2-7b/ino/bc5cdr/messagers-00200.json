Driving behavior: The paragraph mentions that 7 out of 12 drivers adjusted their driving behavior by reducing their speed on the driving simulator. This suggests that there may be an issue with their driving behavior, which could be related to a disease or condition that affects their ability to drive safely.\n2. Steering accuracy: The paragraph also mentions that the drivers' steering accuracy improved after they adjusted their driving behavior. This could indicate that there was a problem with their steering accuracy, which could be related to a disease or condition that affects their coordination or balance."},
