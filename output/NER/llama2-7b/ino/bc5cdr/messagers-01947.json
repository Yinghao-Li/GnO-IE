Posterior leukoencephalopathy: This is a type of brain disorder characterized by damage to the white matter of the brain, specifically the posterior (back) part of the brain.\n2. Calcineurin-inhibitor-related neurotoxicity: This is a type of toxicity that occurs as a result of exposure to certain medications called calcineurin inhibitors, which are commonly used to prevent rejection in organ transplant patients.\n3. Immunosuppressive agents: These are medications that suppress the immune system to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ.\n4. Liver transplant: This is a surgical procedure to replace a damaged or diseased liver with a healthy donor liver.\n5. Kidney transplant: This is a surgical procedure to replace a damaged or diseased kidney with a healthy donor kidney."},
