Pentylenetetrazole: This is a chemical substance that is used to induce seizures in mice. It is classified as a convulsant and is used as a model for studying epilepsy and other neurological disorders.\n2. Seizures: The paragraph mentions \"seizures\" as a result of administering pentylenetetrazole to the mice. Seizures are a symptom of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, and can be caused by a variety of factors.\n3. Epilepsy: The paragraph mentions \"epilepsy\" as a possible outcome of administering pentylenetetrazole to the mice. Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Pentylenetetrazole\n2. Seizures\n3. Epilepsy"},
