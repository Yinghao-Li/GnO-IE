Inter-individual variation: This refers to the differences between individuals in a population, and is often used to describe the variability in a particular trait or characteristic between individuals.\n2. Intra-individual variation: This refers to the differences within an individual over time or across different measurements of the same trait or characteristic.\n3. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC): This is a statistical measure that is used to assess the degree of association or agreement between two or more groups or measurements. In the context of the paragraph, ICC is used to assess the reproducibility of measurements across volunteers.\n4. Coefficient of variation (CV): This is a statistical measure that is used to express the amount of variation in a measurement or trait relative to its mean value. In the context of the paragraph, CV is used to assess the reproducibility of measurements within volunteers.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
