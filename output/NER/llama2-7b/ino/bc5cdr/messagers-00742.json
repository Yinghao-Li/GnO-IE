Angiotensin - converting enzyme (ACE): This is a chemical enzyme that is responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the body. ACE inhibitors are drugs that block the action of ACE, thereby reducing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.\n2. Angio-tensin: This is the name of the peptide hormone that is produced by the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by ACE. Angio-tensin is a vasoconstrictor that can increase blood pressure by causing blood vessels to constrict.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are ACE and angio-tensin."},
