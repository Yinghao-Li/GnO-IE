Acute heart failure: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, as the study is focused on investigating the effects of isolated MAP on LV dimension and function in patients with acute heart failure.\n2. Left ventricular (LV) dimension: This is a specific aspect of the heart function that is mentioned in the paragraph, as the study is focused on measuring the impact of isolated MAP on LV dimension in patients with acute heart failure.\n3. Left ventricular function: This is another specific aspect of the heart function that is mentioned in the paragraph, as the study is focused on measuring the impact of isolated MAP on LV function in patients with acute heart failure.\n4. Myocardial infarction (MI): Although not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, MI is a possible underlying cause of acute heart failure, and the study may be investigating the effects of isolated MAP on LV dimension and function in patients with a history of MI.\n\nI hope this helps!
