It refers to the abnormality in the structure of epithelial cells, which form the lining of organs and glands in the body.\n2. \"High-dose group\" is not a disease entity, but rather a group of organisms or cells that have been exposed to a high dose of something (in this case, an unknown substance).\n\nSo, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"focal epithelial degeneration.\""},
