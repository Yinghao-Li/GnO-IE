Glucose: The paragraph mentions \"response\" and \"stabilization\" in relation to glucose, which suggests that glucose is being used as a measure of the patients' response to treatment.\n2. Brain (GBM): The paragraph mentions \"unresectable GBM\", which indicates that the study did not show increased benefits in terms of survival for patients with unresectable brain tumors (i.e., glioblastoma multiforme)."},
