Identify the keywords:\n * \"skin tests\"\n * \"positive\"\n * \"delayed reactions\"\n * \"PRC\"\n * \"common chains\"\n2. Determine the relationships:\n * \"skin tests\" are performed on the body to diagnose a disease.\n * \"positive\" results indicate the presence of a disease.\n * \"delayed reactions\" suggest a slower progression of the disease.\n * \"PRC\" is likely an abbreviation for a specific disease or condition.\n * \"common chains\" may refer to a shared characteristic of multiple diseases.\n3. Identify the entities:\n * Based on the keywords and relationships, we can identify the following entities in the paragraph:\n  + Disease: PRC (Positive Reactive Contact Dermatitis)\n  + Symptom: delayed reaction\n  + Body part: skin\n  + Test: skin test\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"PRC\" and \"delayed reaction\"."},
