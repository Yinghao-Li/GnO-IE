Nephrotic syndrome: This is mentioned in the paragraph as \"leukocyturia,\" which is a symptom of nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is a group of symptoms that occur when the kidneys leak large amounts of protein into the urine.\n2. Kidney disease: The paragraph mentions that the serum creatinine levels decreased and the urine albumin/creatinine ratios returned to zero, which suggests that the patient's kidney function improved. This could be due to a kidney disease or disorder.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Nephrotic syndrome\n2. Kidney disease"},
