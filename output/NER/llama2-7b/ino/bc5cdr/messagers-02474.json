Long-term oral galactose treatment: This is a type of intervention or treatment that is being studied in the context of the experiment.\n2. Cognitive deficits: This is a symptom or outcome that is being measured in the experiment. Cognitive deficits refer to problems with mental function, such as memory, attention, and decision-making.\n3. Streptozotocin: This is a toxic substance that is being used in the experiment to induce a disease model in the rats.\n4. Intracerebroventricular: This is a method of administration, where the substance is injected directly into the cerebral ventricles.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Long-term oral galactose treatment\n* Cognitive deficits\n* Streptozotocin\n* Intracerebroventricular"},
