Identify the biological processes or physiological functions mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Adenosine receptor agonists\n  + Activate adenosine receptors\n  + Decrease cocaine-induced locomotor activity\n2. Identify the specific disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Cocaine-induced locomotor activity\n  + A behavioral response to cocaine use\n  + Decreased locomotor activity in response to adenosine receptor agonists\n3. Identify the disease entities that are not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph but can be inferred from the context:\n * Addiction\n  + Cocaine is a drug of abuse\n  + Decreased locomotor activity in response to adenosine receptor agonists may be a sign of withdrawal or tolerance in an addicted individual\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cocaine-induced locomotor activity\n* Addiction"},
