Heterogeneity: This term refers to the variation in the characteristics of a disease or condition among individuals or groups. In this context, \"clinical heterogeneity\" specifically refers to the diversity of symptoms and characteristics of a disease or condition in different patients.\n2. Meta-analysis: This term refers to a statistical method used to combine data from multiple studies to draw more general conclusions. In this paragraph, the author is stating that the clinical heterogeneity of the disease precluded the possibility of conducting a meta-analysis for most outcomes.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Heterogeneity\n2. Meta-analysis"},
