Adenosine receptors: These are the receptors that are affected by the drugs mentioned in the paragraph. There are several subtypes of adenosine receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), but the paragraph specifically mentions A2 adenosine receptors.\n2. DMPX: This is the name of the drug that selectively blocks A2 adenosine receptors.\n3. Caffeine: This is the name of the drug that non-selectively blocks adenosine receptors.\n4. Amphetamine: This is the drug that is affected by the blockade of adenosine receptors.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Adenosine receptors (A2 and non-selective)\n* DMPX (selective blocker of A2 adenosine receptors)\n* Caffeine (non-selective blocker of adenosine receptors)\n* Amphetamine (drug affected by blockade of adenosine receptors)"},
