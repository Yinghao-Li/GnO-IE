Nephrocalcinosis: This is a condition where there is an abnormal buildup of calcium in the kidneys.\n3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): This is a broader term that refers to any type of damage or disorder that affects the kidneys over time, leading to a gradual loss of kidney function.\n4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): This is a sudden and temporary loss of kidney function, often caused by a severe illness or injury.\n5.
