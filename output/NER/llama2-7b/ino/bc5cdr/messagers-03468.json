It refers to abnormal heart rhythms or irregular heartbeats.\n2. \"Strophanthidin\" is a drug that can cause arrhythmias in guinea pigs. Therefore, \"strophanthidin-induced arrhythmias\" is a disease entity.\n3. \"Guinea pig right atria\" is a disease entity. It refers to the specific location in the guinea pig where the arrhythmias are occurring.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Arrhythmias\n* Strophanthidin-induced arrhythmias\n* Guinea pig right atria"},
