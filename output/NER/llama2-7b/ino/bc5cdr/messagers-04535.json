To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Induced lesions\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific type of injury or damage caused by the isoproterenol treatment.\n2. \"Severity of the induced lesions\" - This is also a disease entity, as it refers to the degree or extent of the injury or damage caused by the treatment.\n3. \"Changes in heart weight\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific change in the weight of the heart that occurs as a result of the treatment.\n4. \"Heart weight to body weight ratios\" - This is also a disease entity, as it refers to a specific ratio of the weight of the heart to the weight of the body that occurs as a result of the treatment.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Induced lesions\n* Severity of the induced lesions\n* Changes in heart weight\n* Heart weight to body weight ratios"},

Isoproterenol: This is a chemical substance that is used as a medication to treat various conditions, including asthma and heart failure. It is a beta-adrenergic agonist, which means it stimulates the beta-adrenergic receptors in the body.\n2. Lesions: This is a general term for any abnormality or damage in an organ or tissue. In the context of the paragraph, \"lesions\" refers to the damage caused by the isoproterenol treatment.\n3. Heart: This is a chemical entity that refers to the organ that pumps blood throughout the body.\n4. Weight: This is a chemical entity that refers to the mass of an object or organism. In the context of the paragraph, \"weight\" refers to the mass of the heart.\n5. Body: This is a chemical entity that refers to the entire organism or living being. In the context of the paragraph, \"body\" refers to the organism being studied.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Isoproterenol\n* Lesions\n* Heart\n* Weight\n* Body"},
