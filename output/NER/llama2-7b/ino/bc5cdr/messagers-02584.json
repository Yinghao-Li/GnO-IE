Diazinon: This is a toxic chemical that can cause a range of health problems, including damage to the nervous system, liver, and kidneys. Prolonged exposure to diazinon can lead to the development of certain diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders.\n2. Cholesterol: Elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood can lead to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition in which plaque builds up in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n3. Triglycerides: High levels of triglycerides in the blood can also increase the risk of heart disease, as they can contribute to the formation of plaque in the arteries.\n4. LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein): Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood can increase the risk of heart disease, as it can contribute to the formation of plaque in the arteries.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Diazinon poisoning\n2. Atherosclerosis\n3. Heart disease\n4. Stroke"},

Cholesterol: This is a type of lipid that is present in the bloodstream. It is increased in the body due to exposure to diazinon.\n3. Triglycerides: These are another type of lipid that are present in the bloodstream. They are also increased in the body due to exposure to diazinon.\n4. LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein): This is a type of lipoprotein that carries cholesterol and triglycerides in the bloodstream.
