Hypoactivity: This refers to a decrease in motor activity, which can be a symptom of various diseases or conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or neurodegenerative disorders.\n2. Hyperactivity: This refers to an excessive or abnormal increase in motor activity, which can be a symptom of various diseases or conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mania, or schizophrenia.\n3. Morphine-induced hypoactivity: This refers to a decrease in motor activity that is caused by the administration of morphine, which is a drug that is commonly used to treat pain.\n4. Morphine-induced secondary hyperactivity: This refers to an excessive or abnormal increase in motor activity that is caused by the administration of morphine.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are hypoactivity, hyperactivity, morphine-induced hypoactivity, and morphine-induced secondary hyperactivity."},
