Myocardial infarction: This is a type of heart attack caused by the blockage of a coronary artery, which leads to the death of heart muscle cells.\n2. Isoproterenol: This is a medication that is used to simulate the effects of adrenaline on the body. It is often used in research studies to induce certain physiological effects.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, we have two disease entities: myocardial infarction and isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction."},
