Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) - This is a surgical procedure used to treat various conditions affecting the sinuses, such as chronic sinusitis, nasal polyps, and sinus tumors.\n2. Intraoperative bleeding - This refers to bleeding that occurs during the surgical procedure, which can be a complication in various diseases and conditions.\n3. Intraoperative blood pressure - This refers to the blood pressure of the patient during the surgical procedure, which can be affected by various factors, including disease states such as hypotension (low blood pressure).\n4. Propofol - This is a medication used for inducing and maintaining anesthesia, and it is often used in combination with other anesthetics such as remifentanil.\n5. Remifentanil - This is a medication used for inducing and maintaining anesthesia, and it is often used in combination with other anesthetics such as propofol.\n6. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) - This is a type of anesthesia in which all anesthetic medications are administered intravenously, rather than through inhalation or other routes.\n\nI hope this helps!
