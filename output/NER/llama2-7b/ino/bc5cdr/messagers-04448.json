Peptic ulcer disease\n\nExplanation: The paragraph mentions the treatment of peptic ulcer disease with large amounts of calcium and alkali, which led to the discovery of milk-alkali syndrome. Peptic ulcer disease is a condition where a sore develops in the lining of the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine).\n\n2. Milk-alkali syndrome\n\nExplanation: Milk-alkali syndrome is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that can occur when a person consumes large amounts of calcium and alkali through milk or other dairy products. This can lead to an imbalance of electrolytes in the body, including a drop in potassium levels and an increase in sodium levels.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

Calcium: Calcium is a chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20. It is a essential mineral that is found in many foods, including milk.\n2. Alkali: Alkali is a term used to describe a class of chemicals that are capable of neutralizing acids.
