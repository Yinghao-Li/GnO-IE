Vasogenic edema: This is the disease entity that is being described in the paragraph. It refers to a type of edema (swelling) that occurs due to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and the infiltration of fluid into the affected area.\n2. Stroke-related neurodegeneration (SNR): This is the disease entity that the vasogenic edema is occurring in. It refers to the damage or degeneration of brain tissue that occurs as a result of a stroke.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are vasogenic edema and stroke-related neurodegeneration (SNR)."},

Vasogenic: This is a type of edema, which is a fluid buildup in the tissue.
