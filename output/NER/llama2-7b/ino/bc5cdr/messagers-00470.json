It refers to the presence of white blood cells in the urine for an extended period of time.\n2. \"Indinavir\" is a drug entity. It is a medication used to treat HIV infection.\n3. \"Peak serum level\" is a disease entity. It refers to the highest concentration of a drug or other substance in the bloodstream.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Persistent leukocyturia\n* Indinavir\n* Peak serum level\n\nI hope this helps!
