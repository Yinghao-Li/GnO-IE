Uncoupling effect: This refers to the disruption in the normal coupling between oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain, which is a hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction.\n2. Mitochondrial abnormalities: This term encompasses a range of structural and functional changes that occur in mitochondria as a result of exposure to cocaine. These changes can include alterations in mitochondrial shape, membrane potential, and protein function.\n3. Pathological response: This term refers to the complex and multifactorial changes that occur in the body in response to cocaine exposure, including changes in gene expression, metabolism, and cellular signaling pathways.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mitochondrial dysfunction\n2. Mitochondrial abnormalities\n3. Pathological response"},

Cocaine: This is a drug that is known to affect the mitochondria and cause oxidative phosphorylation abnormalities.\n2. Oxidative phosphorylation: This is a process by which cells generate energy through the transfer of electrons from high-energy molecules to oxygen, resulting in the production of ATP.\n3. Mitochondria: These are organelles found in the cells that are responsible for generating energy through oxidative phosphorylation.\n4. ATP: This is the primary energy currency of the cell, which is produced through the process of oxidative phosphorylation.\n5. Oxygen: This is the molecule that is used in the process of oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cocaine\n* Oxidative phosphorylation\n* Mitochondria\n* ATP\n* Oxygen"},
