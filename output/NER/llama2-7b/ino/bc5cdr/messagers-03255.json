PKC-alpha: This is the protein kinase C-alpha, which is an enzyme that plays a role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways. The absence of PKC-alpha is mentioned in the paragraph as a factor that attenuates (weakens) the effect of lithium on nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\n2. PKC-alpha deficiency"},
