To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Tdp\" - This could be an abbreviation for a disease or condition, so let's see if we can find any information about it.\n2. \"LAD\" - This could be an abbreviation for a disease or condition as well, or it could be a term used in the context of the paragraph to refer to something else.\n3. \"age\" - This is a common term that refers to the age of a person, so it's not likely to be a disease entity.\n\nBased on the information provided in the paragraph, the possible disease entities are:\n\n* Tdp (Tardive Dyskinesia) - a movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, and limbs\n* LAD (Late-Onset Dementia) - a type of dementia that occurs in older adults\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are Tdp and LAD."},
