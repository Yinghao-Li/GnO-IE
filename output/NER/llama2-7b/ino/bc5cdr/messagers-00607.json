To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Hyperventilation maneuver\": This is a specific medical procedure that is being performed on the rats in the study. It is not a disease entity.\n2. \"Pilocarpine\": This is a drug that is being used in the study. It is a medication that is used to treat various conditions, including glaucoma and epilepsy, but it is not a disease entity.\n3. \"Control rats\": These are rats that are not receiving the pilocarpine treatment. They are being used as a comparison group to evaluate the effects of the hyperventilation maneuver on the pilocarpine-treated rats.\n4. \"Decrease in spontaneous ventilation\": This is a specific physiological effect that is observed in the rats after the hyperventilation maneuver. It is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"pilocarpine-treated rats\"."},
