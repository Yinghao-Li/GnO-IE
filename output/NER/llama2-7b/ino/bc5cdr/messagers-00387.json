To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"myometrial cells\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific type of cell in the uterus that is involved in the contraction and relaxation of the muscle.\n2. \"relaxant effects\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the ability of something (in this case, nitric oxide) to reduce muscle tension or contraction.\n3. \"nitric oxide\" - This is a disease entity, as it is a molecule that has been implicated in various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and cancer.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"myometrial cells\"\n* \"relaxant effects\"\n* \"nitric oxide\""},
