In this paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Disease\":\n\n1. 4HNE protein adducts: This is the disease entity being studied in the paragraph. 4HNE (4-hydroxynonenal) is a reactive aldehyde that can form adducts with proteins, leading to oxidative stress and potentially contributing to various diseases.\n2. Mitochondria: The paragraph mentions that 4HNE protein adducts appear in mitochondria, which are organelles found in the cells of most eukaryotic organisms. Mitochondria are involved in energy production and are also implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic disorders.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. 4HNE protein adducts\n2. Mitochondria"},
