Nifedipine: This is the chemical name of the drug being mentioned, which is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker used to treat angina and hypertension.\n2. Calcium: This is a chemical element mentioned in the context of nifedipine's mechanism of action, as it is a calcium channel blocker that blocks the influx of calcium ions into the muscle cell, leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle and reduction of vascular resistance.\n3. Hypertension: This is a medical condition characterized by elevated blood pressure, which can be caused by various chemical and physiological factors.\n4. Angina: This is a medical condition characterized by chest pain or discomfort due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, which can be caused by chemical and physiological factors.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are nifedipine, calcium, hypertension, and angina."},
