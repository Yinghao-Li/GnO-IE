Microglial cells: This is a type of cell in the brain that is involved in the immune response and the clearance of neurotoxic substances.\n2. CCR2: This is a protein that is expressed on the surface of immune cells, including microglial cells.\n3. SE rats: This likely refers to a specific strain of rat that is used in scientific research, but without more context it's difficult to determine which strain is being referred to.\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"CCR2\"."},
