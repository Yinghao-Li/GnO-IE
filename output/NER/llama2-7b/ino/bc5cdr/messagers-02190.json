MitoQ: This is a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, which is the main entity being studied in the paragraph.\n2. Antioxidant: This is a class of chemicals that neutralize oxidizing agents, such as free radicals, and are often used to protect cells from oxidative damage.\n3. Mitochondria: These are organelles found in the cells of most eukaryotic organisms, where they generate most of the energy the body needs to function.\n4. Diastolic dysfunction: This is a type of heart failure characterized by a decrease in the heart's ability to relax and fill with blood during diastole (the relaxation phase of the heartbeat).\n5. Conductance catheter: This is a medical device used to measure the pressure-volume relationship of the heart during diastole.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
