To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Cromakalim\" and \"pinacidil\" are both drugs that are used to treat a specific disease entity, which is:\n * Hypertension (high blood pressure)\n2. \"Nitroglycerin\" is a drug that is used to treat a specific disease entity, which is:\n * Angina pectoris (chest pain)\n3. \"Coronary blood flow\" and \"coronary vascular resistance\" are related to the disease entity of:\n * Coronary artery disease (CAD)\n4. \"Heart rate\" is related to the disease entity of:\n * Cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms)\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypertension (cromakalim and pinacidil)\n* Angina pectoris (nitroglycerin)\n* Coronary artery disease (coronary blood flow, coronary vascular resistance)\n* Cardiac arrhythmias (heart rate)"},
