Neuronal gene expression: This refers to the regulation of genes that are involved in the function and development of neurons.\n2. Visceral sensory pathways: These are the pathways that transmit sensory information from the internal organs to the brain.\n3. Urinary tract: This refers to the system of organs that produce, store, and eliminate urine, including the kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra.\n4. Pathological changes: These are abnormalities or disorders in the structure or function of the urinary tract.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Neuronal gene expression\n* Visceral sensory pathways\n* Urinary tract\n* Pathological changes (or abnormalities) in the urinary tract."},
