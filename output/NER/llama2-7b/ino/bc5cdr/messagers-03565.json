Cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which is characterized by the detachment of the urothelium, edema, and muscle necrosis in the bladder.\n2. Cystitis: This is a broader term that refers to inflammation of the bladder. The paragraph specifically mentions \"fully developed cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis,\" which suggests that the disease has progressed to a more advanced stage.\n3. Urothelium: This is a type of epithelial lining that covers the inner surface of the bladder and ureters. The paragraph mentions the detachment of the urothelium, which is a hallmark of cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis.\n4. Microvascular bed: This refers to the network of small blood vessels that supply the bladder and ureters. The paragraph mentions damage to the microvascular bed, which contributes to the edema and muscle necroses in the bladder.\n5. Muscle necroses: This refers to the death of muscle tissue in the bladder. The paragraph mentions focal muscle necroses, which are areas of damaged muscle tissue in the bladder."},
