It is a chemical compound used to treat stress incontinence in women.\n2. Urethral pressure: This refers to the pressure exerted on the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the body. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the maximum pressure that can be applied to the urethra.\n3. Placebo: This is a substance that has no active therapeutic effect, but is used as a control in clinical trials to compare the effects of the actual drug being studied. In this case, the placebo is being used to compare the effects of methoxamine on urethral pressure.\n4. Double-blind crossover: This is a study design in which neither the participants nor the researchers know which group the participant is in (the drug group or the placebo group). This design is used to minimize bias and ensure that the results are due to the actual drug being studied and not to any other factor.\n\nI hope this helps!
