It refers to the study of the abnormal functions and changes that occur in the body as a result of disease.\n2. \"Underlying\" is a preposition that indicates the cause or origin of something. In this case, it suggests that the acute hepatic injury has an underlying cause or mechanism that is not yet understood.\n3. \"Acute hepatic injury\" is a disease entity. It refers to a sudden and severe damage to the liver, which can be caused by various factors such as drug toxicity, viral infections, or alcohol abuse.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Pathophysiology\n* Acute hepatic injury"},

Pathophysiology: This is a term that refers to the study of the abnormal functions of living organisms, including the changes that occur in the body as a result of disease or injury. Pathophysiology is a branch of medicine that deals with the chemical and physical changes that occur in the body during disease.\n2. Injury: This term refers to any type of damage or harm that occurs to the body, including chemical injuries. In the context of the paragraph, the term \"injury\" is used to describe the unknown cause of the acute hepatic injury.\n\nSo, the two \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
