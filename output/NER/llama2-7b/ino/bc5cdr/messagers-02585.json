ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation: This is a cellular process that is involved in various signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK pathway. Abnormalities in ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic disorders.\n2. LDLr transcript: LDLr is a gene that codes for the low-density lipoprotein receptor, which is involved in the transport of cholesterol and other lipids in the bloodstream. Abnormalities in LDLr expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation disorder\n2. LDLr transcript abnormality"},

ERK1/2: These are protein kinases that are involved in various cellular signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK pathway. In the paragraph, the activity of these proteins is mentioned as being decreased by diazinon.\n3. LDLr: This is a transcript that is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. In the paragraph, the transcript is mentioned as being decreased by diazinon.\n\nTherefore, the three chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Diazinon\n2. ERK1/2\n3. LDLr"},
