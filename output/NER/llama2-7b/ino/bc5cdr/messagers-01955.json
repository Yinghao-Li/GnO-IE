Autoimmune disorders: These are diseases in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues in the body, leading to inflammation and damage.\n3. Organ transplant rejection: This is a condition in which the immune system recognizes the transplanted organ as foreign and mounts an immune response against it, leading to rejection of the transplant.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Calcineurin inhibitor\n2. Autoimmune disorders\n3. Organ transplant rejection"},
