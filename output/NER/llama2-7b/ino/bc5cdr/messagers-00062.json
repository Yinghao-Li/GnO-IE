Psychosis: The paragraph mentions the development of new atypical antipsychotic agents, which are drugs used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.\n2. Schizophrenia: This is a mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.\n3. Dopaminergic system: This refers to the system in the brain that produces and regulates the neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays a role in mood, motivation, and movement.\n4. Serotonergic system: This refers to the system in the brain that produces and regulates the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is involved in mood, appetite, and sleep.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
