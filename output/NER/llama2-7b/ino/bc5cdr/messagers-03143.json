Hypertension: The paragraph mentions the drug metoprolol, which is a beta-blocker commonly used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).\n2. Heart rate: The paragraph mentions the heart rate of the patient, which is an important indicator of cardiovascular health. Abnormal heart rate can be a sign of various cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, arrhythmias, and heart failure.\n\nTherefore, the potential disease entities in the paragraph are hypertension and heart rate abnormalities."},
