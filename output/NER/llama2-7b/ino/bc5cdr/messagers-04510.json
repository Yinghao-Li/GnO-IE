Neurodegenerative disease: The paragraph mentions \"neurodegenerative disease\" without providing further details. This could refer to any type of disease that affects the brain and leads to degeneration of neural tissue.\n2. Alzheimer's disease: The paragraph mentions \"apomorphine,\" which is a drug commonly used to treat Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that the study may be focused on Alzheimer's disease.\n3. Parkinson's disease: The paragraph also mentions \"apomorphine,\" which is also used to treat Parkinson's disease. This suggests that the study may be focused on both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Neurodegenerative disease\n2. Alzheimer's disease\n3. Parkinson's disease"},
