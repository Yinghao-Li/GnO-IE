Ouabain: Ouabain is a toxic compound that can cause cardiac glycoside poisoning, which can lead to various cardiac problems, including arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and even death.\n2. ICV: ICV stands for intracerebral ventricular, which refers to the injection of a substance directly into the cerebral ventricles of the brain. This can be a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure for various neurological conditions, such as brain tumors, infections, or cerebral edema.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph is discussing the effects of ouabain injection on locomotion in an open-field test, with a focus on the potential effects of this toxic compound on the brain and nervous system."},
