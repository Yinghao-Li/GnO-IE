Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Bilateral visual field constriction\n * patients\n * VGB\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Bilateral visual field constriction: disease\n * patients: people, individuals\n * VGB: VGB (unspecified)\n3. Identify the verbs in each noun phrase:\n * Bilateral visual field constriction: observed\n * patients: taking, previously took, no exposure to\n * VGB: is/was taking\n4. Identify the adjectives in each noun phrase:\n * Bilateral visual field constriction: bilateral, visual, field\n * patients: current, previous, no\n * VGB: unspecified\n5. Identify the prepositional phrases in each noun phrase:\n * Bilateral visual field constriction: in\n * patients: currently taking, previously took, no exposure to\n * VGB: is/was taking\n6. Identify the disease entities in the paragraph:\n * Bilateral visual field constriction: a disease or condition that affects the visual field\n * patients: individuals who have the disease or condition\n * VGB: the drug or substance that is associated with the disease or condition (in this case, VGB is the unspecified drug being studied)\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Bilateral visual field constriction\n* patients\n* VGB"},
