Gastrointestinal - This is a general term that refers to the digestive system, which includes the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and other organs involved in digestion and nutrient absorption.\n2. Parkinson's disease (PD) - Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. It is caused by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.\n3. Pathophysiology - This term refers to the study of the changes that occur in the body as a result of disease or injury. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the study of the changes that occur in the gastrointestinal system in Parkinson's disease.\n\nNote: In this context, \"chemical\" refers to the chemical changes that occur in the body as a result of the disease or injury, rather than the chemical composition of the entities themselves."},
