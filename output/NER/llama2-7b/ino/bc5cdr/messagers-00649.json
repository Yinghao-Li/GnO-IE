Parkinson's disease: The paragraph mentions \"off\" phase symptoms, which are a common symptom of Parkinson's disease.\n2. Axial symptoms: The paragraph mentions \"axial symptoms,\" which could refer to any disease that affects the axial skeleton (the bones of the spine, ribs, and pelvis). However, in the context of Parkinson's disease, \"axial symptoms\" typically refer to rigidity, bradykinesia (slow movement), and tremors.\n3. Levodopa: The paragraph mentions \"levodopa requirements,\" which is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease. Levodopa is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps to replace the dopamine that is lost in Parkinson's disease.\n\nTherefore, the entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Parkinson's disease\n2. Axial symptoms\n3. Levodopa"},
