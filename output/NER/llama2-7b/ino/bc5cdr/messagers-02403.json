BPA (Bisphenol A) - a toxic chemical that can cause various health problems, including neurological disorders.\n2. Hippocampus - a part of the brain that plays a key role in memory and emotion regulation, and is affected in various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and depression.\n3. Prefrontal cortex - a part of the brain involved in decision-making, planning, and other higher-level cognitive functions, and is affected in disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.\n4. Hypothalamus - a part of the brain involved in regulating various bodily functions, including appetite, sleep, and body temperature, and is affected in disorders such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome.\n5. Cerebellum - a part of the brain involved in coordination, balance, and movement, and is affected in disorders such as cerebellar ataxia and multiple sclerosis.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are BPA, Alzheimer's disease, ADHD, schizophrenia, hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, and multiple sclerosis."},
