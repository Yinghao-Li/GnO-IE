Uraemia: This refers to the presence of excess waste products in the blood, particularly urea, which is a byproduct of protein metabolism.\n2. ADR nephropathy: This is a type of kidney disease that is caused by the use of certain medications, known as adverse drug reactions (ADRs).\n3. SHR: This stands for Sprague-Dawley rat, which is a commonly used animal model in scientific research.\n\nSo, the paragraph is suggesting that the drug Losartan has a beneficial effect on uraemia and urea clearance in advanced ADR nephropathy in SHR."},
