Subcellular cardiomyocyte degeneration refers to the breakdown or death of the cardiomyocytes (the muscle cells of the heart) at the subcellular level.\n2. Progressive functional decline refers to the gradual loss of the heart's ability to pump blood and perform its other functions.\n3. Histopathological manifestations refer to the visible changes that can be observed in the heart tissue under a microscope, such as inflammation, scarring, or other abnormalities."},

Functional decline: This refers to a decrease in the function or activity of something, in this case, the progressive decline in the function of cardiomyocytes.\n3. Histopathological manifestations: This refers to the visible changes or abnormalities that can be observed in a tissue or organ under a microscope, in this case, the histopathological changes that occur in the cardiomyocytes.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
