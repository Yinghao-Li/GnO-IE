Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Streptococcal organisms\n * Capnocytophaga\n * Brevibacterium\n * patient\n2. Determine whether each noun phrase is a disease entity or not:\n * Streptococcal organisms: Yes, a disease entity (a type of bacteria that can cause infection)\n * Capnocytophaga: Yes, a disease entity (a type of bacteria that can cause infection)\n * Brevibacterium: Yes, a disease entity (a type of bacteria that can cause infection)\n * patient: No, not a disease entity (a person who has the infection)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Streptococcal infection\n* Capnocytophaga infection\n* Brevibacterium infection"},
