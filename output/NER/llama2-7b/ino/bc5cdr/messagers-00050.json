Aplastic anemia: This is the disease that is being studied in the context of remoxipride-induced apoptosis. Aplastic anemia is a rare blood disorder characterized by a decrease in the production of blood cells in the bone marrow.\n2. HL60 cells: These are a type of cancer cell line that are commonly used in scientific research to study the effects of drugs and other compounds on cellular processes.\n3. CD34 + / CD19 - human bone marrow progenitor cells: These are a type of stem cell that is found in the bone marrow. They are involved in the production of blood cells and have the potential to differentiate into various cell types, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\nI hope this helps!

Metabolites: These are the byproducts of a chemical reaction, in this case, the breakdown products of remoxipride.\n3. Apoptosis: This is a type of programmed cell death, which is a normal process in multicellular organisms.\n4. HL60 cells: These are a type of cancer cell line that is often used in scientific research.\n5. CD34 + / CD19 - human bone marrow progenitor cells: These are a type of stem cell that is found in the bone marrow.
