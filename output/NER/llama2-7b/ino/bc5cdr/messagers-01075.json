HT (High-dose hormone therapy) - a chemical substance used in hormone replacement therapy.\n2. Hormones - chemical messengers in the body that regulate various physiological processes, including growth and development, metabolism, and reproductive functions.\n3. Colon cancer - a type of cancer that affects the colon or large intestine, which is a type of chemical reaction.\n4. Chemical reaction - a process in which chemical substances interact with each other to form new substances, which is a broader category that includes the previous three entities.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
