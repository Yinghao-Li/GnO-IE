Sclerosis - a disease characterized by the hardening or thickening of tissues.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. PAN (Pancreatitis): The paragraph mentions \"chronic PAN treatment,\" indicating that the disease is ongoing and has been present for some time.\n2. Sclerosis: The paragraph suggests that the increased CC uptake in certain areas of the kidney may lead to the development of sclerosis, which is a disease characterized by the hardening or thickening of tissues.\n\nNote: CC stands for \"cluster of differentiation,\" which is a protein marker used to identify specific cell types in the immune system. In this context, the term \"CC\" refers to the specific type of cell being studied, rather than the disease entity."},

CC: This stands for \"cluster of differentiation,\" which is a term used to describe a protein or other molecule that is involved in cellular differentiation or immune response. In this context, \"CC\" likely refers to a specific type of protein or molecule that is involved in the immune response to pancreatitis.\n2. mesangium: This is a term used to describe the connective tissue that surrounds the glomeruli (small blood vessels) in the kidney.\n3. PAN: This stands for \"pancreatitis,\" which is inflammation of the pancreas.\n4. sclerosis: This is a term used to describe the hardening or thickening of tissue, often as a result of inflammation or scarring.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* CC (cluster of differentiation)\n* mesangium (connective tissue surrounding glomeruli in the kidney)\n* PAN (pancreatitis)\n* sclerosis (hardening or thickening of tissue)"},
