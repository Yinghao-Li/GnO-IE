Mitochondrial injury: The paragraph suggests that mitochondria are the site of intracellular injury, implying that there is a disease or damage affecting the mitochondria.\n2. Intracellular injury: The term \"intracellular injury\" refers to any type of damage or disease that occurs within a cell, including damage to cellular organelles such as mitochondria.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities identified in the paragraph are \"Mitochondrial injury\" and \"Intracellular injury\"."},

Progressive: This is an abstract concept representing the gradual and continuous nature of mitochondrial injury. It is not a physical entity but rather a chemical process.\n2. Injury: This term refers to the damage or harm caused to mitochondria, which can be caused by various chemical reactions or processes.\n3. Mitochondria: These are organelles found in the cells of most eukaryotic organisms, and they play a crucial role in generating energy for the cell through the process of cellular respiration. Mitochondria are not chemical entities in the classical sense, but they are involved in chemical reactions and processes that can be affected by chemical substances.\n4. Intracellular: This term refers to the location of mitochondria within the cell, and it is a chemical concept that describes the position of mitochondria relative to other cellular structures.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Progressive\n2. Injury\n3. Mitochondria\n4. Intracellular"},
