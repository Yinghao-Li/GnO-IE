VTE (Venous Thromboembolism): This is a type of blood clot that occurs in the veins, which can be life-threatening if it breaks loose and travels to the lungs.\n2. OCs (Oral Contraceptives): This refers to birth control pills that contain hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.\n3. Desogestrel: This is a type of progestin, a synthetic hormone that is used in some oral contraceptives.\n4. Ethinyloestradiol: This is another type of estrogen that is used in some oral contraceptives.\n5. Third-generation progestagens: This refers to a class of progestins that are used in some oral contraceptives, including desogestrel and ethinyloestradiol.\n\nSo, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are VTE and OCs, which are related to the use of oral contraceptives."},
