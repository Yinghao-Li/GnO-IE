It refers to a condition where there is an abnormality in the blood's nitrogen content, typically due to kidney dysfunction.\n2. \"Bacterial infections\" is a disease entity. It refers to any infection caused by bacteria, which can affect various parts of the body.\n3. \"Dehydration\" is a disease entity. It refers to a condition where the body loses more fluids than it takes in, leading to a deficit in body water and electrolytes.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Azotemia\n* Bacterial infections\n* Dehydration"},

Azotemia: This is a chemical term that refers to a condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of nitrogen-containing compounds in the blood.\n2. Bacterial infections: Bacteria are microorganisms that can cause infections in the body, and the term \"bacterial infections\" refers to the presence of these microorganisms in the body.\n3. Dehydration: Dehydration is a chemical process that occurs when the body loses more fluids than it takes in, causing an imbalance in the body's water and electrolyte levels.\n\nTherefore, the three chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
