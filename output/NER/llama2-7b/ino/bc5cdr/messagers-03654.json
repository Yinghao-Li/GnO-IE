Fatal side effects: The paragraph specifically highlights the rare but potentially fatal side effects of carbamazepine. Fatal side effects are those that can cause death or are life-threatening.\n3. Laboratory monitoring: The paragraph mentions \"laboratory monitoring\" as a way to better prevent the potentially fatal side effects of carbamazepine. Laboratory monitoring refers to the use of medical tests and procedures to diagnose and monitor a patient's condition.\n4.
