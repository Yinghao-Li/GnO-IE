    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Alzheimer's disease (sAD) - This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a type of dementia caused by the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain.\n2. Dementia - This is a broader term that refers to a group of symptoms characterized by memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with communication and problem-solving.\n3. Insulin-receptor (IR) system - This is a specific system in the body that is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism.\n4. Glucose transporter GLUT4 - This is a specific protein that plays a key role in the transport of glucose into cells, particularly in the brain.\n5. Glucose metabolism - This refers to the various processes involved in the breakdown and use of glucose by cells in the body.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
