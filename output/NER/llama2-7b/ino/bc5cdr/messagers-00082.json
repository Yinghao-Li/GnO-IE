Coronary artery disease: This is a disease of the blood vessels that supply the heart, characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which can lead to chest pain or discomfort (angina) or a heart attack.\n3. Normal left ventricular function: This refers to the fact that the left ventricle of the heart is functioning normally, which is a normal finding in patients with stable angina.\n\nTherefore, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Angina\n2. Coronary artery disease\n\nNote that \"stable angina\" is also a disease entity, but it is not explicitly mentioned as a separate entity in the paragraph."},

Angina - a type of chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood.\n2. Coronary artery disease - a condition in which the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become narrowed or blocked, leading to a reduction in blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart.\n3. Normal left ventricular function - a term used to describe the heart's ability to pump blood effectively and efficiently.\n\nThese entities are all chemical entities because they are related to the chemical processes that occur within the body, specifically in the heart and blood vessels."},
