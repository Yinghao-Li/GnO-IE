Melphalan: This is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including multiple myeloma and lymphoma. It works by killing cancer cells or slowing their growth.\n2. Amyloidosis: This is a group of diseases characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins (amyloid) in organs and tissues. Primary systemic amyloidosis is a type of amyloidosis that occurs when abnormal proteins are produced in the bone marrow and accumulate in various organs, including the kidneys, liver, and heart.\n3.
