It is a synthetic compound that contains the amino acid arginine with a nitro group (-NO2) attached to the alpha carbon atom.\n3. Nitric oxide (NO): This is a small molecule that is involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including vasodilation, neurotransmission, and immune response. It is synthesized from the amino acid L-arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS).\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph that is a legitimate chemical compound is Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA)."},
