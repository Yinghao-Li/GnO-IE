Catalepsy: Catalepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by a loss of muscle tone and rigidity, leading to immobility or abnormal postures.\n2. Haloperidol: Haloperidol is a medication used to treat psychosis, including schizophrenia, and can cause catalepsy as a side effect.\n3. NOS (Nitric Oxide Synthase): NOS is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the production of nitric oxide, a molecule involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of blood flow and immune function.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Catalepsy\n* Haloperidol\n* NOS (Nitric Oxide Synthase)"},

It is likely a drug or a substance that is being used to treat haloperidol-induced catalepsy.\n2. haloperidol: This is a drug that is being used to induce catalepsy in the study. It is a typical antipsychotic drug that is used to treat psychotic disorders, but it can also cause extrapyramidal side effects such as catalepsy.\n3. NOS: This stands for nitric oxide synthase, which is an enzyme that is involved in the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the body. Nitric oxide is a signaling molecule that plays a role in many physiological processes, including the regulation of blood flow, immune function, and neurotransmission. In the context of the paragraph, NOS neurons are likely referring to neurons that produce nitric oxide.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. L-NOARG\n2. haloperidol\n3.
