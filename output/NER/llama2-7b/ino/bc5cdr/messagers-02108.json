Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Postprocedural creatinine level\n * PTRA group\n * PCI group\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Postprocedural creatinine level: creatinine\n * PTRA group: PTRA\n * PCI group: PCI\n3. Identify the verbs in each noun phrase:\n * Postprocedural creatinine level: decreased\n * PTRA group: decreased\n * PCI group: increased\n4. Identify the adjectives in each noun phrase:\n * Postprocedural creatinine level: nonsignificantly\n * PTRA group: nonsignificantly\n * PCI group: significantly\n5. Identify the entities in each noun phrase:\n * Postprocedural creatinine level: creatinine\n * PTRA group: PTRA\n * PCI group: PCI\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Creatinine\n* PTRA (Postprocedural Thrombotic Response to Angiotensin)\n* PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention)"},
