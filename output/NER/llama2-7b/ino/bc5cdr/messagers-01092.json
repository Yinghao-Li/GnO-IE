To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Fulminant hepatic failure\" is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is a severe and sudden form of liver failure that can lead to liver failure and even death.\n2. \"Hepatocellular damage\" is another disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It refers to damage to the liver cells, which can be caused by various factors such as viral infections, alcohol abuse, or drug toxicity.\n3. \"Baseline plasma bilirubin value\" is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment produced during the breakdown of red blood cells in the liver. An elevated baseline plasma bilirubin level can be a sign of liver dysfunction or disease.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Fulminant hepatic failure\n* Hepatocellular damage\n* Baseline plasma bilirubin value"},
