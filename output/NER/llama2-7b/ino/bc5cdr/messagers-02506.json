Depression: The paragraph mentions \"depressive-like behavior\" in mice, which suggests that the methamphetamine exposure may cause depressive symptoms.\n2. Neurotoxicity: The paragraph states that methamphetamine is neurotoxic, which means it can damage or poison the nervous system. This damage can lead to various neurological disorders, including depression.\n\nSo, the two disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Depression\n2. Neurotoxicity"},
