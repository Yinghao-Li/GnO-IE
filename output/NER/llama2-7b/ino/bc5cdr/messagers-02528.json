QRS prolongation\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Ventricular tachycardia: This is a type of arrhythmia, or abnormal heart rhythm, that occurs when the ventricles of the heart beat too quickly. It can be a sign of an underlying heart condition, such as coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy.\n2. Fibrillation: This is a type of arrhythmia that occurs when the heart's electrical impulses are disorganized and the heart muscle contracts in a rapid, irregular manner. It can be a sign of an underlying heart condition, such as coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy.\n3. QRS prolongation: This refers to a prolongation of the QRS complex on an electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a measure of the time it takes for the electrical impulses to travel through the heart. A prolonged QRS complex can be a sign of an underlying heart condition, such as a heart attack or cardiomyopathy."},
