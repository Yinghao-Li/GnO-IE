Cardiac component of baroreflex (CCB): This is a physiological process, not a disease, but it is mentioned in the context of measuring its sensitivity during different states of blood pressure.\n4. Phenylephrine (Phe): This is a medication or drug that is used to induce hypertension in the study.\n5.

Phenylephrine (Phe): This is a chemical substance that is used to induce hypertension in the body. It is a sympathomimetic amine that stimulates the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, leading to increased peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n2. Sodium nitroprusside (SN): This is another chemical substance used in the experiment to induce hypotension. It is a vasodilator that relaxes blood vessels and decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the production of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator.\n\nSo, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
