To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"galactose\" - This is a chemical substance, not a disease entity.\n2. \"cerebrospinal fluid\" - This is a bodily fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, and it is not a disease entity itself.\n3. \"administration\" - This is a term that refers to the way a drug or other substance is given to a patient, and it is not a disease entity.\n4. \"same galactose dose\" - This refers to the amount of galactose being given to the patient, and it is not a disease entity.\n5. \"lower\" - This is a comparison term that indicates a decrease in the concentration of galactose in the cerebrospinal fluid after oral administration compared to parenteral administration.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"galactose\" (the substance being administered)\n* \"cerebrospinal fluid\" (the bodily fluid being affected by the administration of galactose)\n\nI hope this helps!
