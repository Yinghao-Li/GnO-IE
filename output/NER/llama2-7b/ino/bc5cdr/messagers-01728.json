ADR nephropathy: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) caused by adverse drug reactions.\n2. Tubular atrophy: This is a histological change that occurs in the kidneys as a result of ADR nephropathy, where the tubules in the kidneys shrink or degenerate.\n3. Interstitial infiltration: This is another histological change that occurs in the kidneys as a result of ADR nephropathy, where inflammatory cells infiltrate the interstitial tissue of the kidneys.\n4. Fibrosis: This is a histological change that occurs in the kidneys as a result of ADR nephropathy, where scar tissue forms in the kidneys.\n\nSo, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
