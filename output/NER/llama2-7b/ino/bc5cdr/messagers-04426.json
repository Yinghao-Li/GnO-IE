Electrolytes: The ECG (electrocardiogram) is a measure of the electrical activity of the heart, which is influenced by electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.\n2. Cardiac muscle: The ECG is a reflection of the electrical activity of the cardiac muscle, which is made up of a variety of chemical components, including proteins, sugars, and lipids.\n3. Enzymes: Enzymes are biological molecules that facilitate chemical reactions in the body, including those involved in the production of the ECG.\n4. Hormones: Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate various physiological processes, including the heart's electrical activity, which can affect the ECG.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* Electrolytes\n* Cardiac muscle\n* Enzymes\n* Hormones"},
