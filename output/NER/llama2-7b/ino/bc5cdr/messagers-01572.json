To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs\" (NSAIDs) - This is a type of medication that is commonly associated with certain side effects, including the disease entity of acute interstitial nephritis.\n2. \"Acute interstitial nephritis\" - This is a type of kidney inflammation that occurs suddenly and can cause damage to the kidneys if left untreated.\n3. \"Granular tubular basement membrane deposits\" - This is a specific feature of the disease entity of acute interstitial nephritis, where deposits of a protein called immune complexes form in the basement membrane of the kidney's tubules.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Acute interstitial nephritis\n* Granular tubular basement membrane deposits"},

Granular tubular basement membrane deposits\n\nLet me explain each of these entities:\n\n1. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These are a class of drugs that are commonly used to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen.\n2. Acute interstitial nephritis: This is a type of kidney inflammation that occurs suddenly and can cause symptoms such as fever, flank pain, and decreased urine output.\n3. Granular tubular basement membrane deposits: These are abnormal deposits that can form in the kidneys and disrupt the normal functioning of the kidneys. They are made up of various substances, including proteins, lipids, and minerals.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
