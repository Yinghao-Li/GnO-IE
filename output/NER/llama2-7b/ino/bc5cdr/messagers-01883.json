Anticoagulation: This is a medical treatment that is used to prevent blood clots from forming or growing larger. Anticoagulants are chemical substances that interfere with the clotting process.\n2. Citrate: This is a chemical compound that is used in regional anticoagulation. Citrate is a weak acid that is used to prevent blood clots from forming in a specific region of the body.\n3. Toxicity: This is a chemical property of a substance that refers to its potential to cause harm or damage to living organisms. In the context of the paragraph, citrate toxicity refers to the potential for citrate to cause harm if it is used in the absence of a functional liver.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Anticoagulation\n2. Citrate\n3. Toxicity"},
