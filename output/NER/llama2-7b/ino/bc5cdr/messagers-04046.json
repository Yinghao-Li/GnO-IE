Doxorubicin: This is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer.\n2. Myocardial scintigraphy: This is a medical imaging technique that uses a small amount of a radioactive tracer (in this case, [omega-I-131] heptadecanoic acid, or I-131 HA) to visualize the heart muscle and detect any abnormalities.\n3. Heart failure: The paragraph mentions that the study was conducted to evaluate the effects of serial treatment with doxorubicin on global left ventricular function determined echocardiographically. This suggests that the dogs were being treated for heart failure.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
