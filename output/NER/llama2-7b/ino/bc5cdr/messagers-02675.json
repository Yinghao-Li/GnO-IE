Seizures: A neurological disorder characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, leading to symptoms such as convulsions, loss of consciousness, and muscle stiffness.\n2. Pediatric liver disease: A broad term encompassing various liver disorders that affect children, including inherited metabolic disorders, viral hepatitis, and liver cancer.\n3. End-stage liver disease: A condition where the liver function has significantly deteriorated, often resulting in liver failure.\n4. Child-Pugh score: A clinical score used to assess the severity of liver disease, based on factors such as serum bilirubin levels, INR, and presence of ascites.\n5. Trough TAC level: A measure of the level of the drug theophylline in the blood at its lowest point after a dose has been administered.\n\nNote that while \"serum total bilirubin after surgery\" is mentioned in the paragraph, it is not explicitly identified as a disease entity. However, it is a laboratory test that is often used to assess liver function."},
