Asthma: This is the disease that the high doses of inhaled salbutamol are being studied in. Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by inflammation, airway obstruction, and bronchospasm.\n2. Systemic beta-adrenoceptor responses: This is a broader category that includes all the different types of responses that occur in the body as a result of the inhaled salbutamol. Beta-adrenoceptors are receptors found on the surface of cells throughout the body that are activated by catecholamines, such as adrenaline. When salbutamol binds to these receptors, it can produce a variety of effects, including bronchodilation, increased heart rate, and increased blood pressure."},

Beta-adrenoceptors are activated by catecholamines, such as adrenaline, and play a role in the regulation of airway smooth muscle contraction and relaxation.\n3. Adrenaline: This is the common name for the hormone epinephrine, which is produced by the adrenal gland.
