Levodopa: Levodopa is a chemical compound that is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. It is an amino acid that is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps to replace the dopamine that is lost in Parkinson's disease.\n2. Dopamine: Dopamine is a chemical messenger that plays a crucial role in the brain's reward and pleasure centers, as well as in motor control. It is produced in the brain from the amino acid tyrosine and is involved in the transmission of signals between neurons.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Levodopa\n2. Dopamine"},
