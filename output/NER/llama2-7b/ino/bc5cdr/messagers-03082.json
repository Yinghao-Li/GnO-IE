Kindling: Kindling is a model of epilepsy that is characterized by progressive increases in seizure frequency and severity. It is often used to study the mechanisms of epileptogenesis and the effects of anticonvulsant drugs.\n2. Cognitive impairment: Cognitive impairment refers to a decline in cognitive function, including memory, attention, and other cognitive processes. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury, and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n3. Brain oxidative stress: Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Brain oxidative stress has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Kindling\n2. Cognitive impairment\n3. Brain oxidative stress"},
