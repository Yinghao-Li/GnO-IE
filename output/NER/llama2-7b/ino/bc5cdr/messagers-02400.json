PND71 - This is a disease or disorder, as it is a specific day (71) in the life of an organism, and the context of the paragraph suggests that it is a day of measurement or observation for some kind of medical or psychological assessment.\n2. Elevated plus maze (EPM) - This is a type of behavioral assay, which is a test or procedure used to measure or observe the behavior of an organism. It is not a disease entity itself, but rather a tool used to assess or diagnose a disease or disorder.\n3. Light/dark test - This is another type of behavioral assay, similar to the EPM, that is used to measure or observe the behavior of an organism in different environments. Like the EPM, it is not a disease entity itself, but rather a tool used to assess or diagnose a disease or disorder.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is PND71."},
