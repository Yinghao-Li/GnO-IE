Hemodynamic side effects can be caused by a variety of factors, including medication, disease, or injury.\n2. Agent: In this context, \"agent\" likely refers to the drug or substance being discussed, which is causing the hemodynamic side effects.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
