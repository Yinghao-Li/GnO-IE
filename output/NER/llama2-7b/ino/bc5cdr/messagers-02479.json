STZ (Streptozotocin): This is the disease-causing agent that is administered intracerebrally (icv) to the brain of the experimental animals. STZ is a toxic compound that can cause damage to the brain and nervous system, leading to cognitive deficits.\n2. Diabetes: The paragraph mentions that the animals were treated with oral galactose for one month after the STZ administration. This suggests that the animals may have been diabetic, as galactose is a sugar that can cause diabetes in animals.\n3. Cognitive deficits: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to the impairment in cognitive function caused by the STZ administration.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. STZ (Streptozotocin)\n2. Diabetes\n3. Cognitive deficits"},
