Pituitary response: This refers to the way the pituitary gland responds to a stimulus, in this case, haloperidol.\n2. Luteinizing hormone (LH): This is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates the production of sex hormones in the ovaries (in females) or testes (in males).\n3. Prolactin: This is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates milk production in lactating women.\n4. Hyperprolactinemia: This is a condition in which there is an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hyperprolactinemia (an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood)\n* Luteinizing hormone (LH)\n* Prolactin"},
