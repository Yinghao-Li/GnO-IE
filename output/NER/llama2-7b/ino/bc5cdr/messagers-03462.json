Identify the keywords:\n * \"disease\"\n * \"disorder\"\n * \"illness\"\n2. Look for words that are associated with disease:\n * \"prodrug\"\n * \"physicochemical properties\"\n3. Check if any of the words are related to medical conditions:\n * \"3-hydroxymethyl-5,5-diphenylhydantoin\" (the active ingredient in the paragraph)\n * \"phenytoin\" (the drug that the prodrug is converted into)\n\nBased on these steps, we can identify the following disease entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. Phenytoin: This is the drug that the prodrug is converted into, and it is used to treat seizures and other neurological disorders.\n2. 3-hydroxymethyl-5,5-diphenylhydantoin: This is the active ingredient in the paragraph, which is a prodrug of phenytoin.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are phenytoin and 3-hydroxymethyl-5,5-diphenylhydantoin."},
