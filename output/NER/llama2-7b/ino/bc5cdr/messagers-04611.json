Ventricular tachyarrhythmia: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, referring to a type of abnormal heart rhythm.\n2. Induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmia: This is a disease entity mentioned in the context of the study, referring to the ability of oral medication (d, l-sotalol) to prevent or induce ventricular tachyarrhythmia in patients.\n3. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible: This is a disease entity mentioned in the context of the study, referring to the ability of oral medication (d, l-sotalol) to prevent or induce ventricular tachyarrhythmia in patients, with some patients showing that the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible despite treatment.\n4. Two patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d, l-sotalol once daily: This is a disease entity mentioned in the context of the study, referring to two patients who were unable to tolerate the recommended dose of oral medication (d, l-sotalol) once daily.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
