Dexmedetomidine: This is a sedative and anesthetic drug that is used in neurocritical care. It is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, which means it binds to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the brain and spinal cord, leading to sedation and anxiolysis.\n2. Propofol: This is another sedative and anesthetic drug that is commonly used in neurocritical care. It is a intravenous anesthetic agent that works by potentiating the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, leading to sedation and anxiolysis.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are dexmedetomidine and propofol."},
