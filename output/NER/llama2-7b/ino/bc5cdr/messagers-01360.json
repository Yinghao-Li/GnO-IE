Malaria is a serious and sometimes life-threatening infection caused by a parasite that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito.\n2. Jaundice: Jaundice is a condition in which the skin and eyes turn yellow due to an excess of bilirubin in the blood. It can be a symptom of various underlying diseases, including liver disease, pancreatitis, and malaria.\n3. Arrhythmia: Arrhythmia refers to abnormal heart rhythms or irregular heartbeats. In this case, the patient experienced premature ventricular contractions, which are abnormal heartbeats that occur too soon after the previous heartbeat.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Malaria\n2. Jaundice\n3. Arrhythmia"},
