Cardiac marker enzyme: This is a type of protein that is produced in the body in response to damage or stress to the heart muscle. The level of these enzymes in the blood can be used to diagnose and monitor heart conditions such as myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n2. Left ventricular remodeling: This refers to the changes that occur in the left ventricle of the heart in response to injury or disease. These changes can include hypertrophy (enlargement) of the heart muscle, fibrosis (scarring), and loss of function.\n\nSo, the paragraph suggests that betaine, when administered orally at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg, can reduce the level of cardiac marker enzyme in the serum and prevent left ventricular remodeling."},
