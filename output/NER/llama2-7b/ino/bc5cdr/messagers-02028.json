However, based on the context, we can identify two potential disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Osteoporosis: The expression of OAT1 and OAT3 was also decreased. OAT1 and OAT3 are genes that play a role in the transport of calcium ions in the body, and their dysfunction has been implicated in osteoporosis, a disease characterized by bone fragility and loss.\n2. Kidney disease: OAT3 is also involved in the transport of drugs and toxins from the kidneys to the urine. Therefore, a decrease in the expression of OAT3 could potentially lead to kidney disease, as the body may have difficulty removing harmful substances from the blood.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are osteoporosis and kidney disease."},
