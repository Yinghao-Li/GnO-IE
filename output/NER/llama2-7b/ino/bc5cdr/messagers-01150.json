Peliosis: This is a rare condition where small blood vessels in the liver become widened and filled with fluid, leading to liver damage.\n3. Fanconi's anemia: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and other organs. It is characterized by a deficiency of certain enzymes that are important for DNA repair, leading to an increased risk of cancer and other health problems.\n\nSo, the paragraph suggests that non-metastasizing hepatic neoplasms and peliosis can develop in patients who are being treated with androgens and corticosteroids for Fanconi's anemia."},

Corticosteroids include hormones such as cortisol, aldosterone, and prednisone.\n3.
