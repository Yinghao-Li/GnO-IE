Dipyridamole: This is a medication that is used to induce myocardial ischemia in order to diagnose coronary artery disease.\n3. Coronary artery disease: This is a condition where the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) become narrowed or blocked, leading to a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
