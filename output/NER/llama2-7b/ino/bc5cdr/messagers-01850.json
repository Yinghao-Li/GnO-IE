In this paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Disease\":\n\n1. 6-hydroxydopamine lesion: This is a type of brain damage caused by the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, which can lead to degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.\n2. Dyskinesias: Dyskinesias are abnormal movements that can occur as a result of brain damage or disease, particularly in the basal ganglia. They can include involuntary movements, tremors, and other types of movement disorders.\n\nSo, in summary, the paragraph is discussing the effects of lacking CB1 cannabinoid receptors on the vulnerability of mice to 6-hydroxydopamine lesions and the development of dyskinesias."},
