    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Neuroradiologic investigations\" - This term refers to a type of medical investigation that involves the use of imaging techniques to diagnose and study neurological disorders.\n2. \"including magnetic resonance imaging scans\" - This phrase refers to a specific type of imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain and other internal structures.\n3. \"in both patients\" - This phrase indicates that the investigation was performed on two or more individuals.\n4. \"showed no evidence of intracranial abnormality\" - This sentence means that the imaging tests did not reveal any abnormalities or abnormal structures within the skull.\n\nSo, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the \"Disease\" entities that can be identified are:\n\n1. Neuroradiologic investigations\n2. Magnetic resonance imaging scans\n3. Intracranial abnormality"},
