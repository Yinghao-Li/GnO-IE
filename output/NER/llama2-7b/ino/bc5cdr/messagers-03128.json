Methimazole-associated hepatocellular necrosis\n3. Propylthiouracil-associated lupus-like syndrome\n\nLet me explain each of these entities:\n\n1. Propylthiouracil-associated acute hepatitis: This refers to a type of liver inflammation caused by the use of propylthiouracil, a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism.\n2. Methimazole-associated hepatocellular necrosis: This refers to a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of methimazole, a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism. Hepatocellular necrosis is a condition where the cells of the liver die, leading to liver failure.\n3. Propylthiouracil-associated lupus-like syndrome: This refers to a rare but potentially serious side effect of propylthiouracil, which can cause a condition resembling systemic lupus erythematosus, a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs in the body.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
