Galactose: Galactose is a type of sugar that is present in milk and other dairy products. In this paragraph, the administration of oral galactose led to the appearance of galactose in the blood, indicating that the body is unable to properly metabolize this sugar.\n2. Galactosemia: Galactosemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize galactose. It is caused by mutations in the GALT gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in galactose metabolism. If left untreated, galactosemia can lead to a range of serious health problems, including liver disease, growth delays, and developmental delays.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are galactose and galactosemia."},
