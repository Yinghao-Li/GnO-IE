To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Peak CE levels\" refers to the peak levels of a certain enzyme (CE) in the body, which is associated with a particular disease or condition.\n2. \"Cardiac output\" refers to the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute, which can be affected by various cardiovascular diseases.\n3. \"dP / dt (max)\" refers to the maximum rate of change of pressure in the pulmonary artery, which can be an indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a serious disease that can lead to heart failure and death.\n4. \"SVO (2)\" refers to the stroke volume, which is the volume of blood pumped by the heart with each beat, and the subscript \"2\" indicates that this is the second time this variable is mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cardiac output (associated with various cardiovascular diseases)\n* Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)\n\nI hope this helps!
