DHEA (Disease): This is the substance being studied in the experiment, and it is being shown to have an effect on the behavior of the animals.\n2. Locomotor activity (Disease): The paragraph mentions that DHEA reduced locomotor activity in the animals. Locomotor activity refers to the ability to move around freely, and a reduction in this ability could be indicative of a neurological or motor disorder.\n3. Catalepsy (Disease): The paragraph also mentions that DHEA increased catalepsy in the animals. Catalepsy is a condition characterized by a loss of muscle tone and rigidity, and it can be caused by a variety of factors, including neurological disorders.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are DHEA, locomotor activity, and catalepsy."},
