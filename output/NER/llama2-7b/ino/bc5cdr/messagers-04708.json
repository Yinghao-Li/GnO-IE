Manic depression: This is a mental health disorder that is also known as bipolar disorder. It is characterized by periods of mania or hypomania, often alternating with episodes of depression.\n2. Lithium: This is a medication that is commonly used to treat manic depression. It is a mood stabilizer that helps to level out mood swings and prevent episodes of mania or depression.\n3. Hyperosmolar coma: This is a serious complication that can occur in people with diabetes, particularly those who are not properly managing their condition. It is caused by a high level of glucose in the blood, which can lead to brain swelling and coma.\n4. Nonketotic coma: This is a type of coma that occurs in people with diabetes when their blood sugar levels are very high and they are not able to produce or respond to insulin. It is different from ketotic coma, which occurs when the body produces ketones (acids) in the absence of insulin.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
