Cancer: The patients in the study are chemotherapy-naive, meaning they have not received chemotherapy before. This suggests that they have cancer.\n2. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: The paragraph mentions that the patients are receiving high-dose cisplatin, which is a chemotherapy drug that can cause nausea and vomiting. The study is investigating the effectiveness of granisetron in preventing these side effects.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cancer\n2. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting"},
