To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Children\" - This is a patient population, which is a disease entity.\n2. \"persistent sterile leukocyturia\" - This is a symptom, which is not a disease entity itself but rather a sign or manifestation of a disease.\n3. \"serum creatinine levels\" - This is a laboratory test result, which can be abnormal in various diseases.\n4. \"50 % above normal\" - This is a quantitative measure of the degree of abnormality in the serum creatinine levels, which can be used to identify the disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Persistent sterile leukocyturia (a symptom)\n2. Abnormal serum creatinine levels (a laboratory test result)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
