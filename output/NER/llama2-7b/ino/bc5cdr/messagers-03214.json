Serum disease: The paragraph mentions \"Classical and emergent serum\" markers, which suggests that the study is focused on diseases that affect the blood or serum.\n2. Urinary disease: The paragraph also mentions \"urinary\" tissue markers, which suggests that the study is also focused on diseases that affect the urinary system.\n3. Kidney disease: The paragraph mentions \"kidney tissue\" markers, which suggests that the study is also focused on diseases that affect the kidneys.\n\nSo, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Serum disease\n2. Urinary disease\n3. Kidney disease"},
