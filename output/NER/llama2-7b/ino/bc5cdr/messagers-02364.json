To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"CYP\" - This could stand for \"cytosolic protein,\" but it could also refer to a specific disease entity, such as \"cytotoxic urothelial carcinoma.\"\n2. \"cystitis\" - This is a disease entity that refers to inflammation of the bladder.\n3. \"induced\" - This word suggests that the disease entity being referred to is caused by something else, rather than being inherent to the bladder.\n4. \"P2X3\" and \"NK1\" - These are disease entities that refer to specific receptors found on the surface of cells in the bladder.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cystitis\n* Induced cystitis\n* P2X3 receptor\n* NK1 receptor"},
