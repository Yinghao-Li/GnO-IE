Coronary artery disease (CAD): This is the disease that the patients are being treated for.\n2. Myocardial infarction (heart attack): This is a type of CAD that occurs when the blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked, causing damage to the heart tissue.\n3. Cardiac marker: These are substances produced by the body in response to injury or inflammation in the cardiovascular system. The markers are measured in the blood to help diagnose and monitor cardiovascular conditions such as myocardial infarction.\n\nSo, the paragraph is comparing the outcomes of two groups of patients who received different treatments: those who received immediate coronary CTA in the emergency department (ED) without serial marker measurements, and those who underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial marker measurements."},
