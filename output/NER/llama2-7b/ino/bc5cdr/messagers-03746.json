ST depression: This is a medical condition where the ST segment on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is flattened or depressed, indicating abnormal electrical activity in the heart muscle.\n2. MI (Myocardial Infarction): This is a medical condition where there is damage to the heart muscle due to a lack of blood supply, often caused by a blockage in the coronary arteries.\n3. ANT (Anti-Myocardial Infarction): This is a medical condition where there is no evidence of myocardial infarction (heart attack) on an electrocardiogram (ECG).\n4. INF (Infection): This is a medical condition where there is an abnormality or infection in the body, which can affect various organs and systems.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.

MI (Myocardial Infarction) - MI refers to Myocardial Infarction, which is a type of heart attack caused by a blockage in a coronary artery that reduces blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to damage or death of the heart tissue.\n3. ANT (Anti-cardiac) - ANT is an abbreviation for Anti-cardiac, which refers to a medication or agent that is used to treat or prevent cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac problems.\n4.
