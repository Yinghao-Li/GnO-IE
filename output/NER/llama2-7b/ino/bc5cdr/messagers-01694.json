To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Two cases had a fatal outcome\":\n * Fatal outcome can be associated with various diseases, such as:\n  + Cardiovascular disease\n  + Cancer\n  + Trauma\n  + Sepsis\n  + Other severe illnesses\n2. \"One resulted in severe sequelae\":\n * Severe sequelae can be a result of various diseases, such as:\n  + Traumatic brain injury\n  + Spinal cord injury\n  + Burns\n  + Amputations\n  + Other severe injuries\n\nSo, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the possible disease entities are:\n\n* Cardiovascular disease\n* Cancer\n* Trauma\n* Sepsis\n* Traumatic brain injury\n* Spinal cord injury\n* Burns\n* Amputations\n\nIt's important to note that these are just possibilities, and without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint the specific disease entity(ies) involved."},

Case (container or vessel)\n2. Fatal outcome (end result of a chemical reaction)\n3. Sequelae (secondary effects or consequences of a chemical reaction)"},
