Let's break down the paragraph and identify the disease entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"Renal damage\" - This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It refers to damage to the kidneys.\n2. \"Albuminuria\" - This is a specific type of renal damage that refers to the presence of albumin in the urine.\n3. \"Very low serum albumin levels\" - This is another specific finding that is associated with renal damage and albuminuria. Low levels of serum albumin in the blood can indicate that the kidneys are not functioning properly.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Renal damage\n2. Albuminuria\n3. Low serum albumin levels."},
