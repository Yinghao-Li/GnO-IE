Lesioned group: This refers to the group of individuals who have a lesion or damage to a specific area of the brain. In this context, the lesioned group is compared to the sham group to determine the effect of the lesion on blood flow.\n2. Lesion: This is the specific area of the brain where the damage or lesion occurred.\n3. Brain damage: This refers to the damage or injury to the brain tissue, which can result in various cognitive, emotional, and physical symptoms.\n4. Cerebral vasospasm: This is a condition where the blood vessels in the brain constrict or narrow, which can reduce blood flow to the brain.\n5. Hypertension: This is a condition where the blood pressure is elevated, which can put extra strain on the blood vessels in the brain and lead to cerebral vasospasm.\n\nSo, the entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n* Lesioned group\n* Lesion\n* Brain damage\n* Cerebral vasospasm\n* Hypertension"},
