OS: One-year overall survival is a measure of the percentage of patients who are alive after one year following their cancer diagnosis.

Median OS: Median overall survival is the midpoint of the survival distribution, which represents the length of time after diagnosis that 50% of patients are expected to survive. It is also a chemical entity as it is a measure of the survival rate of cancer patients.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. OS (One-year overall survival)\n2.
