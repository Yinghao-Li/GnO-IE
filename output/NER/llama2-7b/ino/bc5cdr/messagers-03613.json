Cardiovascular disease: This is the broad category of diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels.\n2. Cardiovascular disease includes:\n * Hypertension (high blood pressure)\n * Atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)\n * Heart failure\n * Myocardial infarction (heart attack)\n * Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms)\n3. Calcium channel blocking agents: These are a type of medication used to treat cardiovascular disease by blocking the flow of calcium into the heart muscle cells, which can help to relax the heart and reduce blood pressure.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cardiovascular disease\n2. Hypertension\n3. Atherosclerosis\n4. Heart failure\n5. Myocardial infarction\n6. Arrhythmias\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
