Status epilepticus: This is a type of seizure disorder characterized by continuous or recurrent seizures that last for more than 30 minutes.\n2. Brain damage: This refers to any type of damage or injury to the brain, which can result from various causes such as trauma, infection, or disease.\n3. Lithium: This is a medication that is commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, but it can also have neuroprotective effects and is used in some research studies to model epilepsy.\n4. Pilocarpine: This is a medication that is used to treat glaucoma, but it can also cause seizures and is sometimes used in research studies to model epilepsy.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Status epilepticus\n* Brain damage\n\nThe other terms mentioned in the paragraph (e.g. \"NMDA receptors\", \"activation\") are not disease entities, but rather biological processes or mechanisms that are involved in the development or progression of these diseases."},
