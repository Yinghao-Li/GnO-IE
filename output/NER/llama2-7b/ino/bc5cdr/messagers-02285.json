Chronic instrumentation: This is not a disease entity, but rather a method of studying the effects of drugs on the body.\n2. Conscious dogs: This is not a disease entity, but rather a description of the animals used in the study.\n3. Large (circumflex artery) and small coronary arteries: These are not disease entities, but rather specific types of blood vessels that are affected by the drugs being studied.\n4. Systemic hemodynamics: This is not a disease entity, but rather a term that refers to the overall circulatory system and its functions.\n5. Nitroglycerin: This is a disease entity, as it is a medication used to treat angina pectoris, a condition characterized by chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.\n\nSo, out of the entities mentioned in the paragraph, only \"nitroglycerin\" can be considered a disease entity."},
