Baseline values: This term refers to the normal or typical values of a particular measure or characteristic, such as blood pressure or blood sugar levels, before any treatment or intervention. In this context, \"baseline values\" could be considered a disease entity, as it represents a measure of a patient's health status before any treatment.\n2. Treatment: The term \"treatment\" could be considered a disease entity, as it refers to any intervention or action taken to address or manage a disease or condition. In this paragraph, the treatment being referred to is the one that had no significant effect on the baseline values.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
