Arrhythmia refers to abnormal heart rhythms, which can be caused by various factors such as coronary artery disease, heart valve problems, or electrolyte imbalances.\n2. Heart block: The term \"alternation of long and short P-P intervals\" suggests the presence of heart block, which is a type of arrhythmia characterized by a delay or blockage in the electrical signals that control the heart's rhythm.\n3. Pauses: The paragraph mentions \"occasional pauses,\" which could indicate a condition known as pause arrhythmia, where the heart stops beating for a short period of time.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Arrhythmia, Heart Block, and Pause Arrhythmia."},
