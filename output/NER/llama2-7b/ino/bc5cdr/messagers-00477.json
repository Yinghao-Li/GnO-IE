Nephrotoxicity: This refers to damage to the kidneys, which can occur as a side effect of taking indinavir.\n2. Leukocyturia: This is a condition where there is an abnormal amount of white blood cells in the urine.\n3. Sterile leukocyturia: This is a type of leukocyturia where there are no bacteria or other microorganisms present in the urine, indicating that the white blood cells are coming from the kidneys or the urinary tract.\n4. Kidney disease: This refers to any condition that affects the kidneys, including nephrotoxicity.\n5. Pediatric disease: This refers to diseases that affect children, including nephrotoxicity in children.\n6. Age-related disease: This refers to diseases that occur as a result of aging, such as age-related nephrotoxicity.\n7. C (max): This is a term used to describe the maximum concentration of a drug in the bloodstream, which can be used to monitor the effectiveness and safety of the drug.\n\nI hope this helps!
