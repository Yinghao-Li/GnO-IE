OCs: Oral Contraceptives are a type of hormonal contraceptive that contains estrogen and progesterone. They are used to prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation, thickening the cervical mucus, and thinning the lining of the uterus.\n2. third-generation OCs: Third-generation OCs are a specific type of oral contraceptive that is the third generation of hormonal contraceptives. They are designed to have a more consistent hormone release pattern than earlier generations, which can improve their effectiveness and reduce side effects.\n3. second-generation OCs: Second-generation OCs are a specific type of oral contraceptive that is the second generation of hormonal contraceptives. They were introduced in the 1970s and 1980s and were designed to have a more consistent hormone release pattern than earlier generations.\n\nIn summary, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are OCs (Oral Contraceptives), third-generation OCs, and second-generation OCs, which are all types of hormonal contraceptives."},
