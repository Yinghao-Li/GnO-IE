Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n\n* Interstrain variation\n* acute toxic response\n* caffeine\n* mice\n\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n\n* Interstrain variation: variation\n* acute toxic response: response\n* caffeine: caffeine\n* mice: mice\n\n3. Identify the entities that refer to diseases or medical conditions:\n\n* acute toxic response: This refers to a medical condition or disease caused by exposure to a toxic substance, such as caffeine.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* acute toxic response\n\nI hope this helps!
