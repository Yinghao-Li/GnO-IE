Methotrexate contamination: Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug that can cause toxicity when it accumulates in the body.\n2. Folate deficiency: Folate is a nutrient that is important for cell growth and development. A deficiency in folate can lead to a range of health problems, including anemia, fatigue, and neurological disorders.\n3. Cranial irradiation: Cranial irradiation is a medical treatment that involves exposing the head to radiation to treat cancer or other conditions.\n4. Intrathecal methotrexate toxicity: Intrathecal methotrexate toxicity refers to the harmful effects of methotrexate when it accumulates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n\nI hope this helps!
