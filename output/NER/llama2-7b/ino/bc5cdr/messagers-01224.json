Let's go through the entities mentioned in the paragraph one by one:\n\n1. \"TaqIB\" - This is a genetic marker or a locus, which is a specific location on a chromosome where a particular gene or genetic variation is found.\n2. \"rs6275\" - This is a genetic marker or a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which is a specific point in the genome where there is a variation in the DNA sequence between individuals.\n3. \"TaqIA\" - This is another genetic marker or locus, which is also a specific location on a chromosome where a particular gene or genetic variation is found.\n4. \"allele distribution\" - This refers to the frequency or distribution of different forms of a gene (called alleles) in a population.\n5. \"haplotypes\" - This refers to the combination of genetic markers or loci that are inherited together on the same chromosome. In other words, haplotypes are groups of genetic markers that are linked together on a chromosome.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* TaqIB\n* rs6275\n* TaqIA\n\nThese are all genetic markers or loci that are used to identify specific genetic variations in a population."},
