In this context, OR represents the odds ratio for the relationship between tranexamic acid and seizures.\n3. 95% CI: The term \"95% CI\" stands for \"95% Confidence Interval\" and represents the range of values within which the true value of a statistical estimate is likely to fall with a certain degree of confidence. In this context, the 95% CI represents the range of values within which the odds ratio for the relationship between tranexamic acid and seizures is likely to fall with 95% confidence.\n4. p-value: The term \"p-value\" represents the probability of observing a result as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, assuming that the true effect of the variable being studied is zero. In this context, the p-value represents the probability of observing an odds ratio as extreme as the one observed (14.3) for the relationship between tranexamic acid and seizures, assuming that there is no real effect."},
