Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a type of cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, that can occur when the normal electrical impulses in the heart are disrupted.\n2. Bradyarrhythmia refers to a slow heart rate, which can be caused by various factors such as heart disease, medication side effects, or other medical conditions. In this context, the study is focused on determining whether the use of amiodarone in patients with AF increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker."},
