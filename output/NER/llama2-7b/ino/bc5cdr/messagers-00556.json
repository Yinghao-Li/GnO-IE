Mast cells: The paragraph mentions that there were statistically increased numbers of mast cells in the mucosa of the groups treated with indomethacin compared to the control group. Mast cells are a type of immune cell that play a role in allergic reactions and inflammation.\n2. Lanthanum nitrate: The paragraph also mentions that lanthanum nitrate penetrated through the intercellular areas of the epithelium in the groups treated with indomethacin. Lanthanum nitrate is a drug used to treat conditions such as hyperphosphatemia (elevated phosphate levels in the blood) and kidney disease.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are mast cells and lanthanum nitrate."},
