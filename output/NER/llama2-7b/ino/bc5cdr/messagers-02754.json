Anaesthesia: Ketamine and propofol are both anesthetics used to induce unconsciousness and alleviate pain during medical procedures.\n2. Propofol: Propofol is a medication used to induce and maintain anesthesia, particularly for surgical procedures. It is also used to sedate patients for medical procedures or to help manage pain.\n3. Medialipid: Medialipid is a medication used to administer propofol for anesthesia.\n4. Saline: Saline is a sterile solution used to flush or irrigate wounds, as well as to administer medications or fluids intravenously.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Anaesthesia (induced by ketamine and propofol)\n* Propofol (a medication used for anesthesia)\n* Medialipid (a medication used to administer propofol)\n* Saline (a sterile solution used for medical procedures)"},
