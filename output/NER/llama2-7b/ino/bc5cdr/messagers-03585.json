Neurological disorder: The paragraph mentions the increase in norepinephrine levels, which is a neurotransmitter involved in various neurological processes, including mood regulation and attention. An imbalance in norepinephrine levels has been linked to several neurological disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n2. Endocrine disorder: Epinephrine is another neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the body's \"fight or flight\" response, which is regulated by the adrenal glands. An imbalance in epinephrine levels can lead to various endocrine disorders, such as hyperthyroidism or hypopituitarism.\n\nTherefore, the two potential disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are neurological disorder and endocrine disorder."},
