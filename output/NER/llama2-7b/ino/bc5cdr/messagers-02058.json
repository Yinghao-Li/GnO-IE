Identify the entities in the sentence:\n\nSentence: CCL2 expression in the hippocampus was examined by molecular assay.\n\nEntities:\n\n* CCL2 (Disease)\n* hippocampus (Organ)\n* molecular assay (Procedure)\n2. Identify the relationships between the entities:\n\nRelationships:\n\n* CCL2 is expressed in the hippocampus (relationship: location)\n* The expression of CCL2 was examined using a molecular assay (relationship: examination)\n3. Identify the main topic of the paragraph:\n\nMain topic: The expression of CCL2 in the hippocampus\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* CCL2 (Disease)\n\nThe other entities in the paragraph (hippocampus and molecular assay) are not disease entities, but rather organs and procedures, respectively."},
