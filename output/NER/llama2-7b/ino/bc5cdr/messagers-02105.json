Nephrotoxicity: This refers to the damage caused to the kidneys as a result of exposure to certain drugs or toxins.\n2. Nephritis: This is a type of inflammation of the kidneys, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, autoimmune disorders, or drug toxicity.\n3. Renal failure: This refers to the loss of kidney function, which can be acute or chronic.\n4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): This is a gradual loss of kidney function over time, usually caused by diabetes, high blood pressure, or other underlying conditions.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
