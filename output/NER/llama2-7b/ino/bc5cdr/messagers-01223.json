Identify the keywords:\n * Polymorphisms\n * TaqID\n * Ser311Cys\n * rs6277\n2. Determine the context:\n * The paragraph is discussing the results of a study\n * The study recruited a population\n * The study found that certain genetic markers (TaqID, Ser311Cys, and rs6277) were not polymorphic in the population\n3. Identify the entities:\n * Polymorphisms: These are genetic variations that occur when there are multiple forms of a gene.\n * TaqID: This is a specific type of polymorphism that refers to a specific genetic variation in the TAQ polymorphism.\n * Ser311Cys: This is another specific type of polymorphism that refers to a specific genetic variation in the SERPINB2 gene.\n * rs6277: This is a specific genetic variation in the MTHFR gene.\n4. Classify the entities:\n * Polymorphisms: These are genetic variations that occur in the population and can affect the function of genes.\n * TaqID: This is a specific type of polymorphism that refers to a specific genetic variation in the TAQ polymorphism.\n * Ser311Cys: This is another specific type of polymorphism that refers to a specific genetic variation in the SERPINB2 gene.\n * rs6277: This is a specific genetic variation in the MTHFR gene.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Polymorphisms\n* TaqID\n* Ser311Cys\n* rs6277\n\nThese entities are related to genetic variations that can affect the function of genes and may be associated with certain diseases or conditions."},
