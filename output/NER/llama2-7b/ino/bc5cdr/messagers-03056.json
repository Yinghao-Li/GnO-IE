Teratogenicity: This is a term that refers to the ability of a substance to cause birth defects or abnormalities in the developing fetus.\n4. Growth retardation: This is a term that refers to the slowing down or inhibition of growth and development, which can be caused by exposure to certain chemical substances.\n\nTherefore, the three chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
