Intravenous fluorescein (a medication)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Adverse reaction: This is a broad term that refers to any unfavorable or abnormal response to a drug, medication, or other substance. In this context, the adverse reaction is the recurrence of the reaction after re-exposure to intravenous fluorescein.\n2. Intravenous fluorescein: This is a specific medication that is used to diagnose and treat certain medical conditions, such as inflammatory diseases and certain types of cancer. In this paragraph, the author is referring to the medication as the cause of the adverse reaction."},
