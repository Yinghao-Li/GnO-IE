To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"However\" - This word indicates a contrast or a change in topic, suggesting that the previous sentence mentioned something related to disease.\n2. \"in the tubular basement membrane (TBM)\" - This phrase refers to a specific structure in the body, which is a type of membrane that lines the blood vessels.\n3. \"very intense granular deposits of polyclonal IgG and C3\" - This sentence describes the presence of certain proteins (IgG and C3) in the TBM, which is abnormal and could indicate a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Tubular basement membrane disease (TBM disease)\n2. Polyclonal IgG disease\n3. C3 disease\n\nNote that these are just possibilities based on the information provided in the paragraph, and more context or additional information may be needed to confirm the specific disease entities involved."},
