Morphine: Morphine is a chemical compound that is used as an analgesic. It is a semi-synthetic opioid that works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, producing analgesia.\n2. Sulfate: Morphine sulfate is the chemical compound formed by combining morphine with sulfuric acid. It is used as a solubilizer and stabilizer in pharmaceutical formulations.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Morphine\n2. Sulfate"},
