OCs (Oral Contraceptives) - Oral contraceptives are a type of hormonal birth control pill that contains estrogen and progesterone. They are commonly referred to as \"the pill.\"\n2. second-generation products - Second-generation oral contraceptives are a category of oral contraceptives that contain lower doses of estrogen and progesterone than earlier generations. These products were developed to reduce the risk of certain side effects associated with earlier generations of oral contraceptives, such as higher doses of estrogen and progesterone.\n3. third-generation products - Third-generation oral contraceptives are a category of oral contraceptives that contain even lower doses of estrogen and progesterone than second-generation products. These products are designed to provide effective contraception while minimizing the risk of side effects.\n\nIn the paragraph, the author is suggesting that the observed increase in odds ratio associated with third-generation oral contraceptives may be due to residual confounding by age, rather than a real effect of the drugs themselves. Therefore, the term \"Chemical\" is used to refer to the oral contraceptives, which are the active ingredients in these drugs."},
