VCUG - VCUG stands for Voiding Cystourethrogram, which is a diagnostic test used to evaluate the bladder and urinary tract. It is a chemical test that involves the use of a contrast agent to visualize the bladder and urinary tract.\n2. Recovery period - The recovery period refers to the time after the VCUG test during which the patient's level of consciousness and vital signs return to normal levels. This is a chemical process involving the metabolism and elimination of the contrast agent used during the VCUG test.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
