Exercise\nb. ejection fraction\nc. dobutamine\n\n2. Identify the verbs in the paragraph:\n\na. reduced\nb. was\nc. compared\nd. p\n\n3. Identify the adjectives in the paragraph:\n\na. mean\nb. SEM\nc. p\n\n4. Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n\na. baseline\nb. minutes\nc. dobutamine\n\n5. Based on the above analysis, we can identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph as:\n\na. Ejection fraction (a measure of the heart's pumping function)\nb. Dobutamine (a medication used to stimulate the heart)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are ejection fraction and dobutamine."},

SEM: This stands for Standard Error of the Mean, which is a statistical measure that is used to express the variability of a measurement. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the error range associated with each measurement of ejection fraction.\n4. p-value: This is a statistical measure that is used to determine the significance of a particular measurement or comparison. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the p-value associated with each comparison of ejection fraction at different time points after exercise or dobutamine administration.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
