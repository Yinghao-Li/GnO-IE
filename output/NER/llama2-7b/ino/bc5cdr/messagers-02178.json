Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Seven patients\n * activity restrictions\n * tracheotomy\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Seven patients (disease)\n * activity restrictions (disease)\n * tracheotomy (disease)\n3. Determine if each noun is a disease entity:\n * Seven patients (yes, a disease entity)\n * activity restrictions (no, not a disease entity)\n * tracheotomy (yes, a disease entity)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Disease: Seven patients\n* Disease: Tracheotomy\n\nI hope this helps!
