Intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)\n3. Death (a condition or state of being)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Hypertension: Hypertension is a disease characterized by abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries. In the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned that PPA overdose can cause severe hypertension.\n2. Intracerebral hemorrhage: Intracerebral hemorrhage is a type of stroke that occurs when there is bleeding in the brain. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that PPA overdose can cause intracerebral hemorrhage, which can lead to severe brain damage or death.\n3. Death: Death is a condition or state of being that occurs when an organism stops functioning or ceases to exist. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that PPA overdose can cause death, which is a severe and irreversible outcome of the overdose.\n\nTherefore, the three disease entities identified in the paragraph are hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, and death."},
