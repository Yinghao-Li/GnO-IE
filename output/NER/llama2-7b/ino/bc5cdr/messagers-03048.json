    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the following \"Disease\" entities can be identified:\n\n1. QT interval disorder: This is the disease entity that is being studied in the paragraph. QT interval is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. Abnormalities in the QT interval can lead to irregular heart rhythms and can be a sign of certain heart conditions.\n2. HiPS: HiPS stands for human induced pluripotent stem cells. These are stem cells that are derived from adult cells, such as skin or blood cells, and are reprogrammed to have the ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body. HiPS cells are often used in drug development and toxicity testing.\n3. CMs: CMs stands for cardiomyocytes, which are cells that make up the heart muscle.\n4. FPDc: FPDc stands for functional precision drug discovery, which is a method of drug development that involves using high-throughput screening and computational models to identify potential drug candidates and predict their efficacy and safety.\n\nSo, the disease entity being studied in the paragraph is QT interval disorder, and the other entities mentioned are related to the methods and tools used in the study."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Chemical\" entities:\n\n1. Drug candidates: These are the chemical substances being tested for their effects on the QT interval.\n2. MEA system: MEA stands for \"Membrane Electrode Assembly,\" which is a device used to measure the electrical activity of cells or tissues. In this context, the MEA system is likely a device used to measure the effects of drug candidates on cardiac cells or tissues.\n3. FPDc: FPDc stands for \"Fluorescence Polarization Detection system using Cardiac Myocytes.\" This is a system used to measure the effects of drug candidates on cardiac cells or tissues using fluorescence polarization.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Drug candidates\n2. MEA system\n3. FPDc"},
