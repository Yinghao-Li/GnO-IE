Nerve: The paragraph mentions \"each nerve\" and \"nerve,\" which suggests that the entity being referred to is a type of disease or condition that affects the nerve.\n2. Baseline: The term \"baseline\" is used to describe the initial or normal level of something, which implies that there is a deviation from this level due to some disease or condition.\n3. SNAP index: The term \"SNAP index\" is a measure of the severity of a disease or condition, as it is calculated by taking the mean of the four SNAP amplitudes.\n\nTherefore, the entities identified as \"Disease\" in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
