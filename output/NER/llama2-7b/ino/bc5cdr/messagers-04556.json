Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n\nHBV DNA values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy\n\nNoun phrases:\n\n* HBV DNA values\n* pretreatment levels\n* cessation of therapy\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n\nHBV DNA values: disease\npretreatment levels: disease\ncessation of therapy: disease\n3. Identify the disease entities in the paragraph:\n\nBased on the noun phrases and nouns identified in step 2, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* HBV (Hepatitis B virus)\n* levels (referring to the disease state of the HBV infection)\n* therapy (referring to the treatment of the HBV infection)\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are HBV and the related disease states of levels and therapy."},
