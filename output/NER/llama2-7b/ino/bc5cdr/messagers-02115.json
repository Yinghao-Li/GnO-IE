Histamine: Histamine is a chemical messenger involved in various physiological processes, including immune response, allergic reactions, and gastric acid secretion. In the context of the paragraph, histamine refers to the chemical that cimetidine acts as an agonist of.\n2. Agonist: An agonist is a molecule that activates or mimics the action of another molecule, in this case, histamine. Cimetidine acts as a histamine agonist, meaning it binds to histamine receptors and activates them, leading to the effects described in the paragraph."},
