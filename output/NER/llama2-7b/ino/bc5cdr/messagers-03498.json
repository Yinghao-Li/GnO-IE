This suggests that the study is focused on cardiovascular disease.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypertension\n2. Cardiovascular disease"},

Infusions - This refers to the infusion of a substance (e.g., a drug) into the body through a vein.\n2. Haemodynamic - This refers to the study of the movement of blood and its components within the circulatory system.\n3. Hemoglobin - This is a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.\n4. Arterial - This refers to the arteries, which are blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the rest of the body.\n5. Ambulatory - This refers to the act of walking or moving around, especially for medical testing or monitoring.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Infusions (a substance)\n2. Haemodynamic (a system)\n3. Hemoglobin (a protein)\n4. Arterial (a blood vessel)\n5. Ambulatory (a medical term for movement)"},
