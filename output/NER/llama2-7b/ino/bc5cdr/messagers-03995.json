Brain: This is the organ where the regulation of sodium balance is supposed to occur.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.

Angiotensin II dysfunction (absence of an adjusting control of angiotensin II forming and receptor binding capacity for sodium balance in the brain)"},

Plasma osmolality: This refers to the concentration of solutes in the blood plasma.\n3. Angiotensin II: This is a peptide hormone that helps regulate blood pressure by constricting blood vessels.\n4. Receptor: A receptor is a protein on the surface of a cell that responds to specific molecules, such as hormones or neurotransmitters. In this case, the receptor is likely referring to the receptor for angiotensin II.\n5. Sodium balance: This refers to the balance of sodium ions in the body, which is important for maintaining proper fluid balance and blood pressure.\n\nI hope that helps!
