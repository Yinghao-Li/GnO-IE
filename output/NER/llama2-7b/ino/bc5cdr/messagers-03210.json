Cyclosporine-induced nephropathy: This is the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to the kidney damage caused by cyclosporine, an immunosuppressive drug.\n2. Nephropathy: This is a broader term that refers to any type of kidney disease.\n3. Serum: This refers to the liquid part of the blood that carries proteins, nutrients, hormones, and waste products.\n4. Urine: This refers to the waste product that is produced by the kidneys and excreted through the urinary system.\n5. Gene: This refers to the genetic material that contains the instructions for the development and function of an organism.\n6. Protein: This refers to a large, complex molecule that consists of amino acids that are linked together in a specific sequence.\n7. Renal expression biomarkers: This refers to the molecules or markers that are expressed in the kidneys and can be used to diagnose or monitor kidney disease.\n\nSo, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is cyclosporine-induced nephropathy, and the other entities mentioned are related to the study of the disease and its effects on the body."},
