To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Dyskinesias\": This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. Dyskinesias refer to abnormal movements of the body, often characterized by involuntary and repetitive movements of the limbs or other parts of the body.\n2. \"Dystonic dyskinesias\": This is a specific type of dyskinesia that is characterized by involuntary movements that are often twisting or repetitive.\n3. \"Choreic mid - dose dyskinesias\": This is another specific type of dyskinesia that occurs during a certain phase of the disease (in this case, \"mid - dose\"). Choreic dyskinesias are characterized by quick, jerky movements that are often accompanied by a stiffness or rigidity in the affected limbs.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Dyskinesias\n* Dystonic dyskinesias\n* Choreic mid - dose dyskinesias"},
