Identify the noun phrases:\n * LV hypertrophy\n * Iso treatment\n * TGR\n * SD rats\n2. Identify the nouns:\n * hypertrophy\n * treatment\n * rats\n3. Identify the verbs:\n * induced\n * was\n4. Identify the adjectives:\n * significantly\n * higher\n * g\n * body\n * wt\n * respectively\n\nBased on the above analysis, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypertrophy (noun)\n* Treatment (noun)\n* Rats (noun)"},

Iso: This is a chemical substance that is being studied in the paragraph. It is likely a drug or a hormone that is being used to induce hypertrophy in the rats.\n2. LV: This stands for \"left ventricle,\" which is a part of the heart. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the left ventricular weight, which is being measured in the study.\n3. TGR: This stands for \"tibialis group,\" which is a reference to a specific group of rats that are being studied in the experiment.\n4. SD: This stands for \"spontaneously hypertensive,\" which is a reference to a specific strain of rat that is being used as a control in the study.\n5. wt: This stands for \"weight,\" which is a measure of the amount of a substance or the mass of an object. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the weight of the left ventricle in grams.\n6. body wt: This stands for \"body weight,\" which is a measure of the total mass of an organism.
