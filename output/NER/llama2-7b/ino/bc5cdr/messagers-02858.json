Neurocognitive disorders: This term encompasses a range of conditions that affect cognitive function, including memory, attention, language, and problem-solving abilities. Examples of neurocognitive disorders include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.\n2. Learning disorders: This term refers to conditions that affect an individual's ability to learn and process information. Examples of learning disorders include dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia.\n3. Memory disorders: This term refers to conditions that affect an individual's ability to remember information. Examples of memory disorders include Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and amnesia.\n4. Executive functioning disorders: This term refers to conditions that affect an individual's ability to regulate their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Examples of executive functioning disorders include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, and traumatic brain injury.\n\nTherefore, the entities identified as \"Disease\" in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
