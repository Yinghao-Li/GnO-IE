COX - 2 inhibitors: This is a class of drugs that are used to reduce inflammation and pain. The \"COX\" in this entity refers to the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is involved in the production of prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxane.\n2. NS - NSAIDs: This is an abbreviation for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These are a class of drugs that are used to reduce inflammation, pain, and fever. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.\n3. acetaminophen: This is a common pain reliever and fever reducer. It is also known as paracetamol.\n\nSo, the three chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. COX - 2 inhibitors\n2. NS - NSAIDs\n3. acetaminophen"},
