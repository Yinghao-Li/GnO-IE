Peripheral neuropathy: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, referring to a type of nerve damage that affects the peripheral nervous system.\n2. Sensory neuropathy: This is a subtype of peripheral neuropathy that specifically affects the sensory nerves, leading to problems with sensation, such as numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation in the affected areas.\n3. Motor neuropathy: This is another subtype of peripheral neuropathy that affects the motor nerves, leading to problems with muscle weakness, twitching, or loss of muscle control.\n4. Autonomic neuropathy: This is a subtype of peripheral neuropathy that affects the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.\n5. Proximal neuropathy: This refers to nerve damage that affects the upper part of the body, including the chest and abdomen.\n6. Distal neuropathy: This refers to nerve damage that affects the lower part of the body, including the legs and feet.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
