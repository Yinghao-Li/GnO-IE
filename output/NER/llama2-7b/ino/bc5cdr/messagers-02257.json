Acute renal failure: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a sudden and severe decline in kidney function.\n2. Serum creatinine: This is a biomarker or a measurable indicator of kidney function, which is increased in the patient's blood in this case, indicating that the patient's kidneys are not functioning properly.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities identified in the paragraph are \"Acute renal failure\" and \"Serum creatinine\"."},
