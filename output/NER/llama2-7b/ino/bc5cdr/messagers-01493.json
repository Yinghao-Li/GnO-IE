Basic emotion\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Percent: The term \"percent\" refers to a unit of measurement that represents a fraction or a part of a hundred. In this context, it is used to express the accuracy of responses.\n2. Accuracy: Accuracy refers to the degree of correctness or precision of a response or measurement. In the context of the paragraph, it is used to describe the percentage of correct responses to emotions.\n3. Latencies: Latencies refer to the time it takes for a response or reaction to occur after a stimulus or trigger. In the context of the paragraph, it is used to describe the time it takes for participants to respond to emotions.\n4. Basic emotion: Basic emotions are a category of emotions that are considered to be fundamental or innate, such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise. In the context of the paragraph, it is used to describe the different emotions that were presented to participants.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Percent\n* Accuracy\n* Latencies\n* Basic emotion"},
