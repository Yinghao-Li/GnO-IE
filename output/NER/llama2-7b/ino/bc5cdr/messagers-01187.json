Hypertrophy: This refers to the enlargement of the heart muscle, which can occur due to various reasons such as hypertension, cardiomyopathy, or other conditions.\n2. Cardiac inotropic response: This refers to the response of the heart muscle to various stimuli, such as beta-AR agonists, which can cause an increase in the heart rate and contractility.\n3. Sympathetic outflow: This refers to the nerve fibers that carry signals from the sympathetic nervous system to the heart, which can regulate the heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypertrophy (heart muscle enlargement)\n* Cardiac inotropic response (increase in heart rate and contractility)\n* Sympathetic outflow (nerve fibers that regulate the heart)"},
