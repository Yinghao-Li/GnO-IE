Percentage is a chemical entity because it represents a proportion or fraction of a whole, which is a mathematical concept.\n2. MELD score is a chemical entity because it is a numerical value used to assess the severity of liver disease, which is a physical property.\n3. Liver cirrhosis is a chemical entity because it is a medical condition characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the liver, which is a physical change in the organ."},
