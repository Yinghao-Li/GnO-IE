Graphical input equipment: Graphical input equipment refers to devices that are used to input or manipulate visual information, such as graphs or charts. In the paragraph, the coordinates of the inversion points are being transferred to punched tape through graphical input equipment.\n3. Punched tape: Punched tape is a type of data storage medium that consists of a length of tape with holes punched in it to represent data. In the paragraph, the coordinates of the inversion points are being transferred to punched tape.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Coordinates\n2.
