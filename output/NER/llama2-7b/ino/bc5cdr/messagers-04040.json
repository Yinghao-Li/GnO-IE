Atypical plasma cholinesterase: This is a genetic condition where the enzyme cholinesterase, which breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, is abnormal or deficient.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Neuromuscular blockade\n2. Atypical plasma cholinesterase"},

Plasma cholinesterase: This is an enzyme that is responsible for breaking down succinylcholine in the bloodstream.\n4.
