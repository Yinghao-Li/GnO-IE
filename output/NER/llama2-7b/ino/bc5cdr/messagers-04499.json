To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"renal disease\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific medical condition affecting the kidneys.\n2. \"rhIGF\" - This is a disease entity, as it is a recombinant form of a protein called insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which is used to treat certain medical conditions, including renal disease.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Renal disease\n* rhIGF"},
