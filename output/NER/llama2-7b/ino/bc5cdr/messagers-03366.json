To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"patients\" - This is the first disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It refers to the individuals who are being treated with the antibiotic regimen.\n2. \"therapeutic efficacy\" - This is a disease entity that refers to the effectiveness of the antibiotic regimen in treating the underlying disease or condition.\n3. \"acceptable renal toxicity\" - This is also a disease entity, as it refers to the potential harmful effects of the antibiotic regimen on the kidneys.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Patients\n* Therapeutic efficacy\n* Renal toxicity"},
