Heart rate: The term \"heart rate\" refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute. It is a physiological parameter that can be affected by various chemical factors, such as hormones, drugs, and other chemical substances. In the context of the paragraph, the heart rate of patients with MD is being compared to other groups, suggesting that there may be a chemical-related difference in heart rate between these groups.\n2. Greenhouse-Geisser correction: This is a statistical technique used to analyze data from repeated measures or non-independent samples. It is a type of correction method that accounts for the non-independent observations in the data, which can arise due to the use of chemical substances or other factors that affect the outcome being measured. In the context of the paragraph, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction is being used to analyze the data from the patients with MD and other groups."},
