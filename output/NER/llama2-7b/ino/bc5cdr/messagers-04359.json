SHR (Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats) - a type of rat strain commonly used in scientific research to study hypertension and cardiovascular disease.\n2. WKY (Wistar Kyoto) - another type of rat strain commonly used in scientific research, known for its resistance to hypertension and cardiovascular disease.\n3. MAP (mean arterial pressure) - a measure of blood pressure in the circulatory system.\n4. CCB (calcium channel blocker) - a type of medication used to treat high blood pressure and other cardiovascular conditions by blocking the flow of calcium ions into cardiac muscle cells.\n5. AVP (arginine vasopressin) - a hormone produced by the hypothalamus in the brain that helps regulate blood pressure.\n6.
