Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Major depressive disorder (MDD): MDD is a mental disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities. It is a neurological disorder that affects the levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain.\n2. Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD): ASPD is a mental disorder characterized by a lack of empathy, impulsivity, and a disregard for the feelings and rights of others. It is believed to be associated with abnormalities in the brain's reward system and the levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine.\n\nIn both cases, the disorders are related to abnormalities in the levels or functioning of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which are chemical messengers that play a crucial role in regulating various physiological and psychological processes."},
