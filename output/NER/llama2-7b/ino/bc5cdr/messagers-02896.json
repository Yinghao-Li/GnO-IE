Identify the noun phrases:\n * Neutropenia\n * toxic effect\n * treatment\n * CCNU\n * CTX\n2. Identify the proper nouns:\n * Neutropenia (disease entity)\n * CCNU (chemotherapy drug)\n * CTX (chemotherapy drug)\n3. Identify the abstract nouns:\n * effect (outcome)\n4. Identify the countable nouns:\n * frequency (outcome)\n * percentage (outcome)\n\nBased on the above analysis, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Neutropenia (a type of blood disorder)\n2. CCNU (a chemotherapy drug)\n3. CTX (a chemotherapy drug)\n\nSo, the paragraph is talking about the toxic effects of CCNU and CTX on the frequency of grade 4 neutropenia in patients."},
