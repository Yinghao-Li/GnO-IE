It refers to a type of kidney disease caused by the accumulation of aminonucleosides, which are compounds that contain a nitrogenous base and a sugar molecule.\n2. \"Protamine\" is a disease entity. It is a type of protein that is used to treat certain medical conditions, including aminonucleoside nephrosis.\n3. \"Co-administration\" is a disease entity. It refers to the act of giving two or more drugs or substances together, often to achieve a specific therapeutic effect. In this case, the co-administration of protamine and aminonucleoside nephrosis is being discussed.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Aminonucleoside nephrosis\n* Protamine\n* Co-administration"},
