Rhabdomyolysis - The peak level of CK in the patient's blood is 62 IU/L, which is within the range of rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue.\n3. Myocardial infarction - The patient was treated with intravenous normal saline, which may indicate that they were experiencing a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, which can cause elevated levels of CK in the blood.\n\nTherefore, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are rhabdomyolysis and myocardial infarction."},
