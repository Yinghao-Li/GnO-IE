WDS (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome) - This is a brain disorder caused by a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B1) and characterized by confusion, memory loss, and difficulty with coordination and muscle control.\n2. Haloperidol catalepsy - This is a side effect of the drug haloperidol, which is used to treat psychotic disorders. It is characterized by a stiff, rigid body position and a lack of spontaneous movement.\n3. Penile erections - This is a normal physiological response in males, characterized by an erection of the penis. However, in the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned that pretreatment with fluoxetine (an antidepressant) can suppress penile erections.\n\nI hope this helps!
