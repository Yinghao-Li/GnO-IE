Identify the keywords:\n * Blood\n * cultures\n * S. aureus\n * oxacillin\n2. Determine the relationships:\n * Blood cultures are a type of medical test that involves growing microorganisms in a laboratory setting.\n * S. aureus is a type of bacteria that can cause infections.\n * Oxacillin is an antibiotic that is effective against S. aureus.\n3. Identify the disease entities:\n * Based on the information provided, the disease entity is likely \"Bacterial infection\" or \"Staphylococcal infection\".\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is \"Bacterial infection\"."},
