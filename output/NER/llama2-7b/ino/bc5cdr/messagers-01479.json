Surgery: The term \"surgery\" refers to a medical procedure that involves the use of chemicals (such as anesthetics) to alter the body's tissues or organs.\n2. Postoperative: The term \"postoperative\" refers to the time period after a surgical procedure, which may involve the use of chemicals (such as pain medication) to manage symptoms or promote healing.\n3. Day: The term \"day\" is a unit of time that can be used to describe the timing of a surgical procedure or the postoperative period, during which chemicals (such as anesthetics or pain medication) may be administered.\n\nTherefore, the only \"Chemical\" entities identified in the given paragraph are \"surgery\" and \"postoperative\"."},
