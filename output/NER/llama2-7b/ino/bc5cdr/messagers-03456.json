Rebound phenomenon: This refers to the return of a physiological response to a stimulus after it has been suppressed. In the context of blood pressure and heart rate, rebound phenomenon refers to the increase in blood pressure and heart rate that can occur after a period of hypotension.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.

Hypotension: This is a medical condition characterized by low blood pressure, which can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, blood loss, or certain medications.\n2.
