Interstitial cystitis: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, and it refers to a chronic bladder condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the bladder lining.\n2. Leaky bladder epithelium: This refers to a condition where the epithelial lining of the bladder is damaged or permeable, allowing fluid to leak out of the bladder.\n3. Mucosal mastocytosis: This is a condition where there is an abnormal increase in the number of mast cells in the mucous membranes of the bladder. Mast cells are a type of immune cell that play a role in the immune response.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
