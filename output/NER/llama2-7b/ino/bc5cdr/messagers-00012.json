Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * None\n * patients\n * decompensated\n * liver\n * disease\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * None (no noun)\n * patients (plural noun)\n * decompensated (adjective)\n * liver (noun)\n * disease (noun)\n3. Determine if each noun is a disease entity:\n * None (no disease entity)\n * patients (no disease entity)\n * decompensated (no disease entity)\n * liver (yes, \"liver\" is a disease entity)\n * disease (yes, \"disease\" is a disease entity)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"liver\" and \"disease\"."},
