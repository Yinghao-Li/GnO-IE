To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"vasopressor responses\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific abnormality in the body's response to certain stimuli.\n2. \"distinct from the cranial circulation\" - This is a modifying clause that provides more information about the vasopressor responses. It does not refer to a specific disease entity.\n3. \"systemic circulation\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the circulatory system in the body as a whole.\n4. \"pulmonary circulation\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the circulatory system in the lungs.\n5. \"coronary circulation\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the circulatory system in the heart.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Vasopressor responses\n* Systemic circulation\n* Pulmonary circulation\n* Coronary circulation"},
