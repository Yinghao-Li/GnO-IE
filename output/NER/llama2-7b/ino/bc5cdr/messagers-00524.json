Carvedilol: This is a medication that is used to treat heart failure and high blood pressure. It is a beta-blocker, which means it works by blocking the effects of the hormone adrenaline on the heart.\n2. Doxorubicin: This is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. It works by killing cancer cells or slowing their growth.\n3. Mitochondria: These are organelles found in the cells of the body that are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Mitochondrial dysfunction can occur when the mitochondria are damaged or do not function properly.\n4. Cardiomyopathy: This is a disease of the heart muscle that can lead to heart failure. It can occur due to a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, infections, and exposure to toxins.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
