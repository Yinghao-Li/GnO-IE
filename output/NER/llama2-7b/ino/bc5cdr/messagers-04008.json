Angina - This is a type of chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood.\n2. Propranolol - This is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and certain types of angina.\n3. Sinus rhythm - This refers to the normal, regular heartbeat that originates in the sinus node, which is a small group of cells in the heart that acts as the heart's natural pacemaker.\n4. Sinoatrial (S-A) block - This is a type of heart rhythm disorder in which the electrical signals that control the heart's rhythm are blocked or delayed between the sinus node and the atrioventricular (AV) node.\n\nI hope this helps!

Sinus rhythm: This refers to the normal, regular heartbeat pattern of the sinus node, which is the natural pacemaker of the heart.\n3. Sinoatrial (S-A) block: This refers to a type of heart block, which is a disruption of the normal electrical conduction system of the heart. In S-A block, the electrical signal from the sinus node is blocked or delayed, leading to abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Propranolol (a medication)\n2. Sinus rhythm (a normal heartbeat pattern)\n3. Sinoatrial (S-A) block (a type of heart block)"},
