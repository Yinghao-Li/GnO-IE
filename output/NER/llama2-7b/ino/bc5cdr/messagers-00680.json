Gustatory hyperhidrosis: This is the primary condition mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to excessive sweating in response to taste stimuli.\n2. Hyperhidrosis: This is a broader term that refers to excessive sweating in general, without specifying the type of stimulus that triggers it.\n3. Transthroacic endoscopic sympathectomy: This is a surgical procedure mentioned in the paragraph, which involves cutting or destroying the nerves that transmit signals from the sympathetic nervous system to the sweat glands.\n4. Compensatory focal hyperhidrosis: This is a secondary condition that occurs after the surgical procedure, where the body compensates for the loss of sweat glands by producing excessive sweat in other areas of the body.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
