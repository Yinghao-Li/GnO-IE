Six (12%)\nb. 4 (8%)\nc. hand-foot syndrome\nd. stomatitis\n\n2. Determine whether each noun phrase is a disease entity or not:\n\na. Six (12%) - Not a disease entity\nb. 4 (8%) - Not a disease entity\nc. hand-foot syndrome - Disease entity\nd. stomatitis - Disease entity\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"hand-foot syndrome\" and \"stomatitis\"."},
