It is a dopamine precursor that can help replace dopamine in the brain, which is deficient in Parkinson's disease.\n2. dopamine: This is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motor control and movement. In Parkinson's disease, there is a loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to bradykinesia, rigidity, and other motor symptoms.\n\nI hope this helps!
