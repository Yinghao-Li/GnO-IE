Calcium: This is the chemical element that is being discussed in the paragraph. Calcium is a essential mineral that is important for many bodily functions, including muscle function, nerve function, and bone health.\n2. Calcium carbonate: This is a chemical compound that is used in hemodialysis patients to treat hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels in the blood). Calcium carbonate is a common antacid that is used to neutralize stomach acid and relieve heartburn and indigestion.\n3. Therapy: This is a general term that refers to the treatment or management of a medical condition. In this context, calcium carbonate therapy is the treatment of hypercalcemia in hemodialysis patients.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
