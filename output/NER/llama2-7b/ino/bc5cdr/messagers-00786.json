Ischemic changes: This refers to a reduction in blood flow to a specific area of the brain, which can cause damage to the brain tissue.\n3. Left cerebral hemisphere: This refers to the left half of the brain, which is affected by the disease.\n4. Left putamen: This is a structure in the brain that is involved in movement and cognition, and is also affected by the disease.\n\nSo, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
