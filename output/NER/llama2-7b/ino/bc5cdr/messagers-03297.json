Identify the keywords:\n * Hb: hemoglobin\n * levels: refers to the amount of hemoglobin in the blood\n * follow-up period: refers to the time period during which the patients were monitored\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * patients: individuals who are being studied or treated\n * decrease: a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood\n * 23: a specific number of patients (11.4% of the total patients)\n * 2-5 g/dL: a specific range of hemoglobin levels (2-5 grams per deciliter)\n3. Determine the disease entities associated with the identified entities:\n * Based on the information provided in the paragraph, there is no direct mention of any specific disease entities. However, a decrease in hemoglobin levels between 2 and 5 g/dL can be indicative of anemia, which is a condition characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity associated with the paragraph is anemia."},
