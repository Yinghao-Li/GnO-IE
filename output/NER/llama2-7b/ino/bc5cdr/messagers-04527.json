Myocardial infarction: This is a type of heart attack caused by the blockage of a coronary artery, which leads to damage or death of the heart muscle.\n2. Isoproterenol: This is a medication that is used to simulate the effects of the hormone epinephrine on the body. It is used to treat certain heart conditions, such as angina, but it can also cause cardiac arrhythmias and other adverse effects.\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is myocardial infarction, and the disease-related entity that is being studied or affected by the exercise is isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction."},
