Levodopa: Levodopa is an amino acid that is converted into dopamine in the brain. It is used to treat Parkinson's disease and its symptoms.\n2. Drug: The term \"drug\" is used generically to refer to any chemical substance that can alter the body's function or produce a therapeutic effect. In this context, the \"drug\" refers to the medication that is causing the drug-induced dyskinesias.\n3. Dyskinesias: Dyskinesias are abnormal movements that can occur as a side effect of long-term use of dopaminergic medications, such as levodopa. They are characterized by involuntary, jerky movements that can affect various parts of the body."},
