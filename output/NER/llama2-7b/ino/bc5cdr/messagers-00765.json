Pure red cell aplasia: This is a rare blood disorder characterized by a severe reduction in the number of red blood cells in the body. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including certain medications, infections, and genetic disorders.\n2. Toxic dermatitis: This is a type of skin reaction that occurs when the skin comes into contact with a toxic substance. It can cause redness, itching, swelling, and blistering of the skin.\n3. Lymphadenopathy: This is a condition where the lymph nodes become inflamed or enlarged. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.\n\nSo, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Pure red cell aplasia\n2.
