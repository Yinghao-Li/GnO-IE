    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Disease\":\n\n1. Torsade de Pointes (TdP): This is a type of abnormal heart rhythm, specifically a ventricular arrhythmia characterized by a specific pattern of QRS complexes on an electrocardiogram (ECG). TdP can be caused by various factors, including certain medications, such as IKr blockers (including Terfenadine and Citalopram).\n2. Early afterdepolarization (EAD): This is a type of cardiac arrhythmia that occurs when the ventricles of the heart depolarize too early, before the normal conduction pathway has a chance to take over. EAD can increase the risk of developing TdP.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Torsade de Pointes (TdP)\n2. Early afterdepolarization (EAD)"},
