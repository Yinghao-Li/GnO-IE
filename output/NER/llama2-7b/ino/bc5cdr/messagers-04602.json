Cancer: The paragraph mentions \"34 patients evaluable for response,\" which implies that these patients are being evaluated for the effectiveness of a treatment for a specific disease, which is likely cancer.\n2. Disease: The paragraph mentions \"response,\" which is a measure of how well a treatment is working for a disease. Therefore, \"Disease\" is an entity that is being studied or evaluated in the context of the paragraph.\n3. Response: This entity is mentioned as a measure of how well a treatment is working for a disease. It is the outcome or result of the treatment, and it is being evaluated in the context of the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cancer\n2. Disease\n3. Response"},
