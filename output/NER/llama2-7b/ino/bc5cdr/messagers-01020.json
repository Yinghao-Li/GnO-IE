Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): This is the main disease of interest in the paragraph, as the study is focused on the association between regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and the development of ESRD.\n2. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These are the drugs that are being studied in the context of their potential impact on ESRD. NSAIDs are a class of medications commonly used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
