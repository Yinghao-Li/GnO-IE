Immunosuppressive disease: This is the disease that Azathioprine is used to treat or manage.\n\nExplanation: Immunosuppressive drugs are used to suppress or reduce the immune system's response to a disease or condition. In this case, Azathioprine is used to suppress the immune system to prevent it from attacking the body's own tissues, which can occur in diseases such as organ transplantation.\n\n2. Organ transplantation disease: This is the disease or condition that Azathioprine is used to prevent or manage in patients who have undergone organ transplantation.\n\nExplanation: Organ transplantation is a surgical procedure that involves transplanting a healthy organ from one person (the donor) to another person (the recipient). However, the recipient's immune system may recognize the transplanted organ as foreign and attack it, leading to rejection of the organ. Azathioprine can help prevent or manage this rejection by suppressing the immune system's response to the transplanted organ."},
