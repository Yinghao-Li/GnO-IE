To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Reduced cardiotoxicity\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a decrease in the toxicity of a drug to the heart.\n2. \"doxorubicin\" - This is a disease entity, as it is a chemotherapy drug that can cause cardiotoxicity.\n3. \"N - ( 2 - hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide conjugates\" - This is not a disease entity, as it is a chemical compound used to modify the drug doxorubicin to reduce its cardiotoxicity.\n4. \"experimental study in the rat\" - This is not a disease entity, as it is a study design used to investigate the effectiveness of the modified drug in a laboratory setting.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Doxorubicin (a chemotherapy drug that can cause cardiotoxicity)\n* Cardiotoxicity (a general term for damage to the heart caused by a drug or other substance)"},
