Heparin: This is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph as the cause of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II. Heparin is an anticoagulant drug used to prevent blood clots.\n2. Thrombocytopenia: This is a medical condition where the platelet count in the blood is low. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II.\n3. Platelets: These are small, irregularly-shaped blood cells that play a crucial role in blood clotting. In the paragraph, the platelet count is mentioned as being affected by heparin.\n4. Liver graft: This is a surgical procedure where a portion of a liver is removed from a donor and transplanted into a recipient. In the paragraph, the liver graft recipients are being studied for their postoperative recovery of platelet count.\n5. Postoperative: This refers to the period of time after a surgical procedure. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the recovery of platelet count in liver graft recipients after the surgery.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Heparin\n* Thrombocytopenia\n* Platelets\n* Liver graft\n* Postoperative"},
