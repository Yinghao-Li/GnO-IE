Chronic lithium therapy: This is a medical treatment that is used to manage bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions.\n2. Serum calcium level: This refers to the level of calcium in the blood. Abnormalities in serum calcium levels can indicate various diseases or disorders, such as hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or hypercalcemia (high calcium levels).\n3. Parathyroid glands: These are small glands located in the neck that regulate calcium levels in the blood. Diseases or disorders of the parathyroid glands can cause abnormalities in calcium levels, such as hyperparathyroidism (too much parathyroid hormone) or hypoparathyroidism (too little parathyroid hormone).\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are chronic lithium therapy, serum calcium level, and parathyroid glands."},
