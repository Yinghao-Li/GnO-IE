Chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (CPAN) - This is the disease that Temocapril is being studied for its effect on. CPAN is a type of kidney disease that is caused by the accumulation of toxic substances in the kidneys.\n2. Nephrosis - This is a broader term that refers to any type of damage or disease affecting the kidneys.\n3. Glomerular injury - This refers to damage to the glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n\nSo, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is CPAN, and the specific aspect of the disease being studied is the glomerular injury that occurs in this condition."},
