Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Induction agent\n * salt preparation\n * scoline pain\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Induction agent: Althesin, Thiopentone\n * Salt preparation: chloride, bromide\n * scoline pain: scoline pain\n3. Check if any of the nouns are disease entities:\n * Althesin: No, Althesin is not a disease entity.\n * Thiopentone: No, Thiopentone is not a disease entity.\n * Chloride: No, chloride is not a disease entity.\n * Bromide: No, bromide is not a disease entity.\n * Scoline pain: Yes, scoline pain is a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"scoline pain\"."},
