To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"GLS\" (Global LV Strain): This is a measure of the heart's ability to pump blood effectively, and a decrease in GLS can indicate cardiac dysfunction.\n2. \"cTnT\" (cardiac Troponin T): This is a protein that is released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged, and an elevation in cTnT levels can indicate cardiac injury or toxicity.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cardiotoxicity\n* Heart dysfunction\n* Cardiac injury\n\nThese are the conditions that the paragraph is suggesting can be predicted by the changes in GLS and cTnT levels from baseline to the third cycle of chemotherapy."},
