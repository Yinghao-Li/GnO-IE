To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Behavioural effects\" - This is not a disease entity, but rather a general term that refers to the way an organism behaves.\n2. \"Context dependent conditioned emotional response test (CER)\" - This is not a disease entity either, but rather a test or procedure used to measure the emotional response of an animal.\n3. \"Animals treated with 5-FU\" - \"5-FU\" is a disease entity, as it is a chemical compound that is used as a chemotherapy drug in cancer treatment.\n4. \"Controls\" - \"Controls\" is not a disease entity, but rather a term used to refer to a group of animals that are not treated with the chemical compound (in this case, 5-FU).\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"5-FU\"."},
