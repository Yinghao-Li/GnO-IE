Left ventricular diastolic pressure (LVdp) - a measure of the pressure in the left ventricle of the heart during diastole.\n4. Left ventricular relaxation rate (LVRR) - a measure of the rate at which the left ventricle relaxes and fills with blood during diastole.\n5. Heart failure - a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
