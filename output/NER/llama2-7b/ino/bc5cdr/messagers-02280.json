Neurologic toxicities: This is a general term that refers to any type of toxic effect on the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.\n2. Methotrexate: Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug that can cause neurotoxicity, including neurological symptoms such as confusion, dizziness, and numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.\n3. Cytosine arabinoside: Cytosine arabinoside is another chemotherapy drug that can cause neurotoxicity, including nausea, vomiting, and seizures.\n4. TSPA: TSPA stands for \"Tumor Stroma-Associated\" and is a term used to describe a type of immune cell that is found in the tumor microenvironment. However, in this context, it is likely referring to a different entity, possibly a toxin or a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Neurologic toxicities\n2. Methotrexate toxicity\n3. Cytosine arabinoside toxicity\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
