Myocardial: This refers to the muscular tissue of the heart.\n2. catecholamines: This is a term that refers to a group of hormones, including norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine.\n3. VIP: This stands for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, which is a hormone that is produced in the intestine and has a variety of effects on the body, including regulation of smooth muscle contraction and secretion of hormones.\n\nSo, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the disease entities are:\n\n* Myocardial disease (related to the heart muscle)\n* Catecholamine imbalance (related to the hormone levels in the body)\n* VIP imbalance (related to the hormone levels in the body)"},
