Glomerular hypertrophy: This refers to an abnormal enlargement of the glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n2. Segmental glomerulosclerosis: This refers to the hardening of the glomeruli, which can lead to scarring and loss of kidney function.\n3. Tubulointerstitial injury: This refers to damage to the tubules and interstitium, which are the tiny tubes and tissue between the glomeruli in the kidneys. This damage can lead to inflammation and scarring, which can impair kidney function.\n4. Renal cortical malondialdehyde content: This refers to the level of a chemical called malondialdehyde in the outer layer of the kidney, which can be a sign of oxidative stress and inflammation in the kidneys.\n\nI hope this helps!
