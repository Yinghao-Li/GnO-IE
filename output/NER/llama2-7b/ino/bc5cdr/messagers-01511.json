Parvalbumin: This is a protein that is expressed in certain types of neurons, and its staining can be used to detect neuronal damage.\n2. Nissl: Nissl staining is a technique used to visualize neuronal structure and detect neuronal damage. It is based on the staining of neurons with a dye called Nissl's reagent, which highlights the dark-staining substances in neurons.\n\nSo, the two \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Parvalbumin staining changed in the central SNR (structural nucleus of the optic nerve), indicating neuronal damage.\n2. Nissl staining visualized some neuronal distortion."},
