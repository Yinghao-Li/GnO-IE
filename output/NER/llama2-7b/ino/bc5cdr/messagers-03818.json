Myocardial excitability: This refers to the ability of the heart muscle cells to respond to electrical signals and contract properly.\n2. Contractility: This refers to the ability of the heart muscle cells to contract and relax properly, which is essential for efficient pumping of blood throughout the body.\n3. Metabolic characteristics: This refers to the various chemical reactions that occur within the heart muscle cells to produce energy and maintain proper function.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myocardial excitability\n2. Contractility\n3. Metabolic characteristics\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
