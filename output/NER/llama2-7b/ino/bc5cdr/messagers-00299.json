Prenatal cocaine exposure: This is the exposure of a developing fetus to cocaine during pregnancy. Cocaine is a drug that can pass through the placenta and reach the fetus, potentially causing harmful effects on the developing brain and body.\n2. Cranial sonographic findings: This refers to the results of a sonogram (a medical imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of the body) performed on preterm infants to evaluate their brain development and structure.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Prenatal cocaine exposure (a type of exposure or environmental factor that can cause harm to the developing fetus)\n2. Cranial sonographic findings (a specific diagnostic test used to evaluate brain development and structure in preterm infants)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

Cocaine: This is a chemical substance that is illegal in many countries and can have serious health consequences when used during pregnancy.\n3. Exposure: This refers to the contact or interaction between the fetus and the cocaine during pregnancy.\n4. Cranial: This refers to the skull or head.\n5.
