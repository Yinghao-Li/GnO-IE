Dexmedetomidine: This is a sedative medication that is used to induce and maintain sedation in critically ill patients. It is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, which means it acts on specific receptors in the brain to produce sedation.\n2. Propofol: This is an anesthetic medication that is used to induce and maintain anesthesia. It works by slowing down the activity of the nervous system, leading to a state of unconsciousness.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are dexmedetomidine and propofol."},
