Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) - This is the disease or condition being studied in the paragraph. It is a type of chronic pain that occurs after a shingles infection.\n2. Neuropathic pain - This is a type of pain that results from damage to the nerves. It is a common complication of shingles and is the focus of the study.\n3. Interference with neuropeptide metabolism - This refers to the idea that the capsaicin may affect the way neuropeptides are processed and metabolized in the body, which could contribute to its analgesic effects.\n4. Morphological changes (perhaps degeneration) of nociceptive afferents - This refers to the idea that the capsaicin may cause changes in the structure and function of nociceptive afferents, which are nerve fibers that transmit pain signals. This could also contribute to its analgesic effects."},
