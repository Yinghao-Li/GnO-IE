Tachypnea (rapid respiratory rate)\n4. Hypoxia (low oxygen saturation)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Hypertension: The paragraph mentions \"blood pressure\" being monitored, which is a common indicator of hypertension (high blood pressure).\n2. Tachycardia: The paragraph mentions \"heart rate\" being monitored, which is a common indicator of tachycardia (rapid heart rate).\n3. Tachypnea: The paragraph mentions \"respiratory rate\" being monitored, which is a common indicator of tachypnea (rapid respiratory rate).\n4. Hypoxia: The paragraph mentions \"oxygen saturation\" being monitored, which is a common indicator of hypoxia (low oxygen saturation).\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia."},

Blood: This is a fluid that circulates throughout the body and contains various chemical components, including proteins, sugars, hormones, and gases.\n2. Oxygen: This is a chemical element that is essential for the proper functioning of the body's cells and is carried in the bloodstream.\n3. Carbon dioxide: This is a chemical compound that is produced in the body as a byproduct of metabolism and is carried in the bloodstream.\n4. Hormones: These are chemical messengers that are produced by endocrine glands and help regulate various bodily functions, including metabolism, growth, and development.\n5. Sugars: These are simple or complex carbohydrates that are found in the bloodstream and provide energy to the body's cells.\n\nNote: While \"oxygen saturation\" is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, it is a measure of the percentage of oxygen-bound hemoglobin in the blood, which is an important indicator of oxygenation of the body's tissues."},
