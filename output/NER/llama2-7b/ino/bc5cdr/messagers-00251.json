Identify the keywords:\n * MPO - ANCA: These are two autoantibodies that are commonly used to diagnose certain autoimmune diseases.\n * PTU: This stands for \"pyrimethamine-tetracycline,\" which is a medication used to treat malaria.\n2. Identify the context:\n * The paragraph is discussing the relationship between the appearance of MPO - ANCA and PTU.\n3. Identify the disease entities:\n * Based on the context and keywords, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n  + Autoimmune diseases: The appearance of MPO - ANCA is often associated with autoimmune diseases such as vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and lung disease.\n  + Malaria: PTU is a medication used to treat malaria.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Autoimmune diseases\n* Malaria"},
