Fibrosis: This is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by the excessive deposition of fibrous tissue in the orbital soft tissues, leading to stiffness and restriction of movement.\n2. Orbital soft tissue fibrosis: This is a type of fibrosis that affects the soft tissues of the orbit, including the conjunctiva, cornea, and sclera.\n3. Mechanical restriction of eye movements: This is a condition where the fibrosis in the orbital soft tissues causes restriction of the movement of the eyes, making it difficult to move them in different directions.\n4. Enucleation: This is a surgical procedure where the eye is removed from the orbit due to severe damage or disease.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
