Identify the words that suggest a disease or medical condition:\n * dyskinesia\n * visual hallucinations\n2. Check if these words are associated with a specific disease or condition:\n * Dyskinesia is a type of movement disorder that can be associated with various neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and tardive dyskinesia.\n * Visual hallucinations can be a symptom of various neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, dementia, and migraines.\n3. Check if there are any genetic associations with the disease entities:\n * The paragraph mentions the \"rs4704559 G allele,\" which is a genetic variant associated with the disease entities.\n4. Identify the disease entity associated with the genetic variant:\n * Based on the information provided in step 3, the disease entity associated with the \"rs4704559 G allele\" is dyskinesia.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are dyskinesia and visual hallucinations."},
