H2-antagonists: These are medications that block the action of histamine on histamine receptors in the body, specifically on H2 receptors. H2-antagonists are used to treat conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are H1-antagonists and H2-antagonists."},
