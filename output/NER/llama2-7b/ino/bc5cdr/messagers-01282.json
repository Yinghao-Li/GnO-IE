CAA is a genetic disorder that affects the transport of amino acids in the kidneys, leading to the accumulation of toxic substances and kidney damage.\n2. hRPTEC stands for human proximal tubule cells, which are cells that line the proximal tubules of the kidney and play a critical role in the filtration of waste products from the blood.\n\nI hope this helps!
