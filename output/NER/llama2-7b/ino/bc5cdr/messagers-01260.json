Survival: Survival is a measure of the proportion of patients who are alive at a given time after treatment. It is a chemical concept as it is a measure of the concentration of living cells or biological molecules in the body.\n2. Percentage: Percentage is a chemical concept as it is a measure of a fraction or proportion of a whole, which can be expressed as a chemical equation.\n3. Years: Years is a chemical concept as it is a unit of time, which can be expressed as a chemical equation.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Survival\n2.
