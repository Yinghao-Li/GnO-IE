Models - This is a general term that refers to a set of mathematical equations or a theoretical framework used to describe a particular system or process.

In the context of the paragraph, the reproducibility of the models refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same results when using the same model or set of models to describe a particular chemical system or process.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
