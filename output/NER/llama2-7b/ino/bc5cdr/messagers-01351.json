Time - dependent exposures: This entity represents the exposure to a disease or condition that changes over time.\n\nExplanation: In the context of the paragraph, \"time-dependent exposures\" refers to the exposure to a disease or condition that varies over time, such as a disease that progresses or resolves over a period of time.\n\n2. Cox regression models: This entity represents a statistical model used to analyze the relationship between a disease or condition and a set of risk factors.\n\nExplanation: Cox regression is a statistical model used to analyze the relationship between a disease or condition and a set of risk factors, taking into account the time dimension of the data. In the context of the paragraph, Cox regression models are used to compare outcomes in the presence of time-dependent exposures.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are \"time-dependent exposures\" and \"Cox regression models\"."},

Cox regression models: This is a statistical model used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, including time-dependent exposures. While Cox regression models are not chemical entities themselves, they are used to analyze the effects of chemical exposures on outcomes.\n2. Time-dependent exposures: This refers to the exposure to chemicals or other substances that varies over time. Time-dependent exposures are an important consideration in toxicology and environmental health studies, as they can help to identify the potential health effects of chemicals at different stages of exposure.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
