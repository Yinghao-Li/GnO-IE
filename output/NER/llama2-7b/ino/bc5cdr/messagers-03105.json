Cardiac arrhythmia: This is a more specific disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to abnormal heart rhythms in the cardiac muscle.\n3. Ventricular myocytes: These are the cells in the heart muscle that are affected by Ca (2+) overload and lead to arrhythmia.\n\nSo, the three disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
