Cytoplasm - This is a term that refers to the fluid inside a cell, including the organelles and other substances that are present inside the cell. In this context, the term \"cytoplasmic transformation\" refers to changes in the structure or organization of the cytoplasm of the cells being studied.\n3. Immunohistochemical analyses - This is a specific technique used in molecular biology to study the distribution and localization of specific proteins or other molecules within cells.
