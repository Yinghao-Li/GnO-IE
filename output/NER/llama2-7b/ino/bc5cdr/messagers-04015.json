Arrhythmia: The paragraph uses the term \"alternative rhythm,\" which refers to an abnormal heart rhythm that is different from a normal sinus rhythm. This could be any type of arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or other types of irregular heartbeats.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
