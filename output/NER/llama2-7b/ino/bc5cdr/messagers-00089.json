Stress: This is a general term that refers to any external or internal factor that causes changes in the body's physiological state. In this context, stress refers to the physical or psychological stimuli that the body is exposed to.\n2. Relaxation: This term refers to the body's response to the cessation of stress or the return to a state of calmness. Relaxation is a chemical process that involves the release of various chemicals in the body, such as neurotransmitters and hormones, that help to reduce tension and promote feelings of calmness and well-being.\n3. Isovolumic: This term refers to the state of having the same volume or amount of a substance. In the context of the paragraph, isovolumic refers to the fact that the relaxation period was prolonged for the same amount of time (45 minutes) after each form of stress.\n4. p: This is a symbol used in statistical analysis to represent the probability of a certain event occurring. In the paragraph, p < 0.05 refers to the probability of the relaxation period being prolonged after each form of stress, which was found to be statistically significant.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
