Risk factors: Risk factors are variables or conditions that increase the likelihood of developing a particular disease or condition. In this context, the study is focused on identifying the risk factors for posttransplant mortality.\n2. Impact: Impact refers to the effect or influence of a particular event or condition on a system or process. In this context, the study aims to examine the impact of posttransplant mortality on the recipient's health.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Chemical\" entities identified in the paragraph are \"Risk factors\" and \"Impact\"."},
