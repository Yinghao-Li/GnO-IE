    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Eighty - seven percent\" refers to a percentage of patients, which is a disease entity.\n2. \"patients\" refers to a group of individuals who are suffering from a particular disease or condition.\n3. \"immunomodulatory drugs\" are a type of medication used to treat diseases related to the immune system, such as autoimmune disorders or inflammatory conditions.\n4. \"included in some line of therapy\" suggests that the immunomodulatory drugs were used as part of a treatment plan for a specific disease or condition.\n5. \"before bort-dex\" is a misspelling of the drug \"bortezomib,\" which is a cancer medication used to treat certain types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Immunomodulatory drugs (a class of medications used to treat diseases related to the immune system)\n* Autoimmune disorders or inflammatory conditions (diseases that affect the immune system and cause inflammation)\n* Cancer (specifically, multiple myeloma)\n\nI hope this helps!
