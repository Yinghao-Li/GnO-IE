Adverse events: This refers to any harmful or unintended effects of a drug or other chemical substance.\n2. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS): This refers to a group of movement disorders that can be caused by certain medications, including some antipsychotic drugs.\n3. Laboratory values: This refers to the results of medical tests performed in a laboratory, such as blood tests or urine tests, which can provide information about a person's chemical makeup or the presence of certain chemical substances in their body.\n4. Electrocardiograms (ECGs): This refers to a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart, which can provide information about the heart's electrical activity and can detect any abnormalities or imbalances in the heart's rhythm.\n5. Vital signs: This refers to a person's basic physical measurements, such as their temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate, which can provide information about their overall physical health and can detect any abnormalities or changes in their chemical makeup.\n6. Weight change: This refers to a person's weight, which can provide information about their overall health and can detect any changes in their chemical makeup or body composition."},
