To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Animals\" - This is a noun that refers to a group of living organisms, in this case, animals that have been treated with gentamicin.\n2. \"treated\" - This is a verb that indicates the action of administering or applying something to the animals.\n3. \"gentamicin\" - This is a noun that refers to a specific type of antibiotic.\n4. \"can show\" - This is a verb phrase that indicates the possibility or likelihood of something happening.\n5. \"residual areas of interstitial fibrosis\" - This is a noun phrase that refers to the presence of scar tissue in the renal cortex of the animals.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* gentamicin (the antibiotic)\n* interstitial fibrosis (the scar tissue in the renal cortex)"},

Here is the revised list of chemical entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. gentamicin\n\nI have removed the term \"residual areas of interstitial fibrosis\" as it does not refer to a chemical entity.
