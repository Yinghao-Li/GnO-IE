It refers to the damage or abnormality in the cardiomyocytes, which are the muscle cells of the heart.\n2. \"DOX\" is a drug entity. It stands for \"doxorubicin,\" which is a chemotherapy drug that can damage cardiomyocytes and cause heart problems.\n3. \"Control group\" is a disease entity. It refers to the group of animals that did not receive the drug (DOX) and serves as a reference for comparison with the group that received the drug.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Damaged cardiomyocytes\n* DOX (doxorubicin)\n* Control group"},
