GM-mediated nephropathy: This is a specific type of nephropathy that is caused by the action of glomerular mesangial (GM) cells.\n3. Renal cortical renin: This refers to the production of the enzyme renin in the cortex of the kidney.\n4. Endothelin-1: This is a protein that is produced in the body and plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular function.\n\nSo, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
