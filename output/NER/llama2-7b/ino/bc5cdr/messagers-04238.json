Therefore, it is a disease entity.\n2. \"carboplatin\" is also a drug used to treat cancer. Therefore, it is a disease entity.\n3. \"dose-escalation trials\" refers to a type of clinical trial used to determine the safety and efficacy of a new drug or treatment regimen. Therefore, it is not a disease entity.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Paclitaxel\n* Carboplatin"},
