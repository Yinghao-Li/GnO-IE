Neurogenic diabetes insipidus (DI): This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is a rare disorder that affects the brain's ability to regulate water levels in the body.\n2. Traumatic brain injury (TBI): This is the cause of the neurogenic diabetes insipidus mentioned in the paragraph. A traumatic brain injury occurs when the brain is injured due to a sudden and forceful impact, such as in a car accident or fall.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Neurogenic diabetes insipidus (DI)\n2. Traumatic brain injury (TBI)"},
