Leukoencephalopathy: This is a general term that refers to a group of diseases that affect the white matter of the brain. It can cause a range of symptoms including cognitive impairment, seizures, and difficulty with coordination and balance.\n2. Neurocognitive outcomes: This refers to the cognitive functions of the brain, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities.\n3. Neuroradiologic: This term refers to the study of the structure and function of the nervous system using imaging techniques such as MRI or CT scans.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Leukoencephalopathy\n2. Neurocognitive outcomes\n3. Neuroradiologic."},
