It is the active ingredient in the treatment being described.\n2. Epinephrine: This is a chemical substance that is being used as a stimulus in the experiment. It is a hormone that is produced by the adrenal gland and plays a role in the body's \"fight or flight\" response.\n3. Lesions: This is a term that refers to any abnormality or damage in the body. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the ventricular ischemic lesions that are caused by the epinephrine stimulus.\n4. Fibrosis: This is a term that refers to the scarring or hardening of tissue. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the fibrosis that occurs in the ventricles as a result of the epinephrine stimulus.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Clentiazem\n* Epinephrine\n* Lesions (ventricular ischemic lesions)\n* Fibrosis"},
