Cisplatin: This is a chemotherapy drug that is known to cause nephrotoxicity (kidney damage).\n2. Nephrotoxicity: This is a general term that refers to any type of damage to the kidneys.\n3. Creatinine: This is a waste product that is produced by the muscles and is excreted by the kidneys. Elevated levels of serum creatinine in the blood can indicate kidney damage or dysfunction.\n4. Urea: This is another waste product that is produced by the body and excreted by the kidneys. Elevated levels of blood urea can also indicate kidney damage or dysfunction.\n5. Kinin B2 receptor antagonist: This is a medication that is used to treat certain conditions, including kidney disease.\n\nSo, in summary, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are cisplatin, nephrotoxicity, creatinine, urea, and kinin B2 receptor antagonist."},
