To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Experimental hypertension\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a type of high blood pressure that is caused by an experimental intervention (i.e., removing NO).\n2. \"created by the removal of NO\" - This is a disease mechanism, as it describes the specific mechanism by which experimental hypertension is caused (i.e., the removal of nitric oxide).\n3. \"decreased arterial vasodilator activity\" - This is another disease mechanism, as it describes a specific change in the body's physiology that occurs as a result of the removal of nitric oxide (i.e., decreased ability of blood vessels to dilate).\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Experimental hypertension\n* Decreased arterial vasodilator activity\n\nI hope this helps!
