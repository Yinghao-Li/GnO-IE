To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Disease\" entities in the first sentence:\n * \"Dl\" is likely short for \"dilated cardiomyopathy,\" which is a type of heart disease.\n * \"Sotalol\" is a medication used to treat certain heart conditions, including dilated cardiomyopathy.\n2. \"Disease\" entities in the second sentence:\n * \"Azimilide\" is a medication used to treat certain heart conditions, including long QT syndrome, which is a type of heart rhythm disorder.\n * \"TDR\" is likely short for \"torsades de pointes,\" which is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that can occur in certain heart conditions, including long QT syndrome.\n3. \"Disease\" entities in the third sentence:\n * \"Epicardial\" refers to the outer layer of the heart muscle, so \"epicardial APD\" likely refers to the electrical activity of the heart muscle in this layer.\n * \"Markedly\" means \"significantly,\" so the phrase \"causing a diminished TDR\" suggests that the increase in epicardial APD has a significant impact on the heart's electrical activity.\n\nBased on these interpretations, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Dilated cardiomyopathy (Dl)\n* Long QT syndrome (Azimilide)\n* Torsades de pointes (TDR)"},
