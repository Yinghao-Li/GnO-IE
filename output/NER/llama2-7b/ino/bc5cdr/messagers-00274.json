Acquired long QT syndrome: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, referring to a condition where the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is prolonged due to various causes other than genetic mutations.\n2. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: This is a type of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) that is mentioned as a complication of acquired long QT syndrome.\n3. Ventricular tachycardia: This is a type of arrhythmia that occurs when the ventricles of the heart beat abnormally fast.\n4. Intracellular recordings: This refers to the technique used to record the electrical activity within cells, in this case, within the left ventricular wall of the heart.\n\nSo, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Acquired long QT syndrome\n2. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia\n3. Ventricular tachycardia"},
