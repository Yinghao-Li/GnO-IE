Focal cerebral ischemia: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a type of stroke that occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow to a specific area of the brain.\n2. Hypertension: The paragraph mentions the use of phenylephrine to induce hypertension in rats, which is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure.\n3.
