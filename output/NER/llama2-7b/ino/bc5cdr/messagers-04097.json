Tremor: The paragraph specifically mentions \"finger tremor,\" which is a type of involuntary movement of the fingers. Tremor is a common symptom of various neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia.\n2. Displacement-time curve: The paragraph mentions a \"displacement-time curve\" as a method of measuring finger tremor. This curve is a graphical representation of the displacement of a body part over time, which can be used to diagnose and monitor various diseases, including neurological disorders.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Tremor\n2. Neurological disorders"},

Simple amplitude calibration: This is a process of adjusting the amplitude of a signal or measurement to a known standard, and it does not involve any chemical reactions or processes.\n\nTherefore, the only \"Chemical\" entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"displacement - time curve\", which is a mathematical concept rather than a chemical entity itself."},
