HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) - The paragraph mentions the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants, which implies that HIV is one of the diseases being studied.\n2. Crack cocaine use disorder - The paragraph mentions that participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine had an increased risk of HIV seroconversion over time, which suggests that crack cocaine use disorder may be a disease entity in this context.\n\nNote that these are the only two disease entities explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. Other entities mentioned, such as \"potential confounders,\" are not disease entities but rather factors that may influence the relationship between the disease entities and the outcome of interest."},
