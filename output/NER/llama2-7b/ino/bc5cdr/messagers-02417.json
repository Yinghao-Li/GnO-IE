PR stands for \"partial response,\" which refers to a type of response that is not complete but still indicates some level of effectiveness. In the context of the paragraph, it represents a type of response that is less than complete.\n2. CR stands for \"complete response,\" which refers to a type of response that indicates a full or complete effectiveness of a treatment or intervention. In the context of the paragraph, it represents a type of response that is complete and effective.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities identified in the paragraph are PR and CR."},
