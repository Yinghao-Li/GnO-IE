Disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a condition that affects the white matter of the brain and causes necrosis (death) of brain tissue.\n2. Leukoencephalopathy: This is a broader term that refers to any disease that affects the white matter of the brain.\n3. Necrotizing: This term refers to the death of brain tissue, which is a common feature of many neurological disorders.\n4. Contrast enhancement: This refers to the use of a contrast agent during imaging to highlight areas of the brain that are affected by the disease. In the context of the paragraph, the contrast enhancement of the white matter is a characteristic feature of the disease.\n\nSo, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"Disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy with characteristic contrast enhancement of the white matter.\""},
