Oxidative stress: This is a condition in which there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Oxidative stress can lead to cellular damage and increase the risk of various diseases, including cancer.\n2. Cardiotoxicity: This refers to the damage caused to the heart muscle as a result of exposure to certain drugs, radiation, or other toxic substances. Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug that can cause cardiotoxicity, leading to damage to the heart muscle and potentially leading to heart failure.\n3. Cancer: Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. The paragraph mentions the potential for doxorubicin to cause cardiotoxicity after treatment with single and multiple doses, which suggests that the drug may be effective in treating cancer but also has the potential to cause harm to the heart."},
