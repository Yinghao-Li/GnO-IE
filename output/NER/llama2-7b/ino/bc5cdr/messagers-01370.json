Quinine: Quinine is a chemical compound that is an alkaloid found in the bark of the cinchona tree. It has anti-arrhythmic properties, meaning it can help regulate abnormal heart rhythms.\n2. Quinidine: Quinidine is another chemical compound that is also an alkaloid found in the cinchona tree. Like quinine, it has anti-arrhythmic properties, but it can also have pro-arrhythmic effects, meaning it can cause abnormal heart rhythms.\n3. Chincona: Chincona is not a specific chemical entity, but rather a class of chemical compounds that are related to quinine and quinidine. These compounds are also found in the cinchona tree and have similar properties to quinine and quinidine."},
