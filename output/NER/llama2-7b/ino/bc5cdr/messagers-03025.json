Renal (related to the kidneys)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Vision: The loss of vision is a chemical entity as it is a result of a chemical change in the eye, which can be caused by various factors such as damage to the retina or optic nerve.\n2. Hearing: The loss of hearing is also a chemical entity as it can be caused by damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve, which are responsible for hearing.\n3. Renal: Renal refers to the kidneys, which are organs that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. End-stage renal disease is a condition where the kidneys are no longer able to function properly, leading to a buildup of waste in the body.\n\nTherefore, the three chemical entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Vision\n2. Hearing\n3. Renal"},
