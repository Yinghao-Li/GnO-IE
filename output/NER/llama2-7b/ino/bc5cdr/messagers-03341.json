It refers to a severe and prolonged seizure that can lead to brain damage or death if not treated promptly.\n2. Epilepsy: This is a broader term that refers to a group of neurological disorders characterized by recurrent seizures. The paragraph specifically mentions \"status epilepticus,\" which is a severe form of epilepsy.\n3. Seizures: This is a more general term that refers to abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, including convulsions, confusion, and loss of consciousness.

It is a pharmacological tool used to block N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and learning.\n2. Lithium: This is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 5. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal that is commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.\n3. Pilocarpine: This is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C14H12N2O5. It is a cholinergic agonist that is used to treat glaucoma and other eye disorders.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* MK-801 (a drug)\n* Lithium (an element)\n* Pilocarpine (a drug)"},
