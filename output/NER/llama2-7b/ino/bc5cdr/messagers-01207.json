Rat disease: The paragraph mentions that rats were treated with a drug to study the effects of the disease.\n2. Neurodegenerative disease: The drug used in the study, LNNA, is a NO synthase inhibitor, which suggests that the disease being studied may be related to neurodegeneration.\n3. Neuroinflammation: The use of LNNA as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases often involves reducing inflammation in the brain, which suggests that the disease being studied may involve neuroinflammation.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
