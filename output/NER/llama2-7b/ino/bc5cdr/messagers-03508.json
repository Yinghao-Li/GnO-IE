It is not a disease itself, but it can be used to deliver drugs to treat various diseases.\n2. NaOH (Sodium hydroxide): This entity is a strong base that is often used in the production of pharmaceuticals, including drugs that are used to treat diseases. It is not a disease itself, but it can be used in the manufacturing process of drugs that are intended to treat diseases.\n\nTherefore, the two entities in the paragraph that are related to diseases are:\n\n1.
