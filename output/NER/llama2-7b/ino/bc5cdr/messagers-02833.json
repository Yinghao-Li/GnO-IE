Glucocorticoid activity\n\nExplanation: Glucocorticoid activity is a disease or a condition that is associated with the use of glucocorticoids, which are steroid hormones that are used to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammation, asthma, and autoimmune disorders.\n\n2. Thymus weight\n\nExplanation: Thymus weight is a measure of the size or mass of the thymus gland, which is a part of the immune system located in the chest. An abnormal increase in thymus weight can be a sign of certain diseases or conditions, such as myasthenia gravis, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerve-muscle connection."},
