Gentamicin-induced nephropathy: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to the kidney damage caused by the antibiotic gentamicin.\n2. Nephropathy: This is a broader term that refers to any type of kidney damage or disease.\n3. Decreased expression of Na ( + ) / K ( + ) - ATPase: This is a specific molecular entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to the decreased expression of the sodium/potassium ATPase enzyme in the kidneys.\n4. NHE3: This is another specific molecular entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 enzyme.\n5. NBC1: This is a specific molecular entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter 1 enzyme.\n6. AQP1: This is a specific molecular entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to the aquaporin 1 water channel protein.\n7. OAT: This is a specific molecular entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to the organic anion transport protein.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
