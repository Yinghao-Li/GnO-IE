HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol): A type of cholesterol that is found in the blood and plays a role in removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transporting it to the liver for excretion. Low levels of HDL-C have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.\n2. Apo A-I (Apolipoprotein A-I): A protein that is found in the blood and plays a role in the transportation of triglycerides and cholesterol in the bloodstream. Low levels of Apo A-I have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.\n3. Apo A-II (Apolipoprotein A-II): A protein that is found in the blood and plays a role in the transportation of triglycerides and cholesterol in the bloodstream. Low levels of Apo A-II have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.\n4. VLDL (Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein): A type of lipoprotein that is found in the blood and contains a high amount of triglycerides. Elevated levels of VLDL in the bloodstream have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease."},
