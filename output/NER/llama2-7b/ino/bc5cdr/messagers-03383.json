It refers to the thickening and hardening of the glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n2. Renal AT2R: This stands for renal angiotensin type 2 receptor. It is a protein that is found on the surface of kidney cells and plays a role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance in the body.\n3. Caffeine: This is the substance that is mentioned as causing the developmental origin of glomerulosclerosis in the paragraph. Caffeine is a stimulant that can cross the placenta and reach the developing fetus during pregnancy, potentially leading to changes in the developing kidneys.\n\nSo, in summary, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are glomerulosclerosis and renal AT2R."},

Low functional programming: This refers to the reduced or impaired function of a system, in this case, the renal AT2R (angiotensin type 2 receptor).\n2. Renal AT2R: This is a specific type of receptor found in the kidneys that is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance.\n3. Glomerulosclerosis: This is a condition where the glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, become scarred and hardened, leading to kidney damage.\n4. Caffeine: This is a chemical substance that is mentioned in the paragraph as the inducer of glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Low functional programming\n* Renal AT2R\n* Glomerulosclerosis\n* Caffeine"},
