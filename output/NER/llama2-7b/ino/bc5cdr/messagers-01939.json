Cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia: This is a condition where the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood due to the use of cocaine.\n2. Coronary vasoconstriction: This is the narrowing of the coronary arteries, which can reduce blood flow to the heart muscle and cause myocardial ischemia.\n3. Chest pain: This is a symptom of myocardial ischemia or other cardiovascular conditions.\n4. Non-ischemic ECG: This refers to an electrocardiogram (ECG) that does not show signs of myocardial ischemia or infarction (heart attack).\n5. TIMI risk score: This is a score used to assess the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attack or stroke, in patients with acute coronary syndrome.\n6. 30-day adverse events: This refers to any negative cardiovascular events that occur within 30 days of a patient's initial presentation to the emergency department."},
