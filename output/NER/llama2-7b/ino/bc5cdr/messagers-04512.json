Apomorphine: Apomorphine is a drug that is used to induce amnesia in animals. It works by blocking the action of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain, which can lead to memory impairment.\n2. Amnesia: Amnesia is a condition characterized by the inability to remember past events or experiences. It can be caused by various factors, including drugs like apomorphine.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Apomorphine\n2. Amnesia"},
