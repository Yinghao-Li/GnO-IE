The term \"rater\" is a common term used in scientific research to refer to the individuals who are responsible for scoring or evaluating a particular variable or outcome."},

The term \"neuropsychiatric\" refers to a branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the nervous system, including those that affect mood, thought, and behavior. The term \"like behavior\" suggests that the neuropsychiatric-like behavior being evaluated is similar to that found in neuropsychiatric disorders."},
