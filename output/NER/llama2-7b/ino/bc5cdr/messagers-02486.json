Kidney disease: The paragraph mentions \"kidney involvement,\" which could refer to any disease or disorder that affects the kidneys.\n2. Nephropathy: This term refers to kidney damage or disease, and it could be the specific disease entity being referred to in the paragraph.\n3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): This is a broader term that refers to the gradual loss of kidney function over time, which can lead to kidney failure.\n4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): This is a sudden and temporary loss of kidney function, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, injury, or medication.\n\nTherefore, the potential disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
