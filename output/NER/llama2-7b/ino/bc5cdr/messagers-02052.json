CCR2: This is a chemokine receptor protein that is mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. CCL2: This is a chemokine protein that interacts with CCR2.\n3. Monocyte infiltration: This refers to the movement of monocytes (a type of white blood cell) into the brain, which is a common feature of many neurological disorders.\n4. Neuroinflammatory cascade: This is a complex series of events involving inflammation in the brain, which can be triggered by various factors and can lead to various neurological disorders.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Monocyte infiltration (a symptom of various neurological disorders)\n2. Neuroinflammatory cascade (a complex series of events involving inflammation in the brain)\n\nI hope this helps!
