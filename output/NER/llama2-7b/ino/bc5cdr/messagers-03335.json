To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Maleate\" is a disease entity because it is a toxic compound that can cause cell damage and disrupt cellular processes.\n2. \"Cell damage\" is a disease entity because it refers to any type of harm or injury to cells, which can lead to various diseases and disorders.\n3. \"Reactive oxygen species (ROS)\" is a disease entity because it is a type of free radical that can cause oxidative stress and damage to cells and tissues, leading to various diseases and disorders.\n4. \"LLC - PK1 cells\" is a disease entity because it refers to a specific type of cell culture that is commonly used in scientific research to study cellular processes and diseases.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Maleate\n* Cell damage\n* Reactive oxygen species (ROS)\n* LLC - PK1 cells"},
