Parkinson's disease (PD): This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.\n2. MPTP (methyl-p-tyrosine): This is a toxic compound that is used in the marmoset model of Parkinson's disease. MPTP is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is involved in the production of dopamine in the brain. Administration of MPTP to marmosets leads to a model of Parkinson's disease that mimics many of the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in humans."},
