Epilepsy: The paragraph mentions \"seizures\" produced by pilocarpine, which is a drug used to induce seizures in animals. This implies that the study is investigating the effects of isoniazid on a disease called epilepsy.\n2. Isoniazid: The paragraph mentions \"intrastriatal injections of isoniazid\", which suggests that the study is investigating the effects of this drug on the brain. Isoniazid is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat tuberculosis, but it has also been shown to have neuroprotective effects.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are epilepsy and isoniazid."},
