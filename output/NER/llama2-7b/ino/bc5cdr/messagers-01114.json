Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) - This is a specific enzyme that is found in the liver and is often measured as part of a liver function test. An elevated level of GGT in the blood can be indicative of liver damage or disease.\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"Liver disease\" or \"Liver dysfunction\", as it is mentioned that only one of the 446 liver function tests (0.02%) was greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit, which suggests that there is an abnormality in the liver function."},
