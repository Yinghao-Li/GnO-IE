Bipolar disorder: The paragraph mentions \"bipolar mania,\" which is a mood disorder characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania, often alternating with episodes of depression.\n2. Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that affects mood, causing extreme mood swings that can range from manic highs to depressive lows.\n3. Na ( + ) / K ( + ) - ATPase inhibitor: This is a type of drug that inhibits the activity of a specific enzyme in the body, which is involved in maintaining the balance of sodium and potassium ions in cells.\n4. Ouabain: This is the name of the specific Na ( + ) / K ( + ) - ATPase inhibitor mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Bipolar disorder\n2. Bipolar mania\n3. Na ( + ) / K ( + ) - ATPase inhibitor (specifically, ouabain)"},

Ouabain: Ouabain is a chemical compound that is an inhibitor of the Na+/K+-ATPase enzyme. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the substance that is administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) to rats.\n2. Na+/K+-ATPase: This is the enzyme that is inhibited by ouabain. It is responsible for maintaining the concentration gradients of sodium and potassium ions across cell membranes.\n3. ATPase: ATPase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to produce energy for various cellular processes. In this context, Na+/K+-ATPase is a specific type of ATPase that is involved in ion transport.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are ouabain, Na+/K+-ATPase, and ATPase."},
