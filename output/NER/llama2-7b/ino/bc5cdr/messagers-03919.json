Doses: This refers to the amount of a substance being measured or studied. In this context, the doses of the substance being referred to are the amounts that cause loss of consciousness or convulsions in rats and cats.\n2. Substance: This refers to the chemical substance being studied or measured. In this context, the substance is the substance that causes central excitation or depression in rats and cats.\n3. Central excitation: This refers to the effect of the substance on the central nervous system, specifically the brain and spinal cord. In this context, central excitation means that the substance causes an increase in activity or stimulation in the central nervous system.\n4. Central depression: This refers to the effect of the substance on the central nervous system, specifically the brain and spinal cord. In this context, central depression means that the substance causes a decrease in activity or inhibition in the central nervous system.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Doses\n* Substance\n* Central excitation\n* Central depression"},
