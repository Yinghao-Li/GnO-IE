Hypertension (high blood pressure)\n2. Angina (chest pain)\n3. Heart failure\n4. Migraine\n5.

To identify the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Additional members of this group\" - This refers to a group of chemical entities, which are likely to be calcium channel blockers.\n2. \"Calcium channel blockers\" - This is a class of chemical entities that are known to block the flow of calcium ions through calcium channels in the body. Examples of calcium channel blockers include verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine.\n3. \"for a variety of indications\" - This refers to the different uses or applications of calcium channel blockers.\n4. \"for which they may offer advantages over current therapy\" - This suggests that the calcium channel blockers being studied may have potential benefits over existing treatments for certain conditions.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Calcium channel blockers (a class of chemical entities)\n* Verapamil\n* Diltiazem\n* Nifedipine (specific examples of calcium channel blockers)"},
