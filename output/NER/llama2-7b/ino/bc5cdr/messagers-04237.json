It refers to a disease of the muscles.\n2. Myopathy: This is a broader term that refers to any disease of the muscles. The term \"myopathic disease\" is used in the paragraph to specify that the disease being studied is a specific type of myopathy.\n3. Virility: This refers to male fertility or sexual potency. The authors mention that high doses of anabolizing steroids cannot be continuously administered because of their effects on virility.\n4. Dystrophic injurious agent: This refers to the agent or factor that causes muscle tissue injury. The authors suggest that the dystrophic injurious agent is not a lack of vitamin E, but something else that is not yet understood.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myopathic disease\n2. Myopathy\n3. Virility\n4. Dystrophic injurious agent"},
