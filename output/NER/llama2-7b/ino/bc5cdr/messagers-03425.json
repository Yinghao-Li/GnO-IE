Disease: \"early-life exposure\"\n\nIn the paragraph, the author suggests that future research should focus on studying the mechanisms of disease through animal studies and population-based studies that integrate early-life exposure, molecular alterations, and latent disease outcomes.\n\nSo, \"latent disease outcomes\" refers to the long-term effects of a disease that may not be immediately apparent, but can manifest later in life. \"Molecular alterations\" refers to changes at the molecular level that can contribute to the development of disease. \"Early-life exposure\" refers to exposure to factors that can increase the risk of developing disease, often in early childhood or fetal development."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Exposure\n2. Molecular alterations\n3. Latent disease outcomes\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Exposure refers to the introduction of a chemical substance or agent into the body, which can have a biological effect.\n2. Molecular alterations refer to changes in the chemical structure of molecules within the body, which can be caused by exposure to chemicals.\n3. Latent disease outcomes refer to the long-term effects of chemical exposure on the body, which may not become apparent until after a period of time has passed.\n\nI hope this helps!
