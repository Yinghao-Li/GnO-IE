Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Postoperatively\n * seizures\n * Group T\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Postoperatively: surgery, time after surgery\n * seizures: seizure, epilepsy\n * Group T: Group, T\n3. Check if any of the nouns are disease entities:\n * Yes, \"seizures\" is a disease entity, specifically epilepsy.\n4. Check if any of the noun phrases are disease entities:\n * Yes, \"Group T\" is a disease entity, specifically a specific group of patients (e.g., a clinical trial group).\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"seizures\" (epilepsy) and \"Group T\"."},
