Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Inulin\n * rhIGF-I\n * PAN nephropathy\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Inulin: clearance\n * rhIGF-I: treatment\n * PAN nephropathy: disease\n3. Identify the adjectives modifying the nouns:\n * clearance: higher\n * treatment: rhIGF-I\n * disease: PAN nephropathy\n4. Identify the prepositional phrases in the paragraph:\n * in\n * of\n5. Identify the verb phrases in the paragraph:\n * was higher\n * was p < 0.05\n6. Identify the entities in the paragraph:\n * Disease: PAN nephropathy\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"PAN nephropathy\"."},
