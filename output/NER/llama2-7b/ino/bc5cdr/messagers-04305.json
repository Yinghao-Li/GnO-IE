Sumatriptan: This is a chemical drug that is administered subcutaneously to the patient. It is a serotonin receptor agonist used to treat migraines and cluster headaches.\n2. Serotonin: This is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the transmission of pain signals in the body. Sumatriptan works by activating serotonin receptors in the brain, which helps to relieve the pain associated with migraines and cluster headaches.\n3.
