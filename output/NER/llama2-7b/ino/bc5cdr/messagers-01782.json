Endoscopic sinus surgery - This is a surgical procedure used to treat various diseases and disorders of the sinuses, such as chronic sinusitis, nasal polyps, and skull base tumors.\n2. Chronic sinusitis - This is a common condition characterized by inflammation and infection of the sinuses, which can cause symptoms such as nasal congestion, headaches, and facial pain.\n3. Nasal polyps - These are non-cancerous growths that can occur in the nasal passages and can cause breathing difficulties, nasal congestion, and other symptoms.\n4. Skull base tumors - These are abnormal growths that can occur in the skull base, which is the area at the base of the brain and spinal cord. These tumors can cause a variety of symptoms, including headaches, facial pain, and difficulty swallowing.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},

Anesthesia: This is a general term for a state of being unconscious and insensible to pain.\n2. Endotracheal tube: This is a medical device used to establish and maintain a patent airway during anesthesia. It is inserted through the mouth or nose and advanced into the trachea to provide a secure airway.\n3. Laryngeal mask: This is a device used to establish a secure airway during anesthesia. It is placed over the laryngeal inlet and provides a seal around the larynx to prevent air from leaking around the edges.\n4. Sinus: This refers to the paranasal sinuses, which are air-filled cavities within the skull that are connected to the nasal passages.\n5. Surgery: This is a general term for medical procedures that involve the use of manual or instrumental techniques to repair or remove damaged or diseased tissue.\n\nI hope this helps!
