However, based on the context, we can identify the following potential \"disease\" entities:\n\n1. Bradycardia: Bradycardia is a heart condition characterized by a slow heart rate, typically below 60 beats per minute. It can be caused by various factors, including medications like bepridil.\n2. Bepridil: Bepridil is a medication that is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing blood flow to the heart.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are bradycardia and bepridil."},
