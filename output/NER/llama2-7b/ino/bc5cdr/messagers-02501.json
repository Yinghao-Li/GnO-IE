Incidence - This is a chemical entity because it refers to the rate or frequency of something happening, which is a quantitative chemical property.\n2. Delirium - This is a chemical entity because it is a medical condition characterized by a disturbance in consciousness, cognition, and perception, which can be caused by various chemical substances.\n3. Models - These are not chemical entities in the classical sense, but they can be considered as abstract chemical entities in the context of the paragraph. A model is a conceptual framework used to describe and analyze a system, in this case, the relationship between risk factors and delirium incidence.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
