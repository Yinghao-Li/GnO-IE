Unwanted effect: This is not a specific disease entity, but rather a general term used to describe an undesirable outcome or side effect of a treatment.\n2. Hepatic histology: This refers to the study of the structure of the liver, including its tissues and cells. Hepatic histology can be affected by various diseases or conditions, such as liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.\n3.
