To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"CML\" refers to:\n * Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)\n2. \"ionizing radiation\" refers to:\n * Ionizing radiation is a type of radiation that has enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, resulting in the formation of ions. Examples of ionizing radiation include X-rays, gamma rays, and alpha particles.\n3. \"chemical exposures\" refers to:\n * Exposure to chemicals or toxins that can cause harm to the body.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)\n2. Ionizing radiation\n3. Chemical exposures"},
