To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"TdP\" is an abbreviation for:\n * TdP = Torsades de Pointes (a type of cardiac arrhythmia)\n2. \"hypokalemia\" refers to:\n * Hypokalemia = low potassium levels in the blood\n3. \"digoxin excess\" refers to:\n * Digoxin = a medication used to treat heart failure and atrial fibrillation\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Torsades de Pointes (TdP)\n* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)\n* Digoxin excess (excessive use of the medication digoxin)"},
