Serum: This is a chemical substance that contains proteins and other molecules that are present in the blood. In the context of the paragraph, serum is used to measure the concentration of levetiracetam in the blood.\n3. Concentrations: This is a chemical term that refers to the amount of a substance present in a given volume of a solution. In the paragraph, concentrations of levetiracetam in the blood are measured before and after drug administration.\n4. Half-life: This is a chemical term that refers to the time it takes for the concentration of a substance in the body to decrease by half. In the paragraph, the elimination half-life of levetiracetam is calculated.\n\nTherefore, the three chemical entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Levetiracetam\n2. Serum\n3. Half-life"},
