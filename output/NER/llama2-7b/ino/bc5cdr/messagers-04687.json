Dobutamine: This is a medication that is used to stimulate the heart and increase heart rate during stress echocardiography. It is a beta-agonist, which means it works by mimicking the action of the hormone adrenaline (epinephrine) on the heart.\n2. Heart: This is the organ that is being studied during the stress echocardiography procedure.\n3. Echocardiography: This is the imaging technique used to visualize the heart and its structures during the procedure. It uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the heart.\n4. Stress: This refers to the physical or mental stimulus that is being used to test the heart's function during the procedure. In this case, the stress is provided by the medication dobutamine.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
