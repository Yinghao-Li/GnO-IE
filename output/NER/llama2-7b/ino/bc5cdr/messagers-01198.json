Methadone dose: This refers to the amount of methadone a person is taking, which can affect the QTc interval.\n2. Cytochrome P-450 3A4 drug-drug interactions: This refers to the interactions between methadone and other drugs that are metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 3A4 enzyme, which can affect the QTc interval.\n3. Hypokalemia: This refers to a low level of potassium in the blood, which can also affect the QTc interval.\n4. Altered liver function: This refers to any abnormality in the functioning of the liver, which can also affect the QTc interval.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are methadone dose, cytochrome P-450 3A4 drug-drug interactions, hypokalemia, and altered liver function."},
