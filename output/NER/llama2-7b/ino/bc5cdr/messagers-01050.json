Anxiety responses\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Pharmacological interactions: This refers to the study of the effects of drugs or other chemical substances on living organisms, including their interactions with biological systems. In this context, \"pharmacological interactions\" is a chemical entity because it refers to the study of the interactions between drugs and the body at a molecular level.\n2. Anxiety responses: Anxiety is a psychological and physiological state characterized by feelings of worry, nervousness, and fear. In this context, \"anxiety responses\" refers to the physical and psychological changes that occur in the body in response to anxiety-inducing stimuli. Anxiety responses are a chemical entity because they involve changes in the body's chemical balance, including the release of neurotransmitters and hormones that regulate mood and behavior."},
