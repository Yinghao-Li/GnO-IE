Lithium therapy: Lithium is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions. It can have side effects, including the development of hyperparathyroidism.\n2. Hyperparathyroidism: Hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to an imbalance in calcium levels in the body. This can cause a range of symptoms, including bone pain, fatigue, and kidney stones."},
