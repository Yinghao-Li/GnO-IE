Myocardial infarction (MI): This is a type of heart attack caused by the blockage of a coronary artery, leading to damage or death of heart muscle cells.\n2. Inflammation: Inflammation is a natural response of the body's immune system to injury or infection, but in the context of myocardial infarction, it can cause further damage to the heart muscle.\n3. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK): AMPK is an enzyme that plays a key role in regulating energy metabolism and cellular stress responses. It is activated in response to changes in energy levels or cellular stress, and can help to protect against cellular damage.\n\nSo, in summary, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are myocardial infarction, inflammation, and AMPK."},
