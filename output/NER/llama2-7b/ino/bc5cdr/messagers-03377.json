Fine particulate matter (PM)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Ozone (O3): Ozone is a chemical gas that is formed when nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in the presence of sunlight. It is a common air pollutant that can have harmful effects on human health, including respiratory problems and aggravation of existing conditions like asthma.\n2. Fine particulate matter (PM): PM refers to small particles that are suspended in the air, with diameters of 10 micrometers or less. These particles can come from a variety of sources, including industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and wildfires. Exposure to PM has been linked to a range of health problems, including respiratory issues, cardiovascular disease, and even premature death."},
