Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is \"uncontrollable muscle movements\" that persist after complete recovery of consciousness.\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Patients\n * Muscle movements\n * Consciousness\n3. Determine whether each entity is a disease or not:\n * Patients: Not a disease, but rather the individuals affected by the uncontrollable muscle movements.\n * Muscle movements: Not a disease, but rather a physical phenomenon that occurs in the body.\n * Consciousness: Not a disease, but rather a state of awareness or alertness.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"uncontrollable muscle movements\"."},
