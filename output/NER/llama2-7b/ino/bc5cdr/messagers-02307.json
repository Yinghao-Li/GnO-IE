Scleroderma: This is a type of connective tissue disease that can cause hardening and thickening of the skin and organs.\n2.

Renal crisis: This refers to a sudden and severe kidney failure that can occur in people with scleroderma or systemic sclerosis.\n4. Temporary renal replacement therapy: This refers to a temporary treatment where a machine takes over the function of the kidneys to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n5. Permanent renal replacement therapy: This refers to a more permanent treatment where a kidney transplant is performed to replace the damaged or failed kidneys.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Scleroderma (a disease)\n* Systemic sclerosis (a disease)\n* Renal crisis (a complication of scleroderma or systemic sclerosis)\n* Temporary renal replacement therapy (a treatment for renal crisis)\n* Permanent renal replacement therapy (a treatment for renal crisis)"},
