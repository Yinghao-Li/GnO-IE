Glial activation: Glial cells are non-neuronal cells in the brain that provide support and maintenance functions for neurons. Activation of glial cells can have a significant impact on neuronal function and behavior.\n2. Post-synaptic neurotoxicity: This refers to damage to neurons after synaptic transmission has occurred. Post-synaptic neurotoxicity can result from various factors, including exposure to toxins, infection, or injury.\n3. Memory impairment: The paragraph specifically mentions memory impairment in rats, which is a common indicator of neurological disorders.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Glial activation\n2. Post-synaptic neurotoxicity\n3. Memory impairment"},
