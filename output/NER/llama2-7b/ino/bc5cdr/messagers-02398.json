Behavioral phenotypes: This refers to the observable behaviors or patterns of behavior that are associated with a particular disease or condition. In this context, the study is investigating how exposure to BPA during puberty affects the behavior of male mice.\n2. AChE activity: AChE stands for acetylcholinesterase, which is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the nervous system. In this context, \"AChE activity\" refers to the level of activity of this enzyme in the brain or other tissues. The study is measuring the activity of AChE in male mice exposed to BPA during puberty.\n\nSo, in summary, the two \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Behavioral phenotypes\n2. AChE activity"},
