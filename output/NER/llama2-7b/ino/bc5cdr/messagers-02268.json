Lindane (also known as gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Nitric oxide (NO) is a chemical compound that is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and immune response. In the context of the paragraph, nitric oxide is mentioned as the chemical that plays a role in convulsions induced by lindane in rats.\n2. Lindane is a chemical compound that is used as an insecticide and acaricide. It is a synthetic hexachlorocyclohexane that can cause convulsions and other neurological effects in animals, including rats.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
