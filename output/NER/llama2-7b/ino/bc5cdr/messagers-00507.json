Hypertension: High blood pressure is a disease that can be caused by various factors, including the use of adrenaline.\n2. Brain damage: The destruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can lead to brain damage, which can have serious consequences.\n3. Stroke: The breakdown of the BBB can increase the risk of stroke, which occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted.\n4. Brain slices: The use of brain slices in the study of BBB damage suggests that the researchers are investigating the effects of adrenaline on the brain tissue.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are hypertension, brain damage, stroke, and brain slices."},
