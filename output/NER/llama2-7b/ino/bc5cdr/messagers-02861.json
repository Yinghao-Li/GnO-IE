Ecstasy: A psychoactive drug that can alter brain function and lead to long-term cognitive impairments.\n2. Dysfunction: Abnormal or impaired functioning of a system or structure in the brain, which can be caused by various factors including drug use.\n3. Fronto-temporal circuitry: A network of brain regions involved in attention, memory, and other cognitive processes, including the frontal and temporal lobes.\n4. Memory impairments: Impairments in the ability to form, store, and retrieve memories, which can be caused by various factors including drug use.\n5.
