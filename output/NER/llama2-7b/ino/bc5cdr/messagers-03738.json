It is a physiological parameter that can be measured in terms of the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the heart.\n2. VIP (Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide): This is a hormone that is produced in the intestine and plays a role in regulating various physiological processes, including the secretion of digestive enzymes and the contraction of smooth muscle.
