Bile salt pool composition: This is a term used to describe the mixture of bile salts present in the body.\n3. Synthesis of individual BS in vivo: This refers to the process of producing individual bile salts within the body.\n4. Hepatic activities: This term refers to the functions or activities of the liver.\n5. Expression levels of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A): This refers to the level of an enzyme called cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase in the body.\n6. Sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27): This is another enzyme involved in bile salt synthesis.\n7. Other enzymes involved in BS synthesis: This refers to other enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of bile salts.\n\nSo, the entities mentioned in the paragraph are related to the study of bile salt synthesis and liver function, but none of them are diseases."},
