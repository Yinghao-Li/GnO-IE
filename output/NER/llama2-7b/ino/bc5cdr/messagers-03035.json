Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * DHEA\n * amphetamine\n * locomotion\n2. Identify the nouns in the noun phrases:\n * DHEA (noun)\n * amphetamine (noun)\n * locomotion (noun)\n3. Check if any of the nouns are related to diseases:\n * DHEA is not related to any disease.\n * Amphetamine is a drug that can be used to treat certain medical conditions, such as narcolepsy, but it is not a disease in itself.\n * Locomotion is not a disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},
