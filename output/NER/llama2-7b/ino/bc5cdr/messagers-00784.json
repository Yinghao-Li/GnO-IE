Hypoxic cortical laminar necrosis: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a type of brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen.\n2. Hemolytic anemia: This is the underlying disease that led to the hypoxic cortical laminar necrosis. Hemolytic anemia is a condition where red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced, leading to anemia.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypoxic cortical laminar necrosis\n2. Hemolytic anemia"},

Hemolytic anemia - a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced, leading to anemia.\n2. Hypoxic - refers to a lack of oxygen supply to the body's tissues.\n3.

Necrosis - refers to the death of cells or tissues due to injury or disease.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells)\n2.
