To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"infections\": This is a broad term that encompasses any type of infection, including bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections.\n2. \"nonviral infections\": This term specifically refers to infections that are not caused by viruses.\n3. \"Aza\": This is an abbreviation for the drug \"azathioprine\", which is a medication used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and organ transplant rejection.\n4. \"cyclosporine\": This is an abbreviation for the drug \"cyclosporine\", which is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent rejection in organ transplant patients.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Infections (broad term)\n* Nonviral infections\n* Autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease)\n* Organ transplant rejection\n\nI hope this helps!
