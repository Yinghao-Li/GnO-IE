Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Disappearance of seizures\n * Normalization of abnormal EEG\n * Disappearance of seizures\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Disappearance (noun)\n * seizures (noun)\n * EEG (noun)\n3. Determine if each noun is a disease entity:\n * Disappearance (not a disease entity)\n * seizures (yes, a disease entity)\n * EEG (not a disease entity)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"seizures\"."},
