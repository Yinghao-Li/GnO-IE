Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motivation, pleasure, and reward processing.\n3. Nigrostriatal: This term refers to the nigrostriatal pathway, which is a pathway in the brain that involves the transmission of dopamine signals from the substantia nigra to the striatum. The nigrostriatal pathway is involved in the regulation of movement and reward processing.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Trazodone\n* DA (dopamine)\n* Nigrostriatal (referring to the nigrostriatal pathway)"},
