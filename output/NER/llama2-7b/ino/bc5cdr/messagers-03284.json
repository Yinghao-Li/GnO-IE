BCHE: beta-chain of the acetylcholine receptor (BCHE variant c.695T > A, p. Val204Asp)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Suxamethonium: Suxamethonium is a neuromuscular blocking drug that works by blocking the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle paralysis. It is commonly used for muscle relaxation during surgery.\n2. BCHE: BCHE stands for beta-chain of the acetylcholine receptor. The variant c.695T > A, p. Val204Asp refers to a specific mutation in the BCHE gene that results in the substitution of the amino acid valine (Val) at position 204 with aspirin (Asp). This mutation can lead to changes in the function of the acetylcholine receptor and may affect the transmission of nerve impulses."},
