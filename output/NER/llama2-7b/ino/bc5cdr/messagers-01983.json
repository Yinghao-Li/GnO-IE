HIV/AIDS: The paragraph mentions that in 1999, there were 30 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, which is a disease that attacks the body's immune system and makes it difficult to fight off infections and diseases.\n2. Malaria: The paragraph states that malaria was the second leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa in 1999, which is a disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito.\n3. Tuberculosis (TB): The paragraph mentions that TB was the leading cause of death from a single infectious disease in 1999, which is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body."},

Periodic Table: The paragraph mentions the year 1999, which is a specific year in the periodic table of elements.\n2. Elements: The paragraph mentions the elements of the periodic table, such as \"30\" (which refers to the element scandium) and \"1999\" (which refers to the year in which the element was discovered or first isolated).\n3. Isotopes: The paragraph does not explicitly mention isotopes, but the concept of isotopes is closely related to the study of chemical elements and their properties.\n4. Chemical Reactions: The paragraph does not explicitly mention chemical reactions, but the study of chemical reactions is a fundamental aspect of chemistry.\n5. Chemical Bonding: The paragraph does not explicitly mention chemical bonding, but the study of chemical bonding is a fundamental aspect of chemistry.\n6. Molecules: The paragraph does not explicitly mention molecules, but the study of molecules is a fundamental aspect of chemistry.\n7.
