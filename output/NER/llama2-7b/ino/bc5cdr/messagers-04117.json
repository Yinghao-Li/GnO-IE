Acute cholecystitis: This is a condition where the gallbladder becomes inflamed suddenly, often causing severe abdominal pain.\n2. Hepatic insufficiency syndrome: This is a condition where the liver is not functioning properly, leading to a buildup of toxins in the body and impairing the body's ability to function properly.\n3. Renal tubular acidosis: This is a condition where the kidneys are unable to properly filter waste products from the blood, leading to an accumulation of acid in the blood.\n\nSo, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Acute cholecystitis\n2. Hepatic insufficiency syndrome\n3. Renal tubular acidosis"},
