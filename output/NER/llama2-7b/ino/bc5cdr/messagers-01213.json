Tempol (a superoxide scavenger)\nb. Arterial pressure\nc. LNNA (a rat strain)\n\n2. Determine whether each entity is a disease or a symptom:\n\na. Tempol: Not a disease, but a drug or treatment.\nb. Arterial pressure: A physiological measurement, not a disease.\nc. LNNA: A rat strain, not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\na. None.\n\nThe paragraph only mentions physiological measurements and a drug treatment, without mentioning any diseases or symptoms."},

NO: This is another abbreviation for nitric oxide, which is a signaling molecule that is involved in various physiological processes.\n5.
