Pericellular: This is an adjective used to describe the location of something near a cell.\n3. p75 (NTR): This is a protein, specifically a transmembrane protein called p75 (NTR), which is involved in various cellular processes.\n4. IR: This is an abbreviation for \"immunoreactivity,\" which refers to the ability of a protein to react with an antibody or other detection method.\n5. GFAP: This is an abbreviation for \"glial fibrillary acidic protein,\" which is a protein that is specifically expressed in glial cells in the nervous system.\n6. Glial: This is an adjective used to describe cells that provide support and maintenance functions for neurons, such as glia.\n\nSo, the only entity in the paragraph that could be considered a disease is \"glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),\" which is a protein associated with various neurological disorders."},
