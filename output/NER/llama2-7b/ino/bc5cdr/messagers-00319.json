Clinical symptoms: The term \"clinical symptoms\" refers to the observable signs or abnormalities that a patient exhibits due to a disease or condition. In this context, the paragraph mentions that clinical symptoms occurred concurrently with the decline in the SNAP index, suggesting that the symptoms are related to the decline in the index.\n2. Decline in SNAP index: The SNAP index (Soil Nitrogen Availability Potential) is a measure of the nitrogen availability in the soil. A decline in the SNAP index indicates a decrease in the amount of nitrogen available to the plants, which can lead to a range of problems, including reduced plant growth and yield. In this paragraph, the decline in the SNAP index is mentioned as occurring concurrently with the clinical symptoms, suggesting that the decline in the index is related to the symptoms."},
