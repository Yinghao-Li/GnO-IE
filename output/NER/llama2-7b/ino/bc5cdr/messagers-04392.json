Pulmonary edema: This is a condition where there is an accumulation of fluid in the lungs, which can lead to shortness of breath, coughing, and other respiratory problems.\n2. Shock: This is a serious medical condition where the body's circulatory system is unable to provide enough oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues.\n3. Lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, specifically the lymphatic system.\n4. TNF-alpha: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is a protein that is involved in the immune response and can cause inflammation.\n5. PAF: Platelet-activating factor is a chemical that can cause platelets to clot and can contribute to inflammation.\n\nSo, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Pulmonary edema\n* Shock\n* Lymphoma\n\nThe other entities mentioned are:\n\n* TNF-alpha (a protein)\n* PAF (a chemical)"},
