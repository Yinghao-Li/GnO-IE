    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Chemical\":\n\n1. Randomised: This is a statistical term that refers to the process of assigning participants to different groups or treatments randomly, without any bias or prejudice.\n2. Double-blind: This term refers to a study design in which neither the participants nor the researchers know which group or treatment each participant is assigned to. This is done to minimize bias and ensure that the results are accurate and reliable.\n3. Placebo-controlled: This term refers to a study design in which one group of participants receives a placebo (a dummy treatment with no active ingredients) and the other group receives the actual treatment being tested. This allows researchers to compare the effects of the actual treatment with those of the placebo.\n4. Crossover: This term refers to a study design in which participants switch between different treatments or groups at some point during the study. This allows researchers to compare the effects of different treatments on the same participants.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Randomisation\n2. Double-blindness\n3. Placebo-control\n4. Crossover"},
