Adrenaline: This is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that plays a crucial role in the body's \"fight or flight\" response to stress. Abnormal levels of adrenaline can be associated with various diseases, such as adrenal insufficiency, Cushing's syndrome, and pheochromocytoma.\n2. Noradrenaline: This is another hormone produced by the adrenal glands that has a similar function to adrenaline. However, noradrenaline is not associated with the same range of diseases as adrenaline.\n\nSo, while the term \"Disease\" does not appear directly in the paragraph, we can identify two disease-related entities: Adrenaline and Noradrenaline."},
