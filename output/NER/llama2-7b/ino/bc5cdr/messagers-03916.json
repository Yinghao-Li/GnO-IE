Toxic actions: This is a disease entity, as it refers to the harmful effects of flurazepam on living organisms.\n2. Flurazepam: This is a drug entity, as it is a specific medication that can cause toxic actions.\n3. Cats: This is a living entity, as it refers to a specific species of animal that can be affected by the toxic actions of flurazepam.\n4. Mice: This is a living entity, as it refers to a specific species of small mammal that can be affected by the toxic actions of flurazepam.\n5. Rats: This is a living entity, as it refers to a specific species of large rodent that can be affected by the toxic actions of flurazepam.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
