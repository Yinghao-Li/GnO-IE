TDF-related kidney disease\n * This is a broader category that includes various types of kidney diseases related to TDF (Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate).\n2. Kidney tubular dysfunction\n * This refers to any dysfunction or damage to the tubules in the kidneys.\n3. Glomerular dysfunction\n * This refers to any dysfunction or damage to the glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n4. Fanconi syndrome\n * This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and causes them to leak large amounts of protein and other waste products into the urine.\n\nSo, there are four disease entities mentioned in the paragraph: TDF-related kidney disease, kidney tubular dysfunction, glomerular dysfunction, and Fanconi syndrome."},
