Coronary spasm: This is a condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become inflamed or constricted, leading to chest pain or discomfort.\n2.

Coronary spasm: This is a medical condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become narrow or constricted. This can lead to chest pain or discomfort, and in severe cases, can cause a heart attack.\n3.
