Histological evidence - This refers to the study of tissue samples under a microscope to identify the presence of certain chemicals or structures.\n2. Acute rejection - This refers to a sudden and severe reaction to a foreign substance, often involving the immune system.\n3. Chronic rejection - This refers to a gradual and persistent reaction to a foreign substance, often involving the immune system.\n4. Interstitial fibrosis - This refers to the accumulation of scar tissue in the interstitial space between cells.\n5. Tubular atrophy - This refers to the degeneration or shrinkage of tubular structures in the kidney.\n6.
