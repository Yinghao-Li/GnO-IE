To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Spontaneous renal recovery\" - This refers to the recovery of the kidneys from a disease or injury without any external intervention.\n2. \"mild interstitial fibrosis\" - Interstitial fibrosis refers to the scarring of the tissue between the kidney's tubules. Mild means that the scarring is not severe.\n3. \"tubular atrophy\" - Tubular atrophy refers to the shrinkage or wasting of the tubules in the kidneys.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Interstitial fibrosis\n2. Tubular atrophy\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
