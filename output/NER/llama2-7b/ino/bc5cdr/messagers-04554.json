Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection using lamivudine.\n2. Identify the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph: The disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\n3. Identify the entities related to the disease:\n * Hepatitis B virus (HBV)\n * Lamivudine (the drug used to treat HBV infection)\n4. Identify the entities that are not related to the disease:\n * Placebo (the control treatment used in the study)\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection\", and the entities related to the disease are \"Hepatitis B virus (HBV)\" and \"lamivudine\". The entity \"placebo\" is not related to the disease."},

HBV is the cause of acute and chronic hepatitis, and it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer if left untreated.\n3. DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all living organisms.
