Diabetes: The paragraph mentions \"insulin-independent GLUT3 transporter\", which is associated with diabetes.\n2. Galactose: The paragraph mentions \"d-galactose\", which is a type of sugar that is associated with certain metabolic disorders, including galactosemia, a rare genetic disorder.\n3. Glucose: The paragraph mentions \"glucose\", which is a type of sugar that is involved in various metabolic processes in the body, including the metabolism of d-galactose.\n4. Leloir pathway: The paragraph mentions the \"Leloir pathway\", which is a metabolic pathway involved in the metabolism of sugars, including d-galactose.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are diabetes, galactosemia, and metabolic disorders related to the metabolism of sugars."},
