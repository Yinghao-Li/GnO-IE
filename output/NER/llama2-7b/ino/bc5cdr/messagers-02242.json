Electrolyte imbalance: Electrolytes are essential minerals that carry an electric charge and play a crucial role in various bodily functions, including maintaining proper heart function. An imbalance of electrolytes can disrupt the normal functioning of the heart, leading to cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and even cardiac arrest.\n2. Cardiac events: Cardiac events refer to any abnormal heart rhythms or other heart-related problems that can occur due to various factors, including electrolyte imbalance. These events can range from mild arrhythmias to life-threatening conditions such as ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia."},

Electrolytes: Electrolytes are chemical substances that carry an electric charge when dissolved in a solvent, such as water. In the context of the paragraph, electrolytes refer to the ions that are involved in the imbalance causing the cardiac events.\n2. Cardiac events: Cardiac events refer to any abnormal or irregular heartbeat, such as arrhythmias, heart attacks, or other cardiac problems. In this case, the paragraph specifically mentions acute life-threatening cardiac events, which are caused by the electrolyte imbalance.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
