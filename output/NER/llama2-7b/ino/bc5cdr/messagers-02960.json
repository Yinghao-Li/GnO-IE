It is a group of eye disorders that can damage the optic nerve, leading to vision loss and blindness.\n2. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG): This is a specific type of glaucoma that is characterized by the slow clogging of the drainage channels in the eye, leading to increased pressure inside the eye and damage to the optic nerve.\n3. Secondary glaucoma: This is a type of glaucoma that develops as a result of another underlying disease or condition, such as a cataract, retinal detachment, or uveitis. In the given paragraph, the author mentions that untreated patients can develop secondary glaucoma that resembles primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)."},

Untreated - \"untreated\" is an adjective that refers to the state of not being treated or managed, and in this context, it refers to the lack of treatment for a medical condition.\n2. Glaucoma - Glaucoma is a type of eye disease that is characterized by the buildup of pressure in the eye, which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. It is a chemical entity because it is a medical condition that affects the eye and is caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the eye.\n3. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) - POAG is a type of glaucoma that is characterized by the slow clogging of the drainage channels in the eye, which leads to an increase in eye pressure. It is a chemical entity because it is a medical condition that affects the eye and is caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the eye.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are \"untreated\", \"glaucoma\", and \"POAG\"."},
