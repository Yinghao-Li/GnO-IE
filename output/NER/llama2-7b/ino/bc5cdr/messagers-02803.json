Seizures: The paragraph mentions the onset of seizures, which is a symptom of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy.\n2. GABAergic system: GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of neurons. The \"GABAergic system\" refers to the network of neurons that use GABA as their primary neurotransmitter.\n3. Dopaminergic system: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motivation, reward, and movement control. The \"dopaminergic system\" refers to the network of neurons that use dopamine as their primary neurotransmitter.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are seizures, which can be caused by various neurological disorders, and the GABAergic and dopaminergic systems, which are involved in regulating the activity of neurons and are affected in various neurological disorders."},
