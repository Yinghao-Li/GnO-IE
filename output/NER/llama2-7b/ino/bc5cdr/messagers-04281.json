It is not a disease entity, but rather a medical intervention.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Nausea\n* Vomiting\n\nThese are the conditions or disorders that the patients are experiencing, and the paragraph is comparing the time to first episode and the use of additional antiemetic medication in different dosing groups."},
