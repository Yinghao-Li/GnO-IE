Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * 7e\n * catalepsy\n * haloperidol\n2. Identify the nouns that refer to a medical condition or disease:\n * catalepsy (a neurological disorder characterized by a rigid, immobile state)\n * haloperidol (a medication used to treat psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia)\n3. Determine if the nouns identified in step 2 are disease entities:\n * Yes, \"catalepsy\" is a disease entity.\n * No, \"haloperidol\" is not a disease entity, it is a medication.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"catalepsy\"."},
