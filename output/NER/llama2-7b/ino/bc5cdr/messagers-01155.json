Heart failure: This refers to a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n4. Iron overload: This refers to an excessive accumulation of iron in the body, which can lead to damage to various organs, including the heart.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
