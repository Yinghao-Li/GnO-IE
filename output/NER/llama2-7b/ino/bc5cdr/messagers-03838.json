Hypertension: The paragraph mentions the pressor effect of PPA (phenylephrine), which is a hormone that can cause hypertension (high blood pressure).\n2. Hyperadrenergic state: The paragraph also mentions the interaction between propranolol and norepinephrine, which is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in the regulation of the body's \"fight or flight\" response. In a hyperadrenergic state, the body produces excessive amounts of norepinephrine, which can lead to symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, and increased heart rate.\n\nI hope this helps!
