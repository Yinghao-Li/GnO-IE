    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Cytomegalovirus (CMV)\" - This is a disease entity, a type of virus that can cause infection in humans.\n2. \"shedding or serological rises in antibody titer\" - These are both terms related to the detection and measurement of CMV infection. \"Shedding\" refers to the release of CMV particles from an infected person's body, while \"serological rises\" refer to the presence of antibodies against CMV in the blood.\n3. \"or both\" - This phrase indicates that both shedding and serological rises can occur in CMV-infected individuals.\n4. \"78 % of cyclosporine patients\" - This is a percentage that indicates the percentage of individuals in a specific group (cyclosporine patients) who experienced CMV shedding or serological rises.\n5. \"76 % of Aza patients\" - This is another percentage that indicates the percentage of individuals in a different group (Aza patients) who experienced CMV shedding or serological rises.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cytomegalovirus (CMV)\n\nI hope this helps!
