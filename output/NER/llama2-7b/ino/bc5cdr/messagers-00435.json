Connective tissue: This refers to a type of tissue that provides support and structure to the body's organs and tissues. Connective tissue is made up of cells and a matrix of proteins, glycoproteins, and other molecules.\n3. Muscular tissue: This refers to a type of tissue that is responsible for movement and contraction in the body. Muscular tissue is made up of cells called muscle fibers, which are capable of contracting and relaxing in response to electrical signals.\n4.
