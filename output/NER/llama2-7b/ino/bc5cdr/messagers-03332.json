Renal vascular resistance: This refers to the resistance to blood flow through the kidneys, which can lead to decreased kidney function.\n3. Urinary excretion: This refers to the passage of waste products through the urine.\n4. Total protein: This refers to the total amount of protein present in the urine.\n5. Glucose: This refers to the presence of glucose in the urine.\n6. Sodium: This refers to the presence of sodium ions in the urine.\n7. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL): This is a protein produced by the kidneys in response to injury or inflammation.\n8. N-acetyl B-D-glucosaminidase (NAG): This is an enzyme produced by the kidneys that helps to break down glycoproteins and glycolipids.\n9. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1): This is a protein produced by the kidneys in response to injury or inflammation.\n10. Claudin-2: This is a protein that helps to regulate the transport of ions and small molecules across the kidney tubular cells.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."},
