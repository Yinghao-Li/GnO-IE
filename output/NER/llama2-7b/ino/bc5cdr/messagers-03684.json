Identify the disease entities:\n * Based on the context, the disease entities that can be identified are:\n  + CYA (cytotoxic agent)\n  + Cardiotoxicity (a type of toxicity that affects the heart)\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* CYA (cytotoxic agent)\n* Cardiotoxicity (a type of toxicity that affects the heart)"},
