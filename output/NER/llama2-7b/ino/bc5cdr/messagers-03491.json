Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacteria.\n2. Lethal: This adjective modifies the noun \"pertussis vaccine reaction\" and indicates that the reaction can be severe or life-threatening.\n3. Histamine H1 antagonists: These are medications that are used to treat allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can occur as a side effect of the pertussis vaccine. Histamine H1 antagonists work by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical messenger that is involved in allergic reactions. Examples of histamine H1 antagonists include diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine."},
