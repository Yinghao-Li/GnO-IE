NDI (Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus) - a rare kidney disorder that affects the body's ability to regulate fluid levels.\n2. Lithium - a medication used to treat bipolar disorder, which can cause Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus as a side effect.\n3. AQP2 (Aquaporin-2) - a protein that helps regulate water transport in the kidneys.\n4. UT-A1 (Uromodulin-Tamm-Horsfall Protein-1) - a protein that helps regulate urine concentration and flow.\n\nSo, the paragraph suggests that ablation (removal) of PKCa (Protein Kinase C alpha) can prevent the development of severe polyuria (excessive urine production) associated with lithium therapy in Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus."},
