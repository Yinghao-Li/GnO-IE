To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Drug-induced baboon syndrome\" is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is a fictional disease, so we can't find any information about it in medical literature.\n2. \"Topical ketoconazole\" is a medication that can cause a skin reaction in some people. It is not a disease entity, but rather a medication that can cause an adverse reaction.\n3. \"Baboon syndrome\" is also a fictional disease entity. It is not a recognized medical condition in any medical literature.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"drug-induced baboon syndrome.\""},
