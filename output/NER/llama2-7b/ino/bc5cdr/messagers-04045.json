Doxorubicin: This is a drug or medication that is used to treat various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer.\n2. Myocardial scintigraphy: This is a medical imaging technique that uses a small amount of a radioactive tracer (in this case, [omega-I-131] heptadecanoic acid) to visualize the heart muscle (myocardium) and detect any abnormalities or diseases.\n3. Echocardiography: This is another medical imaging technique that uses sound waves to create images of the heart and its structures, including the heart valves, chambers, and walls.\n4. Dogs: This is the species of animal that is being studied in this particular research.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Doxorubicin (a drug used to treat cancer)\n* Myocardial scintigraphy (a medical imaging technique used to visualize the heart muscle)\n* Echocardiography ( another medical imaging technique used to visualize the heart)\n\nI hope this helps!
