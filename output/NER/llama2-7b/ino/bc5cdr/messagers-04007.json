Sinus rhythm: This refers to the normal, regular heartbeat that originates in the sinus node, which is the natural pacemaker of the heart.\n3. Sinoatrial (SA) block: This is a type of conduction disturbance in the heart, where the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are blocked or delayed between the sinus node and the atrioventricular (AV) node.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Propranolol-induced sinoatrial block\n2. Sinus rhythm\n3. Sinoatrial (SA) block"},
