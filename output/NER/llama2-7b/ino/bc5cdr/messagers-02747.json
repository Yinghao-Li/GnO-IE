Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Investigations\n * patient\n * convulsions\n2. Identify the nouns in each noun phrase:\n * Investigations: (no biochemical or structural central nervous system abnormalities)\n * patient: (no disease or disorder)\n * convulsions: (seizures or fits)\n3. Identify the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * seizures or fits (convulsions)\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"seizures or fits\" (convulsions)."},
