Encephalopathy: This refers to a general term for any type of brain dysfunction or damage, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, injury, or toxicity.\n2. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): This is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of certain medications, including antipsychotics. It is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic dysfunction, and altered mental status.\n3. Serotonin syndrome spectrum disorders: This refers to a group of conditions that are caused by excessive levels of serotonin in the body, which can lead to symptoms such as agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, and changes in blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n1. Encephalopathy\n2. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)\n3. Serotonin syndrome spectrum disorders"},
