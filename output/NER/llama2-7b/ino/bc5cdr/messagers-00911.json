Identify the keywords related to disease:\n * Catalepsy\n * Stereotypy\n * Apomorphine\n2. Check if any of these keywords are mentioned as a disease or condition:\n * Catalepsy: Yes, it is mentioned as a disease or condition.\n * Stereotypy: No, it is not mentioned as a disease or condition.\n * Apomorphine: Yes, it is mentioned as a disease or condition.\n3. Check if any of the entities mentioned in the paragraph are diseases or conditions:\n * Trazodone: No, it is not a disease or condition.\n * mg: No, it is not a disease or condition.\n * i.p.: No, it is not a disease or condition.\n * kg: No, it is not a disease or condition.\n4.
