To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Established visual field defects\" - This refers to a specific type of disease or condition that affects the visual field, such as a blind spot or distorted vision.\n2. \"presumed to be due to Vigabatrin therapy\" - This phrase suggests that the established visual field defects are believed to be caused by the medication Vigabatrin.\n3. \"did not usually progress\" - This sentence indicates that the disease entities (established visual field defects) did not worsen or progress over time, despite continuing use of the medication.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Established visual field defects\n2. Vigabatrin therapy (the medication believed to cause the defects)"},
