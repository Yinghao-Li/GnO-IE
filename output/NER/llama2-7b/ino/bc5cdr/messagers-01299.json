Prox-1: This is a protein that is specifically expressed in granule cells, and its immunoreactivity is being measured in the context of the optical fractionator method. Therefore, Prox-1 can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n2. Granule cell: A type of neuron located in the cerebral cortex, particularly in the hippocampus, that is characterized by a small, round cell body and numerous dendritic branches. The paragraph mentions \"granule cells\" specifically, which suggests that this is a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Prox-1\n2.
