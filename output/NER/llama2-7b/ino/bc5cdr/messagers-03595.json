Pilocarpine is a drug that can cause seizures in some individuals, and the paragraph is investigating how non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) affect the threshold for these seizures.\n2. Seizures: This is a general term for a type of neurological disorder characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, leading to symptoms such as convulsions, muscle stiffness, and loss of consciousness.\n\nI hope this helps!

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These are a class of drugs that are used to reduce inflammation and pain. They are called \"non-steroidal\" because they do not contain steroids. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen.\n2. Pilocarpine: This is a chemical substance that is used to induce seizures in animals. It is a cholinergic agonist, which means that it activates the same receptors in the brain as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Pilocarpine is used in scientific research to study the mechanisms of epilepsy and to test the effectiveness of new anticonvulsant drugs."},
