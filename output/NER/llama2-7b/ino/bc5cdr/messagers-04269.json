Cardiocirculatory arrest: This is a condition where the heart and blood vessels fail to function properly, leading to a decrease in blood pressure and a lack of oxygen supply to the body.\n2. Hypotension: This is a condition where the blood pressure is abnormally low. In this context, the patients in the PICU developed extreme hypotension within the first 48 hours of their admission.\n3. Dysrhythmias: This is a condition where the heartbeat is abnormal, either too fast or too slow. In this paragraph, the patients developed dysrhythmias within the first 48 hours of their admission to the PICU.\n\nSo, the three disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
