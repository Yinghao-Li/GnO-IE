P: This is an abbreviation for \"probability\", which is a statistical measure used to express the likelihood of an event occurring.\n3. .01: This is a numerical value that represents the probability level, which is less than 0.01, indicating a very low probability of the event occurring.\n4. Death: This is a physical state or process, where an organism or part of an organism has stopped functioning and is no longer alive.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
