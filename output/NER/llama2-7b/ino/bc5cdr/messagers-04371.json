Context: The paragraph mentions that steroids were given to patients for refractory rejection. This suggests that rejection is a medical condition that the patients are experiencing.\n2. Definition: Rejection is a medical condition in which the body's immune system attacks and rejects a transplanted organ.\n3. Prevalence: The paragraph states that 39% of patients received steroids for refractory rejection, which implies that a significant number of patients are experiencing rejection.\n4. Treatment: The paragraph mentions that weaning was always attempted and generally successful (64%). This suggests that the treatment for rejection involves weaning the patients off the steroids.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"rejection.\""},
