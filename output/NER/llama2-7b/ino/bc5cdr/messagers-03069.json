Odds ratio (OR): This is a statistical measure that is used to compare the odds of an event occurring in two groups. In this paragraph, the odds ratio is calculated to compare the odds of developing nephrotoxicity in patients who received mannitol versus those who did not.\n4. 95% CI: This stands for 95% confidence interval, which is a range of values that is used to estimate the probability of an event occurring. In this paragraph, the 95% CI is used to estimate the range of odds ratios that are likely to occur.\n5. P-value: This is a statistical measure that is used to determine the significance of a study.
