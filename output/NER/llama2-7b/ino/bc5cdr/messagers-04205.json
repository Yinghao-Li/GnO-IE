To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Skeletal movements\" - This is not a disease entity, but rather a symptom or side effect of the technique.\n2. \"Respiratory upset\" - This could be a disease entity, but it is not specified as such in the paragraph. It is more likely a symptom or side effect of the technique.\n3. \"One sufficiently severe to necessitate abandoning the technique\" - This could be a disease entity, as it implies that the patient experienced a severe and potentially dangerous condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Respiratory upset (although it is not specified as a disease entity)\n* The severe respiratory condition that necessitated abandoning the technique (which could be a disease entity)"},
