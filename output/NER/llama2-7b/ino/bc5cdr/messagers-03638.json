Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF): A clear, colorless fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, providing cushioning, support, and protection to the central nervous system.\n3. Brain: The organ that serves as the center of the nervous system, responsible for controlling and coordinating the body's functions, including thought, movement, and sensation.\n\nThese entities are mentioned in the paragraph as follows:\n\n* \"Fetal serum concentrations at onset of seizures in the mother were similar to maternal brain and CSF concentrations...\" (line 1) - This sentence mentions the comparison of fetal serum concentrations to both maternal brain and CSF concentrations.\n* \"correlated significantly with the former...\" (line 3) - This sentence mentions the correlation between the fetal serum concentrations and the former (i.e., the maternal brain and CSF concentrations).\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are seizures and CSF."},
