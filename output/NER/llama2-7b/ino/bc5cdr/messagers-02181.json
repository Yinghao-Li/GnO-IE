Paralysis: Paralysis is a condition where there is a loss of muscle function, resulting in a loss of movement or weakness in the affected area.\n2. Botox: Botox is a brand name for a type of botulinum toxin that is used to treat various medical conditions, including muscle spasms and stiffness.\n3. Arytenoid: The arytenoid is a small cartilaginous structure located in the larynx (voice box) that helps to support the vocal cords.\n4. Cricoarytenoid muscles: The cricoarytenoid muscles are a group of muscles located in the larynx that help to control the movement of the vocal cords.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are paralysis and botulinum toxin (Botox)."},

Botox: Botox is a chemical substance that is used to paralyze or relax muscles. It is a neurotoxin that is derived from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.\n2. Muscular process: A muscular process is a part of a muscle where the muscle fibers attach to the bone or other structures. In this context, the term \"muscular process\" is likely referring to the muscles of the larynx.\n3. Cricoarytenoid muscles: The cricoarytenoid muscles are a group of muscles in the larynx that are involved in the movement of the vocal cords.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
