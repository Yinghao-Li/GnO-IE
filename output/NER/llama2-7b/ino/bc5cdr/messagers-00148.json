Based on the context, the most likely disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Nephritis: The paragraph mentions that none of the patients needed dialysis or a renal biopsy, which are procedures commonly used to diagnose and manage nephritis.\n2. Kidney disease: The term \"renal\" refers to the kidneys, and the passage suggests that the patients' kidney function was affected in some way, without the need for dialysis or a biopsy. This could indicate a variety of kidney diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, or glomerulonephritis.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are likely nephritis and kidney disease."},
