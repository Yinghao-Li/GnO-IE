Local anesthetics: The paragraph mentions \"spinal anaesthesia,\" which is a type of regional anesthesia that involves injecting a local anesthetic into the spinal fluid around the spinal cord. Local anesthetics are chemical substances that are used to numb or block pain in a specific area of the body.\n2. Epinephrine: The paragraph also mentions \"epinephrine,\" which is a chemical that is often added to local anesthetics to prolong their duration of action. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor that helps to increase the effectiveness of local anesthetics by reducing blood flow to the area where they are injected.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are local anesthetics and epinephrine."},
