Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * Dyskinetic\n * patients\n * OPSE\n * nondyskinetic\n * Dunnett\n2. Determine if each noun refers to a disease entity:\n * Dyskinetic: No, \"dyskinetic\" is an adjective modifying the noun \"patients\".\n * Patients: No, \"patients\" is a noun referring to individuals with a medical condition.\n * OPSE: No, \"OPSE\" is an abbreviation for \"optokinetic reflex eye movement\".\n * Nondyskinetic: No, \"nondyskinetic\" is an adjective modifying the noun \"patients\".\n * Dunnett: No, \"Dunnett\" is a surname.\n3. Identify the disease entity associated with the nouns:\n * Patients: The disease entity associated with the noun \"patients\" is dyskinetic movement disorder.\n4. Determine the relationship between the disease entity and the nouns:\n * Patients: The disease entity \"dyskinetic movement disorder\" is associated with the noun \"patients\".\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"dyskinetic movement disorder\" and \"patients\"."},
