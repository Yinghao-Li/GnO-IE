Parkinson's disease: The paragraph mentions \"training on each training day,\" which suggests that the subjects are undergoing some form of exercise or training program. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, including motor skills and coordination, which may be improved through exercise and training.\n2. Dopamine deficiency: The paragraph mentions \"dopamine receptor agonist pergolide,\" which is a medication that stimulates dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter involved in movement and motivation, and a deficiency in dopamine can contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are Parkinson's disease and dopamine deficiency."},
