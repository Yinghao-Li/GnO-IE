Entity: Erdosteine\n * Type: Drug\n * Function: Administration of Erdosteine with VCM injections caused...\n3. Entity: VCM\n * Type: Drug\n * Function: VCM alone caused...\n4. Entity: Renal tissue\n * Type: Organ\n * Function: Renal tissue was affected by the administration of Erdosteine and VCM.\n5. Entity: MDA (Malondialdehyde)\n * Type: Chemical compound\n * Function: MDA is a biomarker of oxidative stress.\n6. Entity: NAG (N-acetyl-Î²-D-glucosaminidase)\n * Type: Enzyme\n * Function: NAG is an enzyme involved in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans.\n7. Entity: SOD (Superoxide dismutase)\n * Type: Enzyme\n * Function: SOD is an enzyme that protects cells against oxidative damage by converting superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.\n8. Entity: CAT (Catalase)\n * Type: Enzyme\n * Function: CAT is an enzyme that protects cells against oxidative damage by converting hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.\n\nSo, the entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Erdosteine\n* VCM\n* Renal tissue\n* MDA\n* NAG\n* SOD\n* CAT"},
