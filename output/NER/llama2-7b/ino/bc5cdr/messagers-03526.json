It refers to the abnormal enlargement of the heart muscle, which can lead to various complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke.\n2. Hypertension: This is a related disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. Hypertension is defined as a blood pressure reading of 140/90 mmHg or higher, and it is a major risk factor for heart hypertrophy.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Heart hypertrophy\n2. Hypertension"},

Beta-receptor blockers: These are a class of medications that block the effects of beta-adrenergic receptors in the body. Beta-adrenergic receptors are found in the heart and other organs and play a role in regulating heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological processes.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
