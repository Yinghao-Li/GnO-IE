Hypertension: This is a disease characterized by elevated blood pressure, which is defined as a blood pressure reading of 140/90 mmHg or higher. The patient's blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, which is within the normal range, so hypertension is not present in this case.\n2. Tachycardia: This is a disease characterized by a rapid heart rate, which is defined as a heart rate of 100 x / minute or higher. The patient's pulse rate of 100 x / minute falls within the normal range, so tachycardia is not present in this case.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities identified in the given paragraph."},
