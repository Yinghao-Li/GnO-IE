Buffer: This is a general term for a solution used to maintain a constant pH or ionic strength in a biological system. In this context, the buffer is likely a solution used to preserve the tissue slices during the incubation period.\n2. Prostaglandin: This is a type of lipid mediator that is involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation, pain, and immune response. Prostaglandins are synthesized from arachidonic acid by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX).\n3. Radioimmunoassay: This is a laboratory technique used to measure the presence of a specific protein or other molecule in a sample using radioactive isotopes. In this context, the radioimmunoassay is likely used to measure the level of prostaglandin synthesis in the incubated tissue slices.\n\nI hope this helps!
