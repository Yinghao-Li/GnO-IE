Paralysis\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Complications: Complications are a type of chemical entity that refers to any undesirable or unintended consequences that can arise from a medical treatment or condition. In this context, the term \"complications\" refers to the additional problems that can occur in patients with pre-existing contralateral paralysis.\n2. Contralateral: Contralateral is a term used in anatomy to describe the opposite side of the body. In this context, \"contralateral paralysis\" refers to paralysis of the opposite side of the body, which can be caused by a chemical entity such as a toxin or a disease.\n3. Paralysis: Paralysis is a chemical entity that refers to a condition where there is a loss of muscle function due to damage to the nervous system. In this context, \"pre-existing contralateral paralysis\" refers to paralysis of the opposite side of the body that exists before the development of additional complications."},
