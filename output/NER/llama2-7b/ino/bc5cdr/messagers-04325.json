Seizures: This is a medical condition caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can be triggered by various chemical factors.\n2.

P: P is a chemical symbol for the element phosphorus, which is used in various chemical reactions in the body.\n4. .01 and .05: These are chemical notation symbols used to represent very small numbers, such as 0.01 and 0.05, which are commonly used in statistical analysis.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"seizures\" and \"death\"."},
