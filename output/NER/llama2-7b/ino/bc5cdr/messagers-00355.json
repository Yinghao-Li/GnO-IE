Identify the nouns in the paragraph:\n * Microglia\n * cells\n * group\n * controls\n * striatum\n * hippocampus\n2. Determine whether each noun refers to a disease entity or not:\n * Microglia: Not a disease entity (a type of immune cell)\n * cells: Not a disease entity (plural form of \"cell\")\n * group: Not a disease entity (a collection of things)\n * controls: Not a disease entity (a group of individuals or samples used for comparison)\n * striatum: Not a disease entity (a region in the brain)\n * hippocampus: Not a disease entity (a region in the brain)\n3. Identify the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * High-dose group: A disease entity (a group of individuals or samples that received a high dose of something)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"high-dose group\"."},
