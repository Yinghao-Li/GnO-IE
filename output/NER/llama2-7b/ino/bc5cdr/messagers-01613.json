Thromboxane: This is a chemical entity, specifically a prostaglandin, which is a type of eicosanoid. Thromboxane is produced by the enzyme thromboxane synthase from arachidonic acid.\n2. COX-1: This is another chemical entity, specifically a cyclooxygenase enzyme. There are two types of cyclooxygenases: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and is involved in the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, while COX-2 is inducible and plays a key role in inflammation and pain.\n3. COX-2: This is the same chemical entity as COX-1, but referred to by a different abbreviation.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Thromboxane\n* COX-1\n* COX-2"},
