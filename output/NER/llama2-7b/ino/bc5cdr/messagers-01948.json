To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"disorder\" - This is a broad term that refers to any abnormality or abnormal functioning of a body part or system. It can be used to describe a wide range of conditions, including diseases, injuries, and mental health disorders.\n2. \"that disorder\" - This refers specifically to the particular disorder or disease that the paragraph is discussing.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, the \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n* \"disorder\"\n* \"that disorder\"\n\nI hope this helps!
