Thrombocytopenia\n\nLet me explain each of these entities:\n\n1. Renal amyloidosis: A condition in which abnormal proteins called amyloid deposits accumulate in the kidneys, leading to damage and impaired kidney function.\n2. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT): A blood clot that forms in a deep vein, typically in the legs.\n3. Pulmonary embolism: A blockage in the pulmonary artery, which can occur when a blood clot travels from a deep vein in the leg to the lungs.\n4. Thrombocytopenia: A condition in which the blood platelet count is lower than normal, which can increase the risk of bleeding.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
