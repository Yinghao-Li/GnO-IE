Anterior infarction (ANT-MI) - This is a subtype of myocardial infarction, referring to a specific location or distribution of the damage to the heart muscle.\n3. Inferior infarction (INF-MI) - This is another subtype of myocardial infarction, referring to a different location or distribution of the damage to the heart muscle.\n\nSo, in summary, the three groups of patients in the paragraph are:\n\n* Non-MI group (19 patients): These patients do not have myocardial infarction.\n* ANT-MI group (14 patients): These patients have anterior infarction, which is a subtype of myocardial infarction.\n* INF-MI group (8 patients): These patients have inferior infarction, which is another subtype of myocardial infarction."},
