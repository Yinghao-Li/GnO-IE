Mast cells: Mast cells are a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system. They are involved in the release of histamine and other chemical mediators in response to allergens.\n2. Histamine: Histamine is a chemical mediator released by mast cells in response to allergens. It causes blood vessels to dilate, smooth muscle contraction, and increased mucus production, among other effects.\n3. Therapeutic dose: A therapeutic dose is the recommended or standard dose of a drug or other substance used to treat a medical condition.\n4. P: P is a chemical symbol for the element phosphorus, which is a key component of many biological molecules, including DNA and RNA.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Mast cells\n* Histamine\n* Therapeutic dose\n* P (phosphorus)"},
