Myocardial lipid: This refers to the accumulation of lipids (fats) in the myocardium (the muscular layer of the heart).\n2. Doxorubicin: This is a drug that is used to treat various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. It works by interfering with the DNA replication process in cancer cells, which can help slow or stop the growth of cancer. However, doxorubicin can also have negative effects on the heart, including the accumulation of lipids in the myocardium.\n3. Heart disease: The accumulation of lipids in the myocardium can lead to various heart problems, including heart disease.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myocardial lipid\n2. Heart disease"},
