Depression: The paragraph mentions the antidepressant trazodone, which suggests that the study is focused on the treatment of depression.\n2. Dopamine-dependent behaviors: The paragraph mentions the effects of trazodone on dopamine-dependent behaviors in rats, which implies that the study is also focused on the role of dopamine in behavior and the potential effects of trazodone on these behaviors.\n3. 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist: The paragraph mentions that trazodone is a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, which means that it blocks the action of serotonin (5-HT) on certain receptors in the brain. This suggests that the study may also be related to the treatment of serotonin-related disorders, such as depression or anxiety.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are depression and dopamine-dependent behaviors."},

It is a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist.\n2. 5-HT2A/2C receptor: This is a type of receptor found in the brain that is involved in regulating mood and other physiological processes. Trazodone acts as an antagonist at these receptors, which means it blocks their activity.\n3. Dopamine: This is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in motivation, pleasure, and reward processing in the brain. Trazodone's effects on dopamine-dependent behaviors are being studied in the paragraph.\n4. Rats: These are the animals being used in the study to investigate the effects of trazodone on dopamine-dependent behaviors.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Trazodone\n* 5-HT2A/2C receptor\n* Dopamine\n* Rats"},
