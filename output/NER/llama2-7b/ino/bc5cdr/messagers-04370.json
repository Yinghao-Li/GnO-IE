Lymphocyte: The paragraph mentions \"antilymphocyte globulin,\" which is a medication used to treat certain immune system disorders, including lymphocytopenia (low levels of white blood cells).\n2. Autoimmune disorders: The use of antilymphocyte globulin suggests that the patient may have an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues.\n3. Immune system disorders: The paragraph mentions \"prophylaxis with antilymphocyte globulin,\" which is a preventive measure used to treat or prevent immune system disorders.\n\nTherefore, the potential disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Lymphocyte\n2. Autoimmune disorders\n3. Immune system disorders"},
