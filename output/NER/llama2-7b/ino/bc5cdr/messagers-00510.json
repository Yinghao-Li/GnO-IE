BBB: Brain-Brain Barrier\n\nExplanation: BBB is a protective barrier that separates the brain from the bloodstream. It is composed of specialized cells and proteins that prevent the entry of certain substances into the brain.\n\n2. seizure: A seizure is a temporary disturbance in brain function that can cause a variety of symptoms, including uncontrolled movements, altered consciousness, and loss of sensation.\n\nExplanation: Seizures can be caused by various factors, including genetic mutations, head injuries, infections, and certain medications.\n\n3. breakdown: The term \"breakdown\" in this context refers to the disruption of the BBB caused by the seizure.\n\nExplanation: During a seizure, the BBB can become damaged or disrupted, allowing certain substances to enter the brain and potentially leading to neurological problems."},
