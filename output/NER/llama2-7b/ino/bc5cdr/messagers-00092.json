In the paragraph, the term \"anorexigens\" is mentioned as one of the disease entities associated with pulmonary hypertension in the United States.\n2. Pulmonary hypertension:\nPulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It is characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, which can lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, and other symptoms.\n3. North American pulmonary hypertension:\nThe term \"North American pulmonary hypertension\" refers to the study of pulmonary hypertension in the United States and Canada.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Anorexigens (drugs that suppress appetite)\n* Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs)\n* North American pulmonary hypertension (study of pulmonary hypertension in the United States and Canada)"},
