Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is \"the effects of saline and apigenin on retention trial\".\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Saline\n * Apigenin\n * Retention trial\n3. Determine whether each entity is a disease or not:\n * Saline: Not a disease (a saline solution is a sterile solution used for various medical purposes, including injection or irrigation)\n * Apigenin: Not a disease (apigenin is a flavonoid compound found in various plants, including chamomile)\n * Retention trial: Not a disease (a retention trial refers to a type of clinical trial that involves measuring the amount of a substance (e.g., a drug) in the body over a specific period of time)\n\nTherefore, the only entity in the paragraph that is not a disease is \"retention trial\"."},
