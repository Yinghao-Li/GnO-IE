It refers to an increased sensitivity to pain.\n2. Carrageenan-induced paw inflammation: This is one of the two pain models used in the experiment. It is a model of acute inflammation that is induced by injecting carrageenan into the paw of a rat.\n3. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy: This is the second pain model used in the experiment. It is a model of chronic pain that is induced by injecting streptozotocin into the rat's tail vein, leading to the development of diabetes.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are hyperalgesia, carrageenan-induced paw inflammation, and streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy."},
