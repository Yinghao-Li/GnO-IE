Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * Verapamil\n * healthy controls\n * macroprolactinoma\n * microprolactinoma\n * macroprolactinemia\n * pseudoprolactinoma\n * risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia\n2. Determine whether each noun phrase refers to a disease or not:\n * Verapamil: Not a disease (it's a drug)\n * healthy controls: Not a disease (it's a group of people)\n * macroprolactinoma: Yes, a disease (a type of prolactinoma)\n * microprolactinoma: Yes, a disease (a type of prolactinoma)\n * macroprolactinemia: Yes, a disease (elevated prolactin levels)\n * pseudoprolactinoma: No, not a disease (a benign prolactinoma)\n * risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia: Yes, a disease (elevated prolactin levels caused by risperidone)\n3. Identify the disease entities in the paragraph:\n * Macroprolactinoma\n * Microprolactinoma\n * Macroprolactinemia\n * Risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Macroprolactinoma\n* Microprolactinoma\n* Macroprolactinemia\n* Risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia"},
