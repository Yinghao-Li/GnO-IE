Myocardial injury refers to damage to the muscular tissue of the heart.\n2. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs): This is a type of cell that is used in the cytotoxicity assay to study the effects of aconitine on cardiac cells.\n3. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): This is an enzyme that is released into the culture medium of NRVMs when they are damaged or dying. The level of LDH in the culture medium can be used as an indicator of myocardial injury.\n4. Serum cardiac enzymes: These are enzymes that are present in the bloodstream and can be used to diagnose and monitor cardiovascular diseases. The activities of these enzymes in the bloodstream can be measured in rats to assess the effects of aconitine on the heart.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
