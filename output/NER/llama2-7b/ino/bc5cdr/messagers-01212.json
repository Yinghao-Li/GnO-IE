To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"LNNA\" - This could be an abbreviation for a disease or condition, such as \"Lupus Nephritis\" or \"Liver Nephrology Association\".\n2. \"hypertension\" - This is a disease entity, which refers to high blood pressure.\n3. \"1 or 2 weeks after LNNA\" - This phrase could indicate that the study is looking at the progression of a disease over time, with \"1 week\" and \"2 weeks\" being the time points being studied.\n4. \"mean circulatory filling pressure\" - This is a disease entity, which refers to a measure of the pressure in the circulatory system.\n\nSo, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the disease entities are:\n\n* Hypertension\n* LNNA (Lupus Nephritis or Liver Nephrology Association)\n* Mean circulatory filling pressure"},
