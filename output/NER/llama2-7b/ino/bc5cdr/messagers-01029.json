Nonaspirin NSAIDs (a group of drugs, not a specific disease)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Aspirin: Aspirin is a medication used to treat pain, reduce inflammation, and prevent blood clots. It is classified as an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug).\n2. Pyrazolones: Pyrazolones are a class of medications used to treat pain and reduce inflammation. They are also NSAIDs.\n3. Paracetamol: Paracetamol is a medication used to treat pain and reduce fever. It is not an NSAID, but rather a different class of medication called acetaminophen.\n4.
