Glomerular hypertrophy: This refers to the enlargement of the glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n3. Glomerulosclerosis: This refers to the hardening of the glomeruli, which can lead to kidney damage and impaired kidney function.\n4. Nephrotic syndrome: This is a group of symptoms that include proteinuria, edema (swelling), and decreased urine production.\n5. Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN): This is a chemical that is used to induce nephrotic syndrome in rats.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
