Tumor cell proliferation: This refers to the abnormal growth and multiplication of cancer cells.\n2. Cell cycle arrest: This refers to a process where cancer cells stop dividing and growing due to the action of a drug or other treatment.\n3. Apoptotic tumor cells: These are cancer cells that undergo programmed cell death, which is a normal process that helps to eliminate damaged or abnormal cells from the body.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Tumor cell proliferation (cancer)\n* Cell cycle arrest (cancer)\n* Apoptotic tumor cells (cancer)"},
