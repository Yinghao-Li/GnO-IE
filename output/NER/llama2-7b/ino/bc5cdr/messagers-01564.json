Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is \"capsaicin-induced burning.\"\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Capsaicin\n * Burning\n * Incidence\n * Time course\n * Severity\n3. Determine whether each entity is a disease or not:\n * Capsaicin: Not a disease, but a substance that can cause burning sensations.\n * Burning: Not a disease, but a symptom of various conditions.\n * Incidence: Not a disease, but the frequency or occurrence of something (in this case, the frequency of capsaicin-induced burning).\n * Time course: Not a disease, but a term used to describe the progression or duration of a disease or condition.\n * Severity: Not a disease, but a term used to describe the intensity or gravity of a disease or condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Burning (as a symptom)\n\nI hope this helps!

To identify the chemical entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Treatment response\": This refers to the outcome or effect of the treatment or intervention being studied. In this case, the treatment is likely a medication or therapy used to treat capsaicin-induced burning.\n2. \"incidence\": This refers to the occurrence or frequency of something. In this case, the incidence of capsaicin-induced burning refers to the number of people who experience this condition.\n3. \"time-course\": This refers to the sequence of events or changes that occur over time. In this case, the time-course of capsaicin-induced burning refers to the way the burning sensation develops or changes over time after exposure to capsaicin.\n4. \"severity\": This refers to the degree or intensity of something. In this case, the severity of capsaicin-induced burning refers to the degree of discomfort or pain experienced by the individual.\n5. \"capsaicin\": This is the chemical entity being studied in the paragraph. It is a substance that can cause a burning sensation when applied to the skin or mucous membranes.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Capsaicin\n\nI hope this helps!
