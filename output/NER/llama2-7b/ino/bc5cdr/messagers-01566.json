MIP synthase inhibition\n2. In vivo study in rats"},

Myo - inositol - 1 - phosphate (MIP)\n * Myo: a prefix indicating that the molecule is a myo-inositol derivative\n * Inositol: a sugar molecule\n * Phosphate: a phosphate group (-PO4)\n * MIP: Myo-inositol 1-phosphate\n2. Inhibition\n * Inhibition: a term indicating the molecule is inhibiting or blocking the activity of something\n3. In vivo study in rats\n * In vivo: a term indicating the study was conducted in a living organism (in this case, rats)\n * Study: a term indicating the investigation or examination of something\n * Rats: a species of mammal\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Myo-inositol 1-phosphate (MIP)\n* Phosphate group (-PO4)\n* Inhibition"},
