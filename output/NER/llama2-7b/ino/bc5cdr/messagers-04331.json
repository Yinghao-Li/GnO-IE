Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide anions (O2-) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen (O2).\n2. dimethylthiourea (DMTU) is a chemical compound that is used as a reducing agent in various biochemical reactions.\n3. GM stands for Genetic Modification, which refers to the manipulation of an organism's genetic material to produce a desired trait or characteristic.\n4. CIn stands for Cytoplasmic Inhibition, which refers to the inhibition of a cellular process or function within the cytoplasm of a cell."},
