Neuroleptic: This refers to a type of drug that acts on the nervous system, particularly the brain and spinal cord. Neuroleptics are commonly used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.\n2. Serotonin: This is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, appetite, and other physiological processes. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur when excessive levels of serotonin are released in the body, leading to symptoms such as agitation, confusion, and changes in blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are neuroleptic and serotonin."},
