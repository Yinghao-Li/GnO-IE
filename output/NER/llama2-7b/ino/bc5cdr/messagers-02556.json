Depression: This is mentioned as a \"disease\" in the paragraph, as it is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities.\n2. Impulsiveness: Impulsivity is also mentioned as a \"disease\" in the paragraph, as it refers to a tendency to act on impulse without fully thinking through the consequences of one's actions.\n3.
