Auditory threshold: This is a measure of the minimum intensity of sound that can be detected by the brain. It is a common measure used to diagnose hearing impairments.\n2. Evoked auditory brain stem response (EABR): This is a diagnostic test used to measure the electrical activity of the brain in response to sound. It is used to detect any abnormalities in the auditory system, including hearing loss or other disorders.\n\nSo, the two \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
