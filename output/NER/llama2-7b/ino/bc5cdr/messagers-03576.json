Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\nIn the paragraph, the following entities are mentioned:\n\n* intragastric pressure\n* muscle fasciculations\n* control group\n* alfentanil group\n2. Determine whether each entity is a disease or not:\n\nBased on the context of the paragraph, we can determine that:\n\n* intragastric pressure is not a disease (it is a measurement)\n* muscle fasciculations are not a disease (they are a symptom)\n* control group is not a disease (it is a group of subjects used for comparison)\n* alfentanil group is a disease (it is a group of subjects treated with alfentanil)\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* alfentanil group\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nDisease entities: alfentanil group"},
