To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Fluorouracil\" is a drug, so it is not a disease entity.\n2. \"cardiotoxicity\" is a disease entity. It refers to damage or poisoning of the heart muscle, which can lead to various cardiovascular problems.\n3. \"induced by\" is a preposition that indicates the cause of the disease entity. In this case, the cause is \"alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine\".\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"cardiotoxicity\"."},
