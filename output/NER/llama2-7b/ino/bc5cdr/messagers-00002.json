Torsade de pointes: This is a type of ventricular arrhythmia, also known as long QT syndrome, which can lead to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.\n2. Ventricular tachycardia: This is a type of arrhythmia that occurs when the ventricles of the heart beat too quickly, often resulting in palpitations or irregular heartbeats.\n3. Fatal arrhythmias: This refers to any type of arrhythmia that can cause sudden death, including ventricular fibrillation and torsade de pointes.\n4. Long QT syndrome: This is a heart rhythm disorder that can lead to irregular heartbeats, including torsade de pointes and ventricular tachycardia.\n\nI hope this helps!
