Dronedarone: Dronedarone is a chemical substance that is used as a medication to treat certain heart rhythm disorders. It works by blocking the action of certain electrical signals in the heart that can cause irregular heartbeats.\n2. Amiodarone: Amiodarone is a chemical substance that is used to treat certain types of irregular heartbeats, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. It works by blocking the action of certain electrical signals in the heart that can cause these irregular heartbeats.\n\nTherefore, both dronedarone and amiodarone are chemical entities that are involved in the regulation of electrical signals in the heart and are classified as antiadrenergic agents."},
