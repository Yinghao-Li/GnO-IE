Identify the noun phrases in the paragraph:\n * rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations\n * severity of anemia\n3. Identify the verbs in the paragraph:\n * observed\n * reduced\n4. Identify the adjectives in the paragraph:\n * significant\n * severe\n5. Based on the above analysis, we can identify the disease entities in the paragraph as:\n * Hemoglobin (noun)\n * anemia (noun)\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"hemoglobin\" and \"anemia\"."},
