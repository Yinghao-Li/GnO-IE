Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. NAFLD is a group of conditions characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver, which can range from simple fatty liver (hepatosteatosis) to more severe forms such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n2.
