Drugs: The paragraph mentions \"2-drug therapy\" which implies that there are two drugs being used.\n2. Liver function tests: The paragraph mentions \"741 batteries of liver function tests\". \"Liver function tests\" is a term that refers to a group of blood tests that are used to evaluate the liver's function.\n3. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK): The paragraph mentions \"714 creatine phosphokinase levels measured\". CPK is an enzyme that is found in muscle tissue, and its levels can be elevated in response to muscle damage or disease.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Drugs (2 drugs)\n* Liver function tests (741 batteries)\n* Creatine phosphokinase (714 levels)"},
