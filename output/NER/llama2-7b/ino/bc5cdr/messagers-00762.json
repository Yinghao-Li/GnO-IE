Anaesthesia: This is a general term for a state of being unconscious or insensible to pain, induced by the administration of a chemical substance (usually a drug).\n2. Induction: This refers to the process of inducing anaesthesia, which is typically done by administering a chemical substance (such as an anesthetic) to the patient.\n3. Emergence: This refers to the period after anaesthesia has been induced, during which the patient begins to regain consciousness.\n4. Variables: This is a general term for any measurable characteristics or quantities, including those related to the body's physiological processes. In this context, the variables being measured are likely related to the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular systems.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
