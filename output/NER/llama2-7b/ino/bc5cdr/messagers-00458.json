Leukocyturia: This is a medical term that refers to the presence of white blood cells in the urine. In the context of the paragraph, it is used to describe a specific type of urine test result that is associated with impaired renal function in HIV-1-infected children treated with indinavir.\n3. Renal function: This refers to the function of the kidneys, which are organs that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood and regulate electrolyte levels. In the context of the paragraph, impaired renal function is a potential side effect of indinavir treatment in HIV-1-infected children.\n\nI hope this helps!
