It refers to damage to the kidneys.\n2. \"peptide antibiotics\" - These are disease entities. They are a type of antibiotic that works by killing bacteria using peptides (short chains of amino acids).\n3. \"aminoglycoside antibiotics\" - These are also disease entities. They are a type of antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial proteins.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Renal damage\n* Peptide antibiotics\n* Aminoglycoside antibiotics"},
