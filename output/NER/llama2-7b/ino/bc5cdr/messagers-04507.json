Amnesia: Amnesia is a condition characterized by the loss of memory, and it is the effect of the apomorphine drug on the brain.\n3. Passive avoidance response: Passive avoidance response is a type of learning in which an organism learns to associate a neutral stimulus with an aversive stimulus, and it is the type of memory that is being studied in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Apomorphine\n* Amnesia\n* Passive avoidance response"},
