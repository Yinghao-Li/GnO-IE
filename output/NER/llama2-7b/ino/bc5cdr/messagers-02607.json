Ecstasy: Also known as MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), it is a synthetic drug that is known to stimulate the release of neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to feelings of euphoria and empathy.\n2. Polydrug: This refers to the use of multiple drugs simultaneously, which can have complex and unpredictable effects on the body and brain.\n3. Cortisol: Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that plays a crucial role in the body's response to stress. It helps regulate blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and the immune system, among other functions.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Ecstasy (MDMA)\n* Polydrug (multiple drugs)\n* Cortisol (hormone)"},
