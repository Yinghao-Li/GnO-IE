It is a manifestation of a underlying disease or condition that affects the visual field.\n3. \"Electing to continue their medication\" is not a disease entity, but rather a patient's decision or action related to their treatment.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"underlying disease or condition that affects the visual field\"."},
