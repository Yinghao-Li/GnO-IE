In this context, the right ventricular pacemaker is a device that was inserted into the heart of each patient during CPR.\n2. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): CPR is a medical procedure that is used to restore a pulse and breathing to a person who has stopped breathing or whose heart has stopped beating. In this context, CPR was performed on each of the patients.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"Right ventricular pacemaker\" and \"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\"."},
