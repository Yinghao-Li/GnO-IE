Learning deterioration: The paragraph states that BCNU administration resulted in deterioration of learning and short-term memory (STM).\n2. Memory impairment: The paragraph specifically mentions that the deterioration of learning and STM is accompanied by decreased hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity.\n3. Neurodegeneration: The paragraph suggests that BCNU administration leads to reduced glutathione (GSH) content in the hippocampus, which is a hallmark of neurodegeneration.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Learning deterioration\n2. Memory impairment\n3. Neurodegeneration"},
