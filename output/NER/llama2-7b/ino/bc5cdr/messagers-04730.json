However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that could be related to diseases:\n\n1. Retained placenta: This is a medical condition where the placenta is not properly expelled from the uterus after childbirth, which can lead to complications such as infection, bleeding, and infertility.\n2. Microg: This is an abbreviation for \"microgram,\" which is a unit of measurement used to express the weight of small quantities of substances. In this context, it is likely that the author is referring to a group of 200 micrograms of something, which could be a biological sample or a substance being tested for disease-causing agents.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph that are related to diseases are:\n\n1. Retained placenta (a medical condition)\n2. Microg (a unit of measurement used to express the weight of small quantities of substances, which could be related to a biological sample or substance being tested for disease-causing agents)."},
