Isotonic sodium chloride: This is a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water, where the concentration of sodium chloride is the same as the concentration of water. Isotonic solutions have the same osmotic pressure as the body's fluids.\n2. Sodium bicarbonate: This is a chemical compound with the formula NaHCO3. It is a base that is commonly used in medical treatment, particularly for acid-base disturbances.\n3. Diltiazem: This is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called calcium channel blockers. It works by relaxing the muscles in the walls of blood vessels, which can help to lower blood pressure and improve blood flow.\n4. Calcium: This is an essential mineral that is important for many bodily functions, including muscle contraction, nerve function, and bone health.\n\nI hope this helps!
