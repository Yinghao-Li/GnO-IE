Chest pain: This is the main symptom mentioned in the paragraph, and it can be caused by various cardiovascular conditions such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia.\n2. Cocaine: This is the drug mentioned in the paragraph that is associated with chest pain. Cocaine is a highly addictive stimulant that can cause a range of cardiovascular problems, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke.\n3. Myocardial infarction (heart attack): This is a type of cardiovascular disease that occurs when the blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked, causing damage to the heart tissue. Chest pain is a common symptom of myocardial infarction.\n4. Pulmonary embolism: This is a blockage in one of the arteries in the lungs, which can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and coughing.\n5. Pneumonia: This is an infection of the lungs that can cause chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Chest pain\n2. Cocaine\n3.
