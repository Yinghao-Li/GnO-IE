Decrease: This is a disease entity because it represents a decrease in a disease or a health condition, which is a common symptom of many diseases.\n3. Implant: This is not a disease entity, but rather a medical device used to treat a disease or a health condition.\n4. Year: This is not a disease entity, but rather a unit of time.\n5.
