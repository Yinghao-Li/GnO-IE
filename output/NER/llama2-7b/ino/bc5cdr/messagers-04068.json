Activity: Activity is a chemical process that occurs in the junctional pacemakers in response to the administration of verapamil. The increase in activity refers to the enhancement of the chemical reactions that occur within the pacemakers.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
