Embryolethality: This refers to the ability of a substance to cause harm or death to an embryo or fetus during development.\n2. Teratogenicity: This refers to the ability of a substance to cause birth defects or abnormalities in an embryo or fetus during development. The specific birth defects mentioned in the paragraph are ventricular septal defects and wavy ribs.\n3.
