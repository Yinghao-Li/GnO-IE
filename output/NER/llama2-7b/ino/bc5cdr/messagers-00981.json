PBSCT - PBSCT stands for \"Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation\", which is a medical procedure that involves transplanting stem cells from the blood into a patient's body. Therefore, \"PBSCT\" is not a chemical entity.\n2. ARI - ARI stands for \"Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease\", which is a complication that can occur after a bone marrow transplant. Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease is caused by the immune system of the donor cells attacking the recipient's body.
