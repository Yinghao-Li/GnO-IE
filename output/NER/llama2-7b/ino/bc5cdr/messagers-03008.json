Mental status: This is a chemical entity because it refers to the cognitive and psychological processes that occur in the brain, which are influenced by chemical reactions and processes.\n3. Complete recovery: This is a chemical entity because it refers to the complete restoration of a chemical process or reaction, such as the recovery of a chemical imbalance or the return to a normal chemical state.\n\nTherefore, the three chemical entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Haemodynamic\n2. Mental status\n3. Complete recovery"},
