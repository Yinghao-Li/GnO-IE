Exercise: This is the external stimulus that triggers the physiological response being studied.\n2. Tachycardia: This is the observed physiological response to exercise, which is an abnormal increase in heart rate.\n3. Beta 1 - receptors: These are specific receptors on the heart that are activated by the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline). Cardioselective drugs block these receptors, while nonselective drugs activate both beta 1 - and beta 2 - receptors.\n4. Beta 2 - receptors: These are specific receptors on the heart that are activated by the hormone corticosteroids. Nonselective drugs block these receptors, while cardioselective drugs activate both beta 1 - and beta 2 - receptors.\n5. Isoproterenol: This is a drug that activates both beta 1 - and beta 2 - receptors.\n6.
