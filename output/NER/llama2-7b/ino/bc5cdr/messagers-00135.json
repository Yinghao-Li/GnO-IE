Identify the types of diseases that can be caused by pathogenic fungi:\n * Fungal infections (e.g., candidemia, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis)\n2. Check if any of the diseases mentioned in step 1 are mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Yes, the paragraph mentions \"pathogenic fungi\" which can cause fungal infections.\n3. Identify the specific disease entity mentioned in the paragraph:\n * The paragraph specifically mentions \"amphotericin B\" as the drug effective against \"pathogenic fungi\".\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is \"fungal infections\"."},
