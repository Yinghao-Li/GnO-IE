Acute hypersensitivity myocarditis\n\nExplanation: Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and hypersensitivity myocarditis is a specific type of myocarditis that occurs due to an allergic reaction. In this case, the diagnosis was made post-mortem, meaning that the cause of death was determined after the person had passed away."},
