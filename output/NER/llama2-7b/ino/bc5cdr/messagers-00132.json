To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Patients\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to individuals who have a specific medical condition.\n2. \"group A\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific subset of patients with a particular condition.\n3. \"2 - year follow - up\" - This is not a disease entity, as it refers to a time period rather than a medical condition.\n4. \"28 %\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific percentage of patients in group A who have died.\n5. \"other three groups\" - This is not a disease entity, as it refers to a general category of patients rather than a specific medical condition.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"Patients\"\n* \"group A\"\n* \"28 %\""},
