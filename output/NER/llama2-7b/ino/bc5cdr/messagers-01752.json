    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the following chemical entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Propranolol: This is a beta blocker, a type of medication that blocks the effects of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) on the body.\n2. Optical isomers: These are two or more molecules that have the same molecular formula but differ in their spatial arrangement of atoms in space. In the context of propranolol, the optical isomers refer to the two different forms of the drug that differ in their optical properties, such as their ability to rotate light.\n3. Beta-blockers: This is a class of medications that block the effects of beta-adrenergic receptors in the body. Beta-blockers are used to treat a variety of conditions, including high blood pressure, heart failure, and certain heart rhythm disorders.\n4. Antiarrhythmics: These are medications that are used to treat abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Antiarrhythmics can be classified into different types, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and sodium channel blockers.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Propranolol\n2. Optical isomers\n3. Beta-blockers\n4. Antiarrhythmics"},
