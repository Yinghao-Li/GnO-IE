Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is discussing the pharmacological characteristics and side effects of a new galenic formulation of propofol, which is a medication used for sedation.\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Propofol: A medication used for sedation.\n * Soyabean oil: A component of the new galenic formulation that is being replaced.\n * Galenic formulation: A formulation of a drug in a specific dosage form, such as a tablet or injection.\n3. Identify the relationships between the entities:\n * Propofol is a medication used for sedation, and the new galenic formulation is a version of propofol without soyabean oil.\n * Soyabean oil is a component of the new galenic formulation that is being replaced.\n4. Identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph:\n * None of the entities mentioned in the paragraph are directly related to a disease. However, propofol is used to treat a variety of medical conditions, such as anxiety, pain, and sedation before medical procedures.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Anxiety\n* Pain\n* Sedation before medical procedures\n\nThese are the entities that propofol is used to treat or manage, rather than the entities mentioned in the paragraph (propofol, soyabean oil, and galenic formulation)."},
