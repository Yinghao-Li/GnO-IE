MSG (Monosodium Glutamate): The paragraph mentions \"mice that received neonatal injections of MSG,\" which is a type of flavor enhancer commonly used in food. However, in the context of the paragraph, MSG is being used as a model for a neurological disorder, as it has been shown to cause seizures in some individuals.\n\nSo, the two \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
