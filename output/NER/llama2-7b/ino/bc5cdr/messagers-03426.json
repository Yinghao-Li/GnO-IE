It refers to a type of neurological disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.\n2. Bradycardia: This is a specific disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. Bradycardia is a condition where the heart rate is abnormally slow, typically below 60 beats per minute. In this case, the patient experienced nifedipine-induced bradycardia.\n3. Nifedipine: This is a medication or drug entity mentioned in the paragraph. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that is used to treat various cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension and angina. In this case, the patient experienced bradycardia after taking nifedipine."},
