Oxidative tubular damage: This is the damage caused to the tubules in the kidneys due to oxidative stress.\n2. VCM-induced nephrotoxicity: This refers to the damage caused to the kidneys due to exposure to a substance called \"VCM\" (which is not specified in the paragraph).\n3. Kidney damage: This is a general term that refers to any type of damage or disorder affecting the kidneys.\n4. Nephrotoxicity: This is a term that refers specifically to the damage caused to the kidneys due to exposure to toxic substances.\n5. Oxidative stress: This is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds.\n\nI hope this helps!

Oxidative stress: This is a biochemical process involving the imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds.\n2. ROS: Reactive oxygen species are highly reactive molecules that can damage cellular components, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Examples of ROS include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical.\n3. VCM: VCM stands for \"vesicatory chemicals,\" which refers to a class of chemicals that can cause damage to the kidneys and other organs.\n4. Erdosteine: This is the name of a specific compound that is mentioned in the paragraph as a modulator of oxidative stress. Erdosteine is a synthetic compound that has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\n5.
