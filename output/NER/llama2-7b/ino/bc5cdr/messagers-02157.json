It stands for \"Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome,\" which is a rare and serious disease that can cause kidney failure and anemia.\n2. \"surgical populations\" is a subgroup of people who have undergone surgery. This subgroup is compared to another subgroup called \"medical populations.\"\n3. \"medical populations\" is another subgroup of people who have not undergone surgery.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HIT)\n* Surgical populations\n* Medical populations"},
