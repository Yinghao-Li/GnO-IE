Ca (2+) overload: This refers to an abnormal accumulation of calcium ions (Ca2+) in cells or tissues, which can lead to various diseases such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps, and neurological disorders.\n2. Aconitine: Aconitine is a toxic alkaloid that can cause a range of adverse effects, including muscle weakness, tremors, and cardiac arrhythmias. It is also known to affect the expression of Ca (2+) handling proteins.\n\nSo, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is Ca (2+) overload, and the disease-related protein mentioned is aconitine."},
