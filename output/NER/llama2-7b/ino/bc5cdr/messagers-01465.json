Identify the keywords:\n * Laboratory data\n * Plasma electrolyte\n * Ammonia\n * Leukocytosis\n2. Determine the relationships between the keywords:\n * Laboratory data is related to the results of medical tests performed in a laboratory.\n * Plasma electrolyte and ammonia are related to the levels of these substances in the blood.\n * Leukocytosis is a condition where there is an abnormal increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood.\n3. Identify the disease entities:\n * Based on the relationships between the keywords, we can identify the following disease entities:\n  + Leukocytosis: This is the disease entity that is being described in the paragraph. It is characterized by an abnormal increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is \"Leukocytosis\"."},
