Identify the entities:\n * \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n  + AmB (a substance)\n  + NS-718 (a substance)\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"AmB\" and \"NS-718\"."},

Blood: This refers to the fluid component of the circulatory system that carries oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells and removes waste products.\n3. Urea: This is a chemical compound that is produced in the liver as a result of the breakdown of amino acids. It is present in the blood and urine.\n4. Creatinine: This is a chemical compound that is produced in the muscles and kidneys and is present in the blood and urine.\n5. D - AmB: This is a chemical compound that is mentioned in the paragraph as the substance that was infused into the rats. It is likely a drug or toxin, but without more information, it is difficult to identify it with certainty.\n6. NS - 718: This is another chemical compound that was not infused into the rats in the study. Again, without more information, it is difficult to identify it with certainty.\n\nI hope this helps!
