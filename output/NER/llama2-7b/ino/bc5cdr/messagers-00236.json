Cocaine: Cocaine is a drug that can cause significant changes in hemodynamics, leading to cardiovascular problems and other adverse effects.\n2. Hemodynamics: Hemodynamics refers to the movement of blood throughout the body, including blood pressure, heart rate, and blood flow. Changes in hemodynamics can be indicative of various diseases or conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or shock.\n3. Cardiovascular disease: Cardiovascular disease refers to any disease or condition that affects the cardiovascular system, including the heart and blood vessels. Cocaine use can lead to cardiovascular problems, such as hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n4. Shock: Shock is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to the body's tissues. Cocaine use can cause shock, particularly in high doses or in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.\n\nTherefore, the entities identified in the paragraph as \"Disease\" are:\n\n1. Cocaine\n2. Hemodynamics\n3. Cardiovascular disease\n4. Shock"},
