Disease: The disease mentioned in the paragraph is \"nephrotoxicity,\" which is damage to the kidneys.\n2. ED: ED stands for \"experimental autoimmune nephritis,\" which is a type of autoimmune disease that affects the kidneys.\n3. MAP kinases: MAP kinases are enzymes that play a role in signal transduction pathways, which are involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation.\n4. NF-κB: NF-κB stands for \"nuclear factor kappa B,\" which is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune responses.\n\nSo, the entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Nephrotoxicity (disease)\n* ED (disease)\n* MAP kinases (enzymes)\n* NF-κB (transcription factor)"},
