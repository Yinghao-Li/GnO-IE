To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Hepatocellular pattern of damage\" - This is a disease entity. It refers to damage to the liver cells (hepatocytes).\n2. \"Inversely correlated with age\" - This is a relationship between two variables, where the correlation is negative (i.e., as age increases, the frequency of the disease entity decreases).\n3. \"Worst outcome\" - This is a disease entity. It refers to the poorest possible outcome for a patient with the disease, in this case, as determined by the Cox regression analysis.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hepatocellular pattern of damage\n2. Worst outcome\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
