ECG (Electrocardiogram) - a medical test that measures the electrical activity of the heart\n2.

ECG is a medical test that measures the electrical activity of the heart, which is a physical entity.\n2. Conduction defects are a type of heart condition that affects the electrical signals that control the heart's rhythm.
