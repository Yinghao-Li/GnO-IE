Valproate-induced encephalopathy: This is a condition where the drug valproate (also known as valproic acid) causes damage to the brain, leading to a range of symptoms including cognitive impairment, seizures, and behavioral changes.\n2. NMDA receptor-associated encephalitis: This is a type of inflammatory brain disorder that is caused by the immune system attacking the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the brain. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, and in this context, it is caused by an immune-mediated response.\n\nSo, in summary, the two \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are valproate-induced encephalopathy and NMDA receptor-associated encephalitis."},
