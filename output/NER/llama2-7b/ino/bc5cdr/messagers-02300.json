It refers to abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood.\n2. Renal disease: The paragraph mentions that the patients have renal disease, which means they have kidney problems.\n3. Hyperparathyroidism: The paragraph mentions that the patients have hyperparathyroidism, which is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). This can lead to high levels of calcium in the blood.\n4. Vitamin D deficiency: The paragraph mentions that the patients have vitamin D deficiency, which can also contribute to high levels of calcium in the blood.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
