Azathioprine: This is a medication or drug that is used to treat certain diseases, including autoimmune disorders and organ transplant rejection.\n2. Annexin V binding: This refers to the binding of a protein called annexin V to certain cells or molecules, which can be indicative of certain diseases or conditions.\n3. Forward scatter: This refers to the scattering of light by cells or particles, which can be used to assess cellular properties and can be affected by certain diseases or conditions.\n4.
