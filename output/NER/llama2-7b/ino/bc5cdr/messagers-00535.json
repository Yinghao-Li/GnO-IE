Adenosine: This is a purine nucleoside that acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain.\n2. Agonists: These are chemicals that bind to a receptor and activate it, leading to a response. In this context, adenosine receptor agonists are chemicals that bind to adenosine receptors and activate them.\n3. Amphetamine: This is a synthetic drug that is commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n4.
