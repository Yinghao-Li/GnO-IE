Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These are a class of drugs that are commonly used to reduce inflammation and pain. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen.\n2. Pilocarpine: This is a chemical substance that is used to produce seizures in rats. It is a cholinergic agonist, which means it activates the same receptors as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
