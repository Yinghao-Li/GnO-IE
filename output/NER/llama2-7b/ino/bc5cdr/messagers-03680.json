Bone marrow transplantation: This is a medical procedure that involves transplanting healthy bone marrow cells into a patient's body to replace damaged or diseased bone marrow.\n2. Immunosuppression: This is a condition where the body's immune system is weakened or suppressed, making it difficult for the body to fight infections and diseases.\n3. Cyclophosphamide (CYA): This is a medication used to treat various types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. It is also used to prevent rejection in organ transplant patients.\n4. Leukemia: This is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by abnormal white blood cell production.\n5. Lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, specifically the lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues.\n6. Multiple myeloma: This is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood, characterized by the excessive production of abnormal plasma cells.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Bone marrow transplantation\n2. Immunosuppression\n3. Leukemia\n4. Lymphoma\n5. Multiple myeloma"},
