To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Trimethaphan\" is a drug or treatment that is causing the hypotension (low blood pressure) in the rats. Therefore, \"trimethaphan\" is a disease entity.\n2. \"Hypotension\" is the main disease entity in the paragraph, as it is the condition that is being studied.\n3. \"Bradycardia\" is a disease entity, as it is a abnormal heart rate (<60 beats per minute) in this case.\n4. \"Tachycardia\" is also a disease entity, as it is an abnormal heart rate (>100 beats per minute) in this case.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Trimethaphan\n* Hypotension\n* Bradycardia\n* Tachycardia"},
