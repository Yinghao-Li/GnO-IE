Creatinine: This is a chemical compound that is produced in the body and excreted by the kidneys.\n2. Clearance: This is a term used to describe the rate at which a substance is removed from the body, in this case, creatinine.\n3. Curve: A curve is a graphical representation of a set of data over time. In this context, the curve refers to the time-course curve of creatinine clearance.\n4. AMNS: This stands for \"alone,\" indicating that the group being compared to the control group is only receiving AMNS (whatever that is) and no other substances.\n5. PS: This stands for \"alone,\" indicating that the group being compared to the control group is only receiving PS (whatever that is) and no other substances.\n6. Saline: This refers to a solution of salt water, which is used as a control in the experiment.\n7. P: This stands for \"p-value,\" which is a statistical measure used to determine the significance of the results.
