Mesangial dysfunction: This refers to any abnormality or dysfunction of the mesangium, which is the layer of cells between the glomerular capillaries and the Bowman's capsule in the kidney.\n2. Glomerular sclerosis: This refers to the hardening or thickening of the glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessels in the kidney that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mesangial dysfunction\n2. Glomerular sclerosis"},

Puromycin: This is the chemical compound used in the study, specifically the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) model.\n2. Aminonucleoside: This is a subcategory of nucleosides, which are the building blocks of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Puromycin is an aminonucleoside, meaning it contains an amino group (-NH2) attached to the sugar molecule.\n3. Nucleic acids: The study mentions nucleic acids, which are the molecules that contain the genetic instructions for living organisms. DNA and RNA are the two main types of nucleic acids.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
