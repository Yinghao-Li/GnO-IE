Inorganic arsenic poisoning (specifically, iAs)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Arsenic poisoning: Arsenic is a toxic substance that can cause a range of health problems, including poisoning, if ingested in high amounts. Prolonged exposure to arsenic can lead to various health issues, such as skin discoloration, nerve damage, and increased risk of cancer.\n2. Inorganic arsenic poisoning (iAs): Inorganic arsenic is a specific type of arsenic that is found in drinking water and other sources. Prolonged exposure to iAs can also cause health problems, including increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are Arsenic poisoning and Inorganic arsenic poisoning (iAs)."},
