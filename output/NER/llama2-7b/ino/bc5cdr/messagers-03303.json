Acute myocardial ischemic injury: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a type of heart attack caused by a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle.\n2. Myocardial ischemia: This is a related term to the disease entity \"Acute myocardial ischemic injury.\" Myocardial ischemia refers to a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, which can lead to damage or injury to the heart tissue.\n3. Ischemia: This is a broader term that refers to a reduction in blood flow to a particular tissue or organ. In the context of the paragraph, ischemia refers to the reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle.\n4. Heart attack: This is a broader term that refers to any type of injury or damage to the heart muscle. Acute myocardial ischemic injury is a type of heart attack that occurs suddenly and can be caused by a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle.\n\nI hope this helps!
