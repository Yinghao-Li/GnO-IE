Nitric oxide (NO): This is the main entity mentioned in the paragraph, a gaseous neurotransmitter that has a contradictory role in epileptogenesis.\n2. L-arginine: This is a precursor of NO synthesis, which means it is a substance that the body uses to produce nitric oxide.\n3. L-NAME (NOS inhibitor): This is a substance that inhibits the activity of an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which is responsible for producing nitric oxide.\n4. epileptogenesis: This is the process by which seizures or epilepsy develops.\n5. epilepsy models: These are experimental models used to study epilepsy in a controlled laboratory setting.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are epilepsy and epileptogenesis."},
