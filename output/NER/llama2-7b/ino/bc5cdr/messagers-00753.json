    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Dosage was increased\" - This sentence refers to a specific medical action, so it is not a disease entity.\n2. \"from 2 . 5 mg b . d . to 5 mg b . d .\" - This sentence refers to the dosage of a medication, so it is not a disease entity.\n3. \"at 4 weeks\" - This sentence refers to the time frame in which the dosage was increased, so it is not a disease entity.\n4. \"in patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg\" - This sentence refers to a specific patient population, so it is a disease entity. Diastolic blood pressure is a measure of blood pressure, and a reading of greater than 90 mmHg indicates hypertension.\n5. \"and their further response was greater than those remaining on 2 . 5 mg b . d .\" - This sentence refers to the comparison of the response of patients who received the increased dosage with those who did not receive the increased dosage, so it is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"hypertension\"."},
