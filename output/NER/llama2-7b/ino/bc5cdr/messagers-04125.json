Hyperprolactinemia: This is a condition where the level of prolactin in the blood is higher than normal.\n2. Pituitary dysfunction: The paragraph mentions that the pituitary response to LH-RH (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) is abolished in the patients receiving haloperidol infusions. This suggests that there is a problem with the pituitary gland, which is responsible for regulating various hormonal functions in the body.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hyperprolactinemia\n2. Pituitary dysfunction"},
