Gentamicin: This is the drug or toxin that is being administered to the rats in the study.\n2. Nephritis: This is a type of kidney disease characterized by inflammation and damage to the kidney tissues. The paragraph mentions that the rats were injected with gentamicin, which can cause nephritis in some cases.\n3. Tubular transporters: These are proteins that are involved in the transport of substances across the cell membranes of the kidney tubules. The paragraph mentions that the expression of these transporters was determined in the rats after they were injected with gentamicin.\n\nI hope this helps!
