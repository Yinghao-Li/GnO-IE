It can include various diseases or disorders that affect the kidneys, such as chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, and kidney failure.\n2. \"Kidney disease\" is a more specific term that refers to a specific condition or disorder that affects the kidneys. It can include a range of conditions, such as diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and polycystic kidney disease.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, \"Disease\" can refer to either \"kidney syndromes\" or \"kidney disease,\" depending on the context."},
