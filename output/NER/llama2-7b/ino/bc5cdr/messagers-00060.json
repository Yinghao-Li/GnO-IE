Aplastic anemia: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells.\n2. Acquired aplastic anemia: This is a subtype of aplastic anemia that is acquired, meaning it is not present at birth but develops later in life.\n3. HBMP cells: These are the cells that are affected by the mechanism underlying aplastic anemia, specifically the HBMP2 cells, which are a type of stem cell that produces blood cells in the bone marrow.\n\nI hope this helps!
