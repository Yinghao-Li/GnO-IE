Investigations\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Heart: The term \"heart\" refers to a bodily organ that is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. It is a chemical entity as it is made up of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to perform its functions.\n2. Failure: The term \"failure\" refers to the inability of the heart to pump blood effectively. It is a chemical entity as it is a dysfunction or abnormality in the heart's ability to perform its normal functions.\n3. Chronic: The term \"chronic\" refers to a long-term or persistent condition. It is a chemical entity as it is a characteristic of the heart failure that persists over time.\n4. Heart failure: The term \"heart failure\" refers to a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It is a chemical entity as it is a dysfunction or abnormality in the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.\n5. Investigations: The term \"investigations\" refers to the process of studying or examining something in detail. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the process of studying the heart and its functions in order to understand the mechanisms of heart failure. It is a chemical entity as it is a process that involves the use of chemicals or chemical reactions to understand the underlying mechanisms of a disease or condition."},

Failure: The term \"failure\" refers to the inability of the heart to pump blood effectively. It is a chemical entity as it is a dysfunction or abnormality in the heart's ability to perform its normal functions, which is related to chemical processes in the body."},
