    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the term \"Disease\" is not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the context, we can identify the following disease entities:\n\n1. Proteinuria: This is the disease entity being studied in the paragraph. Proteinuria refers to the presence of excess protein in the urine, which can be an indicator of various kidney diseases.\n2. Nephrotic syndrome: This is a group of symptoms that include proteinuria, along with other symptoms such as edema (swelling), hyperlipidemia (elevated levels of fats in the blood), and hypoproteinemia (low levels of protein in the blood).\n3. Kidney disease: The paragraph mentions that Temocapril did not attenuate proteinuria at 8 days, but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20. This suggests that the disease being studied is a kidney disease that causes proteinuria, and that Temocapril is being used to treat or manage the disease.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and kidney disease."},
