Therapy discontinuation: The paragraph mentions that therapy is discontinued when the Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction is greater than or equal to 40%. This implies that the discontinuation of therapy is a result of the disease or condition being treated.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
