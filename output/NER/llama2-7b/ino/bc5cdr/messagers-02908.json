TLS is a complication that can occur in patients with cancer, particularly those with rapidly growing tumors, and is caused by the sudden release of electrolytes and waste products from the tumor cells.\n2. Renal replacement therapy (RRT): This is the treatment mentioned in the paragraph, which is used to replace the function of the kidneys in patients who have lost kidney function due to disease or injury. In this case, the patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), which is a type of RRT that involves filtering the blood continuously using a machine.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)\n2. Renal replacement therapy (RRT)"},
