Identify the keywords: In the paragraph, the keyword \"disease\" is mentioned.\n2. Identify the noun phrases: Break down the sentence into noun phrases, which are groups of words that function as a single unit in the sentence. In this case, the noun phrases are:\n * \"Azotemia\"\n * \"episodes\"\n3. Identify the entities: For each noun phrase, identify the entity it represents. In this case, the entities are:\n * \"Azotemia\" - a disease entity\n * \"episodes\" - a disease entity\n4. Classify the entities: Based on the information provided in the paragraph, classify each disease entity into a category. In this case, the category is \"Disease\".\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Azotemia (Disease)\n* Episodes (Disease)\n\nI hope this helps!
