Since the open - circuit voltage V oc of bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs is positively correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , a higher V oc for PzNDTDTBObased polymer solar cells could be anticipated due to the lowerlying HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO. 24 Photovoltaic Properties. To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the NDT - based semiconductor , PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated.

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you identify the values of material properties in the paragraph!\n\n1. HOMO energy level:\nThe paragraph mentions that the HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO is 0.15 eV lower than that of PzNDTDTBT. Therefore, the HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO is 0.15 eV = 150 meV.\n2.

However, it is mentioned that the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs is positively correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer.
