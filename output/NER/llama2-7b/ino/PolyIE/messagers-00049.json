This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation. Additionally , compared to a single thiophene ring , it must be pointed out that due to the large resonance stabilization energy of BDT , the delocalization of electrons from the BDT unit into the backbone is less favorable than from the thiophene ring. As a result , a more stable copolymer with high performance can be obtained by using BDT as the core unit.

Solubility:\nThe paragraph mentions that the solubilizing group orientation is a promising building block in n-type polymers. This suggests that the materials mentioned in the paragraph are soluble in a solvent.\n4. Crystallinity:\nThe paragraph does not mention the crystallinity of any material directly. However, it does mention that the fused-ring building blocks are widely used in the synthesis of conjugated polymers, which suggests that the materials mentioned in the paragraph may be crystalline.\n5. Molecular weight:\nThe paragraph does not mention the molecular weight of any material directly. However, it does mention that the large planar benzodithiophene (BDT) unit has emerged as an attractive building block for conjugated polymers.

Ionization potential (IP):\nThe paragraph mentions that the incorporation of the benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene (BDT) unit into the copolymer backbone increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation. This suggests that the IP of the materials mentioned in the paragraph may be relatively high.\n7. Hole transport distance:\nThe paragraph does not mention the hole transport distance of any material directly.
