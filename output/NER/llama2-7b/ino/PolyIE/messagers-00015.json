The best devices of PDTP-BT and PDTP - DTBT show PCE of 1.64% and 2.37% , respectively. The polymer PDTP-DT2BT exhibits the highest PCE of 3.12% , ascribed to the largest J SC = 11.43 mA cm^-2 with a slightly lower V OC of 0.54 V and a slightly higher FF of 0.57 than the other polymers. The V OC values of the devices are around 0.5 V , suggesting that the addition of the thienyl units does not affect the main chain distortion. This coincides well with similar HOMO energy levels for the copolymers measured by CV. These results indicate that the PCEs of the photovoltaic devices based on PDTP-DT2BT : PC 70 BM were higher than those of PDTP - DTBT : PC 70 BM and PDTP-BT : PC 70 BM. Overall , it is an effective approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - based copolymers by increasing the number of unsubstituted thienyl units along the copolymers backbone. Fig. 5 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) plots of the devices based on three copolymer : PC 70 BM combinations under the illumination of monochromatic light. With the increase of thienyl spacers , the EQE response wavelengths show a blue shift , a similar tendency to the absorption spectra , but the EQE peak values were higher in PDTP-DT2BT ( 58% ) compared to PDTP-BT ( 23% ) or PDTP - DTBT ( 42% ). The shapes of the EQE curves of the devices in the range of 450-700 nm could be assigned to the stronger absorption of PC 70 BM . In conclusion , three low band gap D-A copolymers , based on the DTP donor and the BT acceptor , with different numbers of thienyl spacers along the backbone have been designed and synthesized. The thienyl spacer makes the absorption spectra peak blue - shift in the longer wavelength range and red - shift in the low wavelength range. Under 1.5 G^100 mW cm^-2 illumination , a best PCE of 3.12% for PDTP-DT2BT was recorded , with V OC = 0.48 V , J SC = 11.43 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.57. Although the best PCE is still not high enough for commercial use , our optimization by designing suitable molecular structures , selecting different solvents and changing other factors could provide useful information for further studies of the commercialized PSCs .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
