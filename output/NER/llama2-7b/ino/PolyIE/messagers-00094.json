The calculated I SC from the EQE was 15% less than the measured I SC . This discrepancy might be attributed to the spectral mismatch in the NIR region and / or device degradation during measurements in air. The highest PCE of PSCs based on the PDTP-DTDPP-(Bu) : PC 70 BM system reached 2.71% , which was lower than the 4-5 % of the P3HT : PCBM devices. This could be mainly attributed to the lower V OC ( ∼ 0.4 V ). In addition , the charge separation efficiency in the current combination might not be as high as that in P3HT : PCBM , although it was difficult to estimate the internal quantum efficiency ( IQE ) accurately due to the light interference effect in the films. This might be attributed to the smaller LUMO offset or less ideal mixing morphology between the polymer and PCBM. Nevertheless , this performance is more than double of the highest PCE ( 1.1% ) reported to date for μmR - polymers , even when the spectral mismatch in the NIR region above was considered. Such improvement of PCE comes from relatively highefficiency photon - to - electron conversion in the broad range of the absorption in the blend film of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM. Considering the high EQE obtained in the range from 650 to 950 nm , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) is a promising candidate for applications in tandem photovoltaic devices in combination with conventional visible light absorbing materials. Furthermore , comparing the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) with PDTP - DTDPP(EH) suggests that the alkyl chain in the DPP segment has a large influence on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers.

The energy loss from the low output voltage of the photovoltaic devices ( 0.38 - 0.4 V ) can be attributed to the relatively large difference between the LUMO levels of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM ( i.e. , small energy difference between the HOMO of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and LUMO of PCBM ). There is still a room to lower the LUMO level of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) from 3.63 to ∼ 4.0 eV , which is ∼ 0.3 eV higher than the LUMO level of PCBM.
