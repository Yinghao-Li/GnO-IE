The newly developed DTPD moiety was carefully designed to lower a band gap via strong interaction between donor - acceptor moieties and keep polymer energy levels deep.

Solar cell devices were fabricated according to the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / photoactive ( polymer : PC 70 BM ) / TiO 2 / Al.
