The electrochemical properties of PCDSeBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). As shown in Figure 1b , PCDSeBT exhibits clear reversible n - doping / dedoping processes in the negative potential range , whereas quasi-reversible p - doping / dedoping behaviors in the positive potential range are observed. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be -5.40 eV and -3.70 eV , respectively , using the ferrocene - ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc+ ) redox couple ( 4.8 eV below the vacuum level ). Both PCDTBT and PCDSeBT have nearly identical HOMO energy levels , but PCDSeBT exhibits 0.10 eV lower - lying LUMO level relative to PCDTBT ( LUMO = -3.60 eV , see also Supporting Information ) , 5a verifying our presumption aforementioned about the effect of selenium on the selective fine - tuning of LUMO level. The material - design rules described by Scharber et al. 19 suggested that the PCEs of a BHJ solar cell should be much more sensitive to changes of the donor LUMO level compared to variations of the donor bandgap. On the basis of the rules , the estimated PCE from the E g opt and the LUMO value of PCDSeBT is 7.8% . This theoretical value is much higher than that of PCDTBT ( 6.5% ) , indicating that a highly promising material for PSCs considering the frontier orbital energies. Upon utilizing a model dimeric system containing methyl groups , the optimized molecular geometry of PCDSeBT and its frontier molecular orbitals of the calculated HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces were computed by density functional theory ( DFT , B3LYP / 6-31G ) ( Figure 1d ). The HOMO of PCDSeBT is well - distributed along the conjugated chains ; its LUMO is mainly centralized on BT accepting core as shaped by orbital lobes , being predicted a p - type organic semiconductor. In order to corroborate the effect of the heteroatom substitution on charge transporting properties of the polymers , top - contact organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) were fabricated using solution processed PCDTBT and PCDSeBT , respectively , as the semiconducting layer on the octadecyltrichlorosilane ( OTS ) self - assembled monolayer (SAM)-modified Si / SiO 2 substrates ( see the detailed devices fabrication in the Experimental Section ).\n\nLet's think step by step."},
