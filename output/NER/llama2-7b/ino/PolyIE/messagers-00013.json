Table 1 shows the optical band - gaps ( E opt g ) of all polymers estimated from the corresponding UV - vis absorption onset. PDTP-DT2BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-BT have optical band gaps of 1.61 , 1.46 and 1.41 eV , respectively , which are close to the ideal value of 1.5 eV for PSC application.

The optimized structures show that all the polymer backbones are mostly planar. Time dependent DFT calculations show that the absorption band in the longer wavelength is mainly attributed to the transition from HOMO delocalized in the D-A backbone to LUMO localized in DTP units for all the polymers. On the other hand , the absorption in the shorter wavelength is largely contributed by the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1 , which is similar to π-π* transition in polythiophene judging by the shape of the orbitals. Therefore , the introduction of more thienyl spacer could stabilize LUMO+1 ( π* ) due to the better conjugation , resulting in the red - shift of the absorption band.
