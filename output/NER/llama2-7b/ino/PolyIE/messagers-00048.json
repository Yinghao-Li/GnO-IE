Conjugated polymers can be classified as hole ( p - type ) or electron ( n - type ) transporting materials according to the type of orderly transferring charge carriers. Most of conjugated polymers are p - type semiconductors that have seen a dramatic rise in performance over the past decade while much less attention has been devoted to n - type semiconducting polymers that have lagged behind their p - type counterparts. 2 Organic n - type materials are essential for the fabrication of organic p-n junctions , OPVs , n-channel OFETs , OLEDs , and complementary logic circuits. 3 The n - type building blocks are the core components in n - type semiconducting polymers. Aromatic imides such as rylene diimides are one of the classical n - type building blocks and can exhibit relatively high electron affinities , high electron mobilities , and excellent chemical , thermal , and photochemical stabilities. 4 These materials are electron deficient due to the substitution of an aromatic core with one or two sets of π-accepting imide groups that are mutually conjugated.
