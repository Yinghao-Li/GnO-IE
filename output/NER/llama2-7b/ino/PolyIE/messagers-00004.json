In thin films , PffBB-n showed three major absorption bands with the high - energy absorption peaked at ∼ 430 nm and two overlapped and strong absorptions peaked at ∼ 620 and 680 nm. In solution , the first two absorption peaks blue - shift to 380-420 and 520-560 nm , respectively , and the third absorption is highly temperature - dependent which becomes a shoulder peak at high temperature. Therefore , the absorption band located in the high energy region was attributed to π-π* transitions , whereas the broad absorption at around 560 nm corresponded to the intramolecular charge transfer band and the long - wavelength absorption emerged at ∼ 680 nm was due to the polymer interchain stacking aggregation.

The incorporation of an alkyl side chain can often render a better solubility of a polymer ; however , the long alkyl side chain can exert stronger alkyl-alkyl chain interactions that can give rise to a strong aggregation of polymer chains.
