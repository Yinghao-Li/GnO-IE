The polymer has high molecular weight , good solubility , and a broad absorption spectrum in the range of 500-1100 nm. Field effect transistor charge mobility of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) arrived 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Bulk heterojunction type polymer solar cells based on PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PC 70 BM have broad photocurrent response wavelength range from 300 nm to 1.1 μm. High short - circuit current ( 14.87 mA / cm^2 ) and power conversion efficiency ( 2.71% ) were achieved , which is a significant advance for efficient photovoltaic polymers that respond to the whole range of the solar spectrum . In the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have received a great deal of attention as a potential renewable energy source due to their potential advantages such as low fabrication cost , light weight , and fast production of large area devices by roll - to - roll solution processes. 1 Among photovoltaic polymers , regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) has been extensively studied. Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) photovoltaic device combining P3HT as the electron donor with [6,6]-phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) as the electron acceptor have achieved power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as high as 4-5 % . 2 However , the upper limit seems to have been reached for this material combination , as P3HT utilizes only photons located in the highenergy fraction of the solar spectrum with wavelengths below 650 nm. In fact , ∼ 40% of the total solar energy lies in the range of 650-1100 nm , which is a strong driving force for developing lowbandgap polymers to utilize the solar energy in the near - infrared ( NIR ) range. 3 Recently , significant progress has been made in the photovoltaic application of novel low - bandgap polymers with optical absorption wavelengths in the range of 700-900 nm. 4 Nevertheless , design of efficient photovoltaic polymers with optical absorption and photocurrent response extending to wavelengths of micrometers remains challenging.
