The target poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-diselenienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDSeBT ) was obtained by Suzuki polymerization of M1 and M2 in degassed toluene / water with K 3 PO 4 as an organic base , Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 as a catalyst , and P(o-tol) 3 as the corresponding ligand at 90 °C for 3 days. The crude polymer was purified by reprecipitation and Soxhlet extraction with methanol , acetone , hexane , and chlorobenzene. Details of synthesis of monomers , polymerization , and their characterizations are given in the Experimental Section. After purification , gel - permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis against PS standard exhibits a number - averaged molecular mass ( M n ) of 83^000 g / mol with a polydispersity ( PDI ) of 2.51. The polymer is readily soluble in common solvents such as chloroform , toluene , THF , and chlorobenzene. As shown in Figure 1a , the UV - vis absorption spectra of PCDSeBT both in chloroform solution and solid state exhibit two distinct absorption bands , as typically observed for donor (D)-acceptor ( A ) low bandgap materials. The absorption maxima ( λ max ) of the film are located at 403 and 589 nm. The shorter absorption band is due to π-π* transitions of the polymer backbone , 13 while the lower - energy peak is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) in the electron - rich and electron - deficient units. 14 It is worth noting that the maxima absorption values of PCDSeBT in the film are slightly broadened without any obvious red - shift when compared to the solution. This verifies that only a small reorganization via π-π stacking between the polymer chains is within view during the film formation because of the interchain aggregates in solution. 15 This observation is in contrast to many conjugated polymers , in which there is a red - shift that occurs in going from the solution to the solid state due to the aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state , 3,16 even the PCDTBT film is red - shifted by 30 nm vs solution. 5a Besides , the deep blue color of PCDSeBT solution is observed unlike the red color of PCDTBT in solution ( see the digital photograph in Figure 1a ).
