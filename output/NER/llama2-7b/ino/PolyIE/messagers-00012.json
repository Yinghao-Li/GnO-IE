In this regard , a simple and effective method might be to tune the properties of D-A type photovoltaic polymers by introducing thienyl groups as spacers between donor and acceptor segments in the backbone. In this study , three kinds of low band gap copolymers integrating DTP as the donor block and the most - used BT as the acceptor unit were synthesized. Different numbers of thienyl ( T ) as spacers were introduced along the copolymer main chain to investigate the effect on optical , electrochemical and photovoltaic performance. [6,6]-Phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) was used as an acceptor in the blended film of copolymers : PC 70 BM. Different solvents ( chlorobenzene ( CB ) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) ) were tested to build an optimized interpenetrated network in the active film , and the corresponding film properties and the photovoltaic device performance are discussed in detail .

The absorption maximum wavelength in the solutions and the films and the optical band gap deduced from the absorption onsets are summarized in Table 1. Judging from the splitting of the absorption bands , it can be speculated that the polymers have the typical absorption characteristics of D-A type copolymers with π-π* and charge transfer - type transitions. Comparing the polymers PDTP-BT and PDTP-DT2BT with the previously synthesized polymer PDTP - DTBT , 27 the difference in their absorption is distinct.
