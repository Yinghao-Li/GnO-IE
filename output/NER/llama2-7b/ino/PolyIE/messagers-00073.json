Therefore , the spacers consist of thiophene or bithiophene functionalized with various alkyl side chains were introduced in between IDT and NT units to improve the solubility of the resulting polymers , which may also potentially lead to improved molecular weight that is favorable for the optimal morphology and charge carrier transport. 39-41 We notice that the incorporated side chains may also increase the dihedral angle of their contiguous aromatic units , 42,43 which may somewhat inhibit polymer backbone planarity and thereby increase band gap and lower the charge carrier mobility. 40,41 However , it should be tried several different alkyl side chains to achieve a delicate balance of the molecular weight , solubility as well as planarity of polymers as no comprehensive rule has yet emerged of the influences of specific side chains. 44,45 It was realized that by switching the spacer between the IDT and NT units , the processability , backbone planarity , charge carrier mobility and film morphology can be optimized.
