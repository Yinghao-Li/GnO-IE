To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"heterozygous deficiency\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a genetic disorder where an individual has a deficiency in a particular gene due to a mutation in one of the copies of the gene.\n2. \"FH family\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a group of genetic disorders that are characterized by a deficiency in the function of proteins involved in the metabolism of fatty acids.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Heterozygous deficiency\n2. FH family (which includes several specific disorders, such as familial hypercholesterolemia)"},
