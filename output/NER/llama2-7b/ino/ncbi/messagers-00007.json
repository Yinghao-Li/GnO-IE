To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"T-PLL\" - This is a disease entity, which stands for \"T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.\"\n2. \"mutated\" - This is an attribute of the disease entity \"T-PLL,\" indicating that the disease has undergone a genetic mutation.\n3. \"A-T allele\" - This is another disease entity, which stands for \"A-T allele,\" a specific genetic mutation that has been identified in some cases of T-PLL.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* T-PLL\n* mutated T-PLL\n* A-T allele"},
