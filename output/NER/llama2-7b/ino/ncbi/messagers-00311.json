However, based on the context, we can identify the following disease entities:\n\n1. PAX6 mutations: PAX6 is a gene that plays a crucial role in the development of several tissues, including the eyes, ears, and limbs. Mutations in the PAX6 gene can lead to a variety of congenital disorders, including Waardenburg syndrome, distichiasis, and ocular coloboma.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"PAX6 mutations\" or \"PAX6-related disorders\"."},
