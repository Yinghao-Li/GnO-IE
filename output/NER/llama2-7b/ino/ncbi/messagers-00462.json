Mutations in the WT1 gene have been found to be a common cause of this cancer.\n2. Dax - 1: Dax - 1 is a gene that is associated with various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. Mutations in the Dax - 1 gene have been found to be associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly in the testis.\n3. SF - 1: SF - 1 is a gene that is associated with a rare genetic disorder called Smith - Fineman - Myers - Progeria Syndrome (SFM). This disorder is characterized by accelerated aging and a shortened lifespan.\n\nSo, in summary, the paragraph suggests that WT1 and Dax - 1 are involved in a functional opposition in testis development, and that SF - 1 is a gene that is involved in a rare genetic disorder."},
