To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Individuals\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a group of people who share a common characteristic (in this case, having mutations in either region 2 or region 3).\n2. \"mutations\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a change in the DNA sequence of an individual's genome that can lead to disease.\n3. \"region 1\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific location in the genome where mutations can occur.\n4. \"region 2\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific location in the genome where mutations can occur.\n5. \"region 3\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific location in the genome where mutations can occur.\n6. \"adenomas\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a type of tumor that can occur in the colon.\n7. \"tended to be lower\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a tendency or trend towards a certain outcome (in this case, a lower average number of adenomas in individuals with mutations in either region 2 or region 3 compared to individuals with mutations in region 1).\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Individuals\n* Mutations\n* Region 1\n* Region 2\n* Region 3\n* Adenomas"},

Here are the disease entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. \"mutations\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a change in the DNA sequence of an individual's genome that can lead to disease.\n2. \"adenomas\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a type of tumor that can occur in the colon.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Mutations\n* Adenomas"},
