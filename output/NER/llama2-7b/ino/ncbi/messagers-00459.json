WT1: Wilms' tumor 1 is a gene that is associated with various cancers, including osteosarcoma and leukemia.\n2. KTS: KTS is an abbreviation for \"kinase-insertion-type sarcoma,\" which is a type of sarcoma that is characterized by the insertion of a kinase gene into a non-coding region of the genome.\n3. SF-1: SF-1 is an abbreviation for \"steroidogenic factor 1,\" which is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis.\n4. MIS: MIS is an abbreviation for \"mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein,\" which is a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and differentiation.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are Wilms' tumor, kinase-insertion-type sarcoma, and steroidogenic factor 1."},
