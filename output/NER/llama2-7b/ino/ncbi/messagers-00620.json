However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that could be related to diseases:\n\n1. Mutants: The paragraph mentions mutants, which are genetic variations that can occur spontaneously or as a result of environmental factors. Some mutations can be associated with diseases.\n2. DNA binding ability: The paragraph highlights the enhanced DNA binding ability of these mutants. This could be related to diseases caused by mutations in genes that regulate DNA binding, such as cancer or genetic disorders.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph that could be related to diseases are:\n\n1. Mutants\n2. DNA binding ability"},
