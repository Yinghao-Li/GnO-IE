PWS (Prader-Willi Syndrome) - a genetic disorder caused by the loss of function of a gene on chromosome 15.\n2. Deletion - a genetic abnormality where a portion of a chromosome is missing.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The paragraph mentions \"Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis\" which is a technique used to detect genetic abnormalities, including deletions.\n* The analysis demonstrated that there was no deletion of the PWS region on the normal pair of 15s present in J, which suggests that the PWS critical region resides on a derivative chromosome 3.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in this paragraph are PWS and deletion."},
