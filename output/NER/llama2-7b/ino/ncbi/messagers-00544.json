RB1 gene: The paragraph mentions the RB1 gene specifically, indicating that it is a disease entity.\n2. Mutations: The paragraph mentions mutations in the RB1 gene, which are abnormal changes in the DNA sequence that can cause disease.\n3. Genetic counseling: The paragraph mentions genetic counseling in the context of families with distinctive phenotypes, which suggests that genetic counseling is a disease entity related to the RB1 gene.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
