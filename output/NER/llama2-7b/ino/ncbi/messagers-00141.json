To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"RB1 gene\": This is a gene that is associated with a particular disease or condition.\n2. \"mutation\": A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of a gene. In this context, the mutation is a nonsense mutation, which means that a stop codon (a codon that signals the end of a protein sequence) is present in the gene.\n3. \"homozygously\": This means that the mutation is present in both copies of the gene, one inherited from each parent.\n4. \"retinal tumors\": Tumors in the retina are a type of eye cancer.\n5. \"pineal tumors\": Tumors in the pineal gland are also a type of cancer.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* RB1 gene\n* retinal tumors\n* pineal tumors\n\nThese are the entities that are associated with the disease or condition described in the paragraph."},
