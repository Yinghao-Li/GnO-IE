It is a type of skin cancer that can be deadly if not detected and treated early.\n2. Familial melanoma: This is a type of melanoma that is inherited and occurs in multiple family members.\n3. Germline mutations: These are genetic mutations that are passed down from parents to offspring and can increase the risk of developing melanoma.\n4. Mutations: This is a more general term for any change in the DNA sequence of an organism. In this context, it refers to the specific genetic mutations that are being searched for in the families studied.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Melanoma\n2. Familial melanoma\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph (e.g. \"families\", \"criteria\") are not disease entities, but rather concepts related to the study design and criteria used to select the families for the study."},
