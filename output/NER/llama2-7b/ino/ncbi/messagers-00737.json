BRCA2\n\nExplanation:\n\n* BRCA1: The BRCA1 gene is associated with breast cancer and ovarian cancer. A mutation in the BRCA1 gene, such as the C4446T mutation mentioned in the paragraph, can increase the risk of developing these types of cancer.\n* BRCA2: The BRCA2 gene is also associated with breast cancer and ovarian cancer. A mutation in the BRCA2 gene, such as the 8765delAG mutation mentioned in the paragraph, can also increase the risk of developing these types of cancer."},
