HLA haplotypes: HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) is a group of genes that play a crucial role in the immune system. HLA haplotypes refer to the specific combinations of HLA genes that an individual inherits from their parents.\n2. Mutation: A mutation refers to a change in the DNA sequence of a gene. In this context, the paragraph mentions two specific mutations: C- > G and 845 G- > A.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are HLA haplotypes and mutations."},
