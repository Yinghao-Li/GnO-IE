Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) - This is the disease entity that the patients in the paragraph have. APC is a genetic condition that causes the development of numerous non-cancerous growths (adenomas) in the colon and rectum.\n2. Colorectal adenomas - These are the growths that occur in the colon and rectum as a result of APC. They are typically smaller than 100 in number.\n3. Florid phenotype - This is a term used to describe the more severe form of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which is characterized by the presence of many more than 100 adenomas in the colon and rectum.\n4. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) - This is the broader disease entity that includes both the attenuated and florid forms of the condition. FAP is a genetic condition that causes the development of numerous adenomas in the colon and rectum, which can eventually become cancerous if left untreated."},
