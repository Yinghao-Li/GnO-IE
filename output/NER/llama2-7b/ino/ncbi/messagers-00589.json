    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. Clinical report:\n * Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a genetic disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord.\n * It is characterized by progressive demyelination of the nervous system, leading to cognitive decline, loss of motor skills, and loss of vision.\n2. Biochemical report:\n * The family in the paragraph has a codon 291 deletion in the ABCD1 gene, which is responsible for producing the enzyme ALDH7A1.\n * This deletion leads to a deficiency of ALDH7A1, which is essential for the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids in the peroxisomes.\n3. Pathological report:\n * The deletion of the ABCD1 gene leads to the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in the peroxisomes, which can cause damage to the nervous system.\n * The accumulation of these fatty acids can lead to the formation of abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord, such as demyelination and loss of neurons.\n4. Genetic report:\n * The family in the paragraph has a codon 291 deletion in the ABCD1 gene, which is a genetic mutation that causes ALD.\n * This mutation is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)\n* Codon 291 deletion in the ABCD1 gene\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

    {"role": "user", "content": "Please present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\".\n\nMake sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},
