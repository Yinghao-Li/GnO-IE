However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that are related to disease:\n\n1. Patients: The paragraph mentions \"young and severely affected patients.\" These patients are likely to be suffering from a disease or disorder.\n2. Mutated allele: The paragraph mentions \"mutated allele\" which is a genetic variation that can cause disease.\n3. Restriction sites: The paragraph mentions \"restriction sites\" which are specific sequences of DNA that are recognized and cut by restriction enzymes. These sites can be associated with genetic diseases.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to disease in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Patients\n2. Mutated allele\n3. Restriction sites"},
