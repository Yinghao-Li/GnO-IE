    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Myotonic dystrophy: This is the disease entity being studied in the paragraph. It is a type of muscular dystrophy, a group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting.\n2. DM: This likely stands for \"myotonic dystrophy,\" which is the specific type of muscular dystrophy being studied in the paragraph.\n3. CTG repeat: This refers to a specific genetic repeat found in the DNA of individuals with myotonic dystrophy. The CTG repeat is a sequence of three nucleotides (cytosine, thymine, and guanine) that is repeated multiple times in the genome.\n4. Somatic instability: This refers to the instability of the CTG repeat in the genome of individuals with myotonic dystrophy. The repeat length can change over time, leading to genetic variation and potentially contributing to the progression of the disease."},
