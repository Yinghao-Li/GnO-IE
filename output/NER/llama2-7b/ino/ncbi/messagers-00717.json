Mutations: This is the main entity mentioned in the paragraph, and it refers to any change in the DNA sequence of an organism. Mutations can be classified as either deletions or point mutations, which are the specific types of mutations mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Deletions: This entity refers to the removal of a small portion of DNA sequence from a gene or genome. Deletions can result in the loss of function of the gene or genetic information, leading to various diseases.\n3. Point mutations: This entity refers to a specific type of mutation where a single nucleotide base in the DNA sequence is changed. Point mutations can also result in the loss of function of a gene or disrupt the normal functioning of a protein, leading to various diseases.\n\nTherefore, the entities identified as \"Disease\" in the paragraph are mutations, deletions, and point mutations."},
