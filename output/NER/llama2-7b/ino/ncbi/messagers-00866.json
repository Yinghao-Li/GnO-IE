Aniridia: This is the primary disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, referring to a condition characterized by the absence or partial absence of the iris in the eye.\n2. PAX6: This is a gene that is associated with aniridia, and the paragraph discusses the spectrum of mutations in this gene.\n3. Nonsense mutations: These are mutations that result in premature truncation of the PAX6 protein, leading to a non-functional protein.\n4. Splicing mutations: These are mutations that affect the splicing of the PAX6 mRNA, leading to a non-functional protein.\n5. Insertions: These are mutations that result in the insertion of extra nucleotides into the PAX6 gene, leading to a non-functional protein.\n6. Deletions: These are mutations that result in the deletion of nucleotides from the PAX6 gene, leading to a non-functional protein.\n7. Missense mutations: These are mutations that result in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the PAX6 protein, leading to a non-functional protein.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are aniridia, PAX6, and the various types of mutations that can occur in the PAX6 gene, including nonsense, splicing, insertions, deletions, and missense mutations."},
