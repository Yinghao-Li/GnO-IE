    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the following \"Disease\" entities can be identified:\n\n1. Exon skipping: This refers to a genetic mutation that results in the skipping of one or more exons in the DNA sequence of a gene. Exon skipping can lead to the production of a truncated or abnormal protein that can cause a variety of diseases.\n2. Premature protein truncation: This refers to a genetic mutation that results in the premature termination of protein synthesis, leading to the production of a truncated or abnormal protein. This can also cause a variety of diseases.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Exon skipping\n2. Premature protein truncation"},
