To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Disease\" entities in the first sentence:\n * \"Disease\" is a general term that refers to any abnormal condition that affects the body or mind.\n * \"Altered\" is a verb that means \"changed in a way that is not normal or expected.\"\n * \"Dp71\" is a specific disease entity, which is a type of protein that is involved in the development and progression of certain diseases.\n * \"Transcripts\" are genetic material that carries information from DNA to RNA, and are involved in the process of gene expression.\n2. \"Disease\" entities in the second sentence:\n * \"Deleted\" is a verb that means \"removed or taken away.\"\n * \"DNA\" is a specific disease entity, which is the genetic material that contains the instructions for the development and function of all living organisms.\n * \"Sequences\" are specific sequences of DNA that contain the instructions for the development and function of an organism.\n3. \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph as a whole:\n * \"Cerebral dysfunction\" is a specific disease entity that refers to any abnormality or disorder of the brain, particularly those that affect cognitive or motor function.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Dp71\n* DNA\n* Cerebral dysfunction"},
