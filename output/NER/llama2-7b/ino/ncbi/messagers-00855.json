MLD (Mucolipidosis type IV) - This is the main disease being discussed in the paragraph.\n2.

GS (Glutamine synthetase) - The paragraph also mentions that A464V mutation affects the GS gene, which is involved in the urea cycle.\n\nSo, the three \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
