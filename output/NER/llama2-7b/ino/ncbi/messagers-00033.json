To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"In 1 patient\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific individual who is the subject of the study.\n2. \"somatic mosaicism\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific genetic condition where there is a mixture of normal and abnormal cells in the body.\n3. \"molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the specific diagnostic test used to detect the presence of somatic mosaicism in the patient's blood.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Somatic mosaicism\n2. Molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood"},
