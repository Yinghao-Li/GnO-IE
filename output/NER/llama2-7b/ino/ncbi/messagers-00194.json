To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Protein\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific protein that is associated with a particular disease.\n2. \"truncation testing\" - This is a diagnostic test used to identify disease entities, specifically mutations in the ATM gene.\n3. \"ATM cDNA\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific gene that is associated with a particular disease.\n4. \"140 mutant alleles\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific number of mutations in the ATM gene.\n5. \"screened\" - This is a verb that indicates the process of identifying or detecting disease entities, specifically the mutations in the ATM gene.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Protein (truncation testing)\n* ATM gene (cDNA)\n* Mutations in the ATM gene (140 mutant alleles)"},
