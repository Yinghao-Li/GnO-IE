Glycine substitution: This is the specific genetic mutation that is being studied in the paragraph. It is a substitution of the amino acid glycine for another amino acid in the protein sequence.\n2. Homozygous individuals: This refers to individuals who have two copies of the same gene, in this case, the gene that encodes the protein with the glycine substitution. Homozygous individuals are at risk of developing certain genetic disorders because they have a double dose of the mutated gene.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Glycine substitution\n2. Homozygous individuals"},
