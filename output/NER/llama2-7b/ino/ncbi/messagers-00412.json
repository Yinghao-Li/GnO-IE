    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the following \"disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Premature termination: This refers to the abnormal termination of protein synthesis before the normal completion of the process, which can result in the production of truncated or incomplete proteins.\n2. C-terminal domain: This refers to the carboxy-terminal domain of a protein, which is the region located at the end of the protein sequence.\n3. NPII: This likely refers to a protein with an unknown name, but it could be a disease-related protein.\n4. Prohormone: This refers to a protein that is converted into a hormone in the body.\n5. Cysteine residue: This refers to a specific amino acid (cysteine) located in the protein sequence.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Premature termination\n* C-terminal domain\n* NPII\n* Prohormone\n* Cysteine residue"},

Disease: The paragraph mentions \"premature termination\" which can result in the production of truncated or incomplete proteins, which can lead to disease.\n2. Prohormone: The paragraph mentions \"prohormone\" which is converted into a hormone in the body, and the cysteine residue in position 85 could be involved in the correct folding of the prohormone, which is a disease-related protein.\n\nSo, the only disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
