Atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa (ABEB) - This is the primary disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, referring to a skin condition characterized by blistering and skin fragility.\n2. Generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa (GABEB) - This is a more specific term used to describe a subtype of ABEB, where the condition affects the entire body rather than being limited to specific areas.\n3. COL17A1 - This is the gene that is associated with ABEB/GABEB. A deletion mutation in this gene is identified as the underlying cause of the disease in the families described in the paragraph.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
