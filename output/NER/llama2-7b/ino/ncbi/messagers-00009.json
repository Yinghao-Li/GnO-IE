To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"B - cell non - Hodgkins lymphomas ( B - NHL )\" - This is a disease entity, a type of cancer that affects the immune system.\n2. \"B - NHL cell line\" - This is also a disease entity, a cell line that is derived from a patient with B - cell non - Hodgkins lymphoma.\n3. \"tumour DNA\" - This is a disease entity, referring to the genetic material of a tumor.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* B - cell non - Hodgkins lymphoma (B - NHL)\n* B - NHL cell line\n* tumour DNA"},
