    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the keywords:\n * \"Splicing\"\n * \"disrupted\"\n * \"DM\"\n * \"CUG repeats\"\n2. Look for context clues:\n * The paragraph mentions that splicing is disrupted in DM striated muscle, which suggests that the disease is related to muscle function.\n * The presence of CUG repeats in transcripts may indicate a genetic disorder.\n3. Check the dictionary definitions:\n * \"Disease\" can be defined as a condition that impairs the normal functioning of the body or mind, such as illness, sickness, or disorder.\n * \"Striated muscle\" refers to muscle tissue with a regular, parallel arrangement of muscle fibers, such as skeletal muscle.\n4. Identify the disease entities:\n * Based on the context and dictionary definitions, the disease entities in the paragraph are likely to be:\n  + DM (Disease of the muscle)\n  + Genetic disorder (related to the presence of CUG repeats in transcripts)\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* DM (Disease of the muscle)\n* Genetic disorder"},

    {"role": "user", "content": "Please present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\".\n\nMake sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here are the disease entities in the paragraph presented as a Markdown table:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| DM (Disease of the muscle) |\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}
