ATM (A-T) gene: This is a mutated gene, which means it has undergone a genetic change, leading to a disease.\n2. Human chromosome 11q22: This is the location on the human chromosome where the ATM gene is found. A mutation in this gene can lead to a disease.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. ATM (A-T) gene mutation\n2. Chromosome 11q22 mutation"},
