MPS IVA: This is the disease that the mutations in the GALNS gene are associated with. MPS IVA is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and leads to a range of cognitive, motor, and behavioral symptoms.\n2. Mutations: The paragraph mentions mutations in the GALNS gene, which are genetic changes that can cause disease.\n3.
