Jewish\n2. 185delAG\n3. mutation\n4. allelic pattern\n5. founder effect\n6. mutations\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Jewish: The paragraph specifically mentions \"Jewish\" as the population being studied, indicating that the mutations being discussed are associated with this ethnic group.\n2. 185delAG: This is a genetic mutation that is specific to the Jewish population and is associated with an increased risk of certain diseases.\n3. mutation: A genetic change in a DNA sequence that can occur spontaneously or as a result of environmental factors.\n4. allelic pattern: A specific pattern of genetic variation in a particular gene or genetic region.\n5. founder effect: A phenomenon in which a small group of individuals with a specific genetic mutation establishes a new population, which then becomes the dominant population in that area.\n6. mutations: Plural of mutation, referring to the genetic changes that occur in a population over time."},
