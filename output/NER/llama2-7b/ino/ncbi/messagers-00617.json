    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Aniridia: This is the disease that is associated with the mutations found in the C-terminal half of the PAX6 gene. Aniridia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the partial or complete absence of the iris (the colored part of the eye).\n2. Truncation mutations: These are mutations that result in the loss of some or all of the C-terminal half of the PAX6 gene.\n3. PAX6: This is the gene that is affected by the truncation mutations. PAX6 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the eye and other tissues.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
