PAX6-related disease: This refers to any disease or disorder that is caused by a mutation in the PAX6 gene.\n2. Missense mutations: These are mutations that result in a different amino acid being inserted into the PAX6 protein sequence. This can lead to a change in the protein's function and potentially cause disease."},
