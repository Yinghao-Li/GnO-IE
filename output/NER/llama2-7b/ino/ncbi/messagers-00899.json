Copper toxicosis: This is the disease that is being studied in the paragraph, and it is described as a locus (a specific location) on dog chromosome 10.\n2. Bedlington terriers: This is the breed of dog that is being studied for the copper toxicosis locus.\n3. Chromosome 10: This is the specific chromosome that the copper toxicosis locus is located on in dogs.\n4. Chromosome 2: This is the human chromosome that is syntenic (similar in location) to the copper toxicosis locus on dog chromosome 10.\n5. Copper toxicosis locus: This is the specific location on the dog chromosome where the copper toxicosis disease is located.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Copper toxicosis\n\nI hope this helps!
