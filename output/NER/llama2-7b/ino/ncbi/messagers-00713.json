Dutch ethnic origin\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. ATM mutation spectrum: This is a disease entity because it refers to a specific genetic mutation in the ATM gene that can lead to a range of health problems.\n2. A-T patients: This is a disease entity because it refers to individuals who have the A-T syndrome, which is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene.\n3. Immigrant populations: This is not a disease entity, but rather a population or demographic group.\n4. Dutch ethnic origin: This is not a disease entity, but rather an ethnic group.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* ATM mutation spectrum\n* A-T patients"},
