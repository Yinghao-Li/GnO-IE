Cerebellar hemispheres - abnormalities are detected in both left and right cerebellar hemispheres.\n2. Brain stem - abnormalities are detected in the brain stem.\n3. Cerebral white matter - there are reductions in cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in the cerebral white matter.\n\nSo, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cerebellar hemispheres abnormalities\n2. Brain stem abnormalities\n3. Cerebral white matter abnormalities"},
