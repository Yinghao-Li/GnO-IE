    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the following \"Disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Wilson disease: This is the disease that may be caused by gene rearrangements in the ATP7B gene, according to the paragraph. Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb copper, leading to copper accumulation in various organs and causing a range of symptoms including liver disease, neurological problems, and kidney damage.\n2. Gene rearrangements: The paragraph mentions that gene rearrangements in the ATP7B gene may cause Wilson disease. Gene rearrangements refer to changes in the structure or organization of genes, which can lead to mutations or other changes in the function of the gene.\n3. cDNA nucleotide 2302 (2302insC): The paragraph specifically mentions a mutation at this location in the ATP7B gene, which may be associated with Wilson disease. cDNA refers to the RNA copy of a gene that is produced through transcription of the DNA sequence. Nucleotide 2302 is a specific location in the ATP7B gene. The \"2302insC\" notation indicates that there is a insertion of a nucleotide (C) at position 2302 in the gene."},
