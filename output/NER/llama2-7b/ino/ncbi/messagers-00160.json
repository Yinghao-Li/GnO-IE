    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! In this paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. Smad4: The entity \"Smad4\" is mentioned as a \"mutant\" entity, which implies that it is associated with a disease or disorder.\n2. Tetraploid: The entity \"tetraploid\" is mentioned as a \"wild-type\" entity, which means it is the normal or typical form of a particular trait or condition. The term \"tetraploid\" refers to a cell or organism that has four sets of chromosomes, which is different from the typical diploid state with two sets of chromosomes.\n3. Gastrulation: The entity \"gastrulation\" is mentioned as a \"defect\" or \"disorder\", which implies that it is a disease or abnormality related to the development of the embryo.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Smad4 (mutant)\n* Tetraploid\n* Gastrulation (defect)"},

Here are the valid entities that refer to \"Disease\" in the paragraph, presented in a Markdown table with one column titled \"Disease\":\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Smad4 (mutant) |\n| Gastrulation (defect) |\n\nI hope this helps!
