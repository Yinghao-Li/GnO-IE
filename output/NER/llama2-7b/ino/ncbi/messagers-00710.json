    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the following \"Disease\" entities can be identified:\n\n1. Mutation: A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of a gene, which can lead to disease.\n2. Pre-mRNA splicing: Pre-mRNA splicing is the process by which non-coding regions of a pre-mRNA are removed and the remaining exons are joined together to form a mature mRNA molecule.\n3. 5 splice site: A 5 splice site is a specific location in the pre-mRNA where the splicing reaction occurs.\n4. Disease: The paragraph mentions that the mutation at the - 2 position of a 5 splice site has effects on pre-mRNA splicing, which can lead to disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Disease (mentioned in the last sentence)\n2. Pre-mRNA splicing (mentioned in the second sentence)\n3. 5 splice site (mentioned in the third sentence)\n4. Mutation (mentioned in the first sentence)"},
