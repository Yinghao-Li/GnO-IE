Here's the paragraph you provided:\n\n\"4 % and 10\"\n\nTo identify the disease entities in this paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"4\" - This is a numerical value, so it is not a disease entity.\n2. \"and\" - This is a conjunction, connecting the two numbers \"4\" and \"10\". It is not a disease entity.\n3. \"10\" - This is also a numerical value, so it is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities in the paragraph \"4 % and 10\"."},
