C6 gene mutations - This refers to mutations in the C6 gene, which is a gene that is associated with a specific disease or condition.\n2. Disease - The paragraph mentions that the proband (the person being tested) is a compound heterozygote for two C6 gene mutations, which suggests that they have a disease or condition that is caused by these mutations.\n\nI hope this helps!
