Gene: The gene segment being analyzed is identified as \"gene\" in the paragraph.\n2. Genomic: The term \"genomic\" is used to describe the overall genetic material of an organism, including all of its genes. In this context, \"genomic SacI - HindIII fragment\" refers to a specific segment of the genome that contains exons 11-15.\n3. Exons: Exons are the segments of DNA that contain the instructions for making proteins. In this paragraph, exons 11-15 are specifically mentioned as being part of the genomic segment being analyzed.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Gene\n2. Genomic\n3. Exons"},
