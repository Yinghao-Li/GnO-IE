    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) - This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP).\n2. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) - This is the hormone that is deficient in FNDI, and is encoded by the AVP-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene.\n3. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) - This is another name for arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is the hormone that regulates water balance in the body.\n4. Neurohypophyseal - This refers to the part of the brain where the AVP-NPII gene is located, which is the neurohypophysis.\n5. Chromosome 20p13 - This is the location of the AVP-NPII gene on chromosome 20.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
