    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the following \"Disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Heterodimer: This refers to a type of protein complex that consists of two different subunits. In this context, the added heterodimer is being compared to the TfR (transferrin receptor) and is reducing its affinity for transferrin.\n2. Transferrin: This is a protein that is responsible for transporting iron in the bloodstream. The reduced affinity of TfR for transferrin indicates that the added heterodimer is interfering with the normal function of TfR.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are:\n\n1. Heterodimer\n2. Transferrin deficiency or dysfunction (as reduced affinity of TfR for transferrin indicates a problem with transferrin transport)"},
