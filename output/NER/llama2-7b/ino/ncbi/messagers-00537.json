    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. Somatic mutation: A mutation that occurs in non-reproductive cells, which can lead to changes in the function or structure of the cell and potentially contribute to disease.\n2. Tissue: A group of cells that perform a specific function in the body, such as the brain, liver, or muscle. Diseases can affect specific tissues or organs.\n3. Transcriptional levels: The level of gene expression, which can be influenced by various factors, including genetic mutations, environmental factors, and developmental processes. Abnormalities in transcriptional levels can contribute to disease.\n4. Repeat: A sequence of DNA that is repeated multiple times in a genome. Some repeats can be associated with disease, such as trinucleotide repeats, which are involved in several neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nTherefore, the entities mentioned in the paragraph that can be classified as \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n1. Somatic mutation (mentioned as \"Disease\" in the paragraph)\n2. Transcriptional levels (mentioned as \"Disease\" in the paragraph)\n3. Repeat (mentioned as \"Disease\" in the paragraph, specifically referring to trinucleotide repeats)"},
