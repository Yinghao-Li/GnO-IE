To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"BRCA1\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a gene that is associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer.\n2. \"allelic patterns\" - This is a term used in genetics to describe the different forms of a gene, so it is not a disease entity itself.\n3. \"individuals\" - This is a general term that can refer to any person, so it is not a disease entity.\n4. \"185delAG\" - This is a specific mutation in the BRCA1 gene, which is a disease entity.\n5. \"breast / ovarian cancer\" - These are specific types of cancer, so they are disease entities.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* BRCA1\n* 185delAG mutation\n* breast cancer\n* ovarian cancer"},
