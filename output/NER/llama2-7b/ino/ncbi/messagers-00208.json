VHL gene: The Wild-type VHL gene is a gene that is present in a normal or healthy cell. The loss of this gene is associated with a specific cellular defect that may lead to tumor formation.\n2. Tumor: A tumor is a mass of abnormal cells that can grow and divide uncontrollably, potentially forming a cancer.\n3. Cancer: Cancer is a general term for a group of diseases that are characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. VHL gene disease (loss of wild-type VHL gene)\n2. Tumor (specific cellular defect leading to tumor formation)\n3. Cancer (general term for a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and spread)"},
