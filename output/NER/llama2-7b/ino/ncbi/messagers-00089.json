However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that are related to disease:\n\n1. Mutation: The paragraph mentions \"mutation\" specifically, which is a change in the DNA sequence of an organism. This can be a disease-causing mutation if it affects the function of a gene or protein.\n2. Restriction endonuclease: This is a type of enzyme that can cut DNA at specific recognition sites. In the context of the paragraph, the term \"restriction endonuclease analysis\" is used to confirm the presence of a mutation.\n\nTherefore, the two entities related to disease in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Mutation\n2. Restriction endonuclease"},
