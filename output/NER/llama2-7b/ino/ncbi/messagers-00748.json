Dystrophin gene: This is the gene that is being analyzed in the paragraph.\n2. DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy): This is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. It is a severe form of muscular dystrophy that affects males almost exclusively.\n3. Deletions: These are genetic mutations where a portion of the dystrophin gene is missing.\n4. Duplications: These are genetic mutations where an extra copy of a portion of the dystrophin gene is present.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy)\n2. Deletions\n3. Duplications"},
