Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) - This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a type of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) that has no identifiable cause.\n2. Cardiac causes - The paragraph mentions that in some cases, there may be no demonstrable (i.e., visible or measurable) cardiac causes to account for the episode of ventricular fibrillation, which suggests that the disease may be related to the heart.\n3. Non-cardiac causes - The paragraph also mentions that there may be no demonstrable non-cardiac causes to account for the episode, which suggests that the disease may be unrelated to the rest of the body.\n\nI hope this helps!
