HFE (Hemochromatosis gene mutation) - This is the disease entity that is being studied in the paragraph. It is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to regulate iron levels.\n2. Transferrin receptor (TfR) - This is the protein that HFE binds to, and its affinity for iron-loaded transferrin is reduced when HFE is present.\n3. Iron - loaded transferrin - This is the protein that carries iron in the bloodstream.\n\nSo, in summary, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is HFE, which affects the binding of transferrin receptor to iron-loaded transferrin, leading to changes in iron metabolism."},
