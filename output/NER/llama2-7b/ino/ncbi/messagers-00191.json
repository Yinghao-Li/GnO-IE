Ataxia - telangiectasia (AT): This is the disease entity being studied in the paragraph. It is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, and immunodeficiency.\n2. ATM gene: This is the gene that is associated with the disease entity AT. The paragraph mentions the detection of founder mutations in the ATM gene in ethnic populations.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ataxia - telangiectasia (AT)\n2. ATM gene"},
