Here are the entities that could be related to diseases:\n\n1. ATM: ATM is a gene that is associated with ataxia-telangiectasia, a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and causes progressive loss of coordination and balance.\n2. mouse: While the paragraph does not specifically mention mouse as a disease, mice are often used as a model organism in scientific research to study genetic diseases, including ataxia-telangiectasia.\n3. yeast: Yeast is a fungus that is commonly used in scientific research to study genetic diseases, including those that affect the nervous system.\n4. Drosophila: Drosophila is a type of fruit fly that is also commonly used as a model organism in scientific research to study genetic diseases, including those that affect the nervous system.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM)\n2. genetic diseases (implicitly mentioned as the focus of research using mouse, yeast, and Drosophila models)"},
