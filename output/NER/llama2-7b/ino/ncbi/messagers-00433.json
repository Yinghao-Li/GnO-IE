It is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb iron from food, leading to excessive iron accumulation in organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas.\n2. \"845 G - - > A\" and \"187 C - - > G\" are mutations. These are specific genetic variations that can cause hemochromatosis. The \"-\" symbols indicate the location of the mutation in the DNA sequence.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hemochromatosis\n2. 845 G - - > A mutation\n3. 187 C - - > G mutation"},
