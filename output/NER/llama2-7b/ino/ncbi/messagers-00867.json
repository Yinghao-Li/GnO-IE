    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Aniridia: This is the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a condition characterized by the partial or complete absence of the iris (the colored part of the eye).\n2. Pathological missense mutations: This is a type of genetic mutation that occurs when a point mutation changes a codon (a sequence of three nucleotides) in the DNA sequence of a gene, resulting in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. In the context of the paragraph, the author suggests that pathological missense mutations are common in aniridia patients, despite being rare.\n\nI hope this helps!
