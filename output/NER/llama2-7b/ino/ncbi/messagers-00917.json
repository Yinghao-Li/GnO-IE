To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Amino acid changes\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific alteration in the structure of proteins that can occur due to genetic mutations.\n2. \"patients\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to individuals who are suffering from a particular medical condition.\n3. \"non - FAP group of colorectal cancer patients\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific category of patients with colorectal cancer. \"FAP\" stands for \"familial adenomatous polyposis,\" which is a rare genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to develop many colorectal polyps and cancers. By contrast, the \"non-FAP group\" refers to patients who do not have this condition.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"Amino acid changes\"\n* \"patients\"\n* \"non-FAP group of colorectal cancer patients\""},
