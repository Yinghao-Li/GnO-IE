Predisposing mutation\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"Tumors\" refers to abnormal growths or masses of cells that can occur in any part of the body. In the context of the paragraph, it suggests that the missense mutation is associated with the development of tumors in some individuals.\n2. \"Predisposing mutation\" refers to a genetic mutation that increases the risk of developing a particular disease, in this case, tumors. The term \"predisposing\" means that the mutation does not directly cause the disease, but rather makes an individual more susceptible to it."},
