    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! In this paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) - This is the disease that the paragraph is discussing, a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and causes progressive loss of coordination and balance.\n2. Premutation - This refers to a genetic variation in which a small number of repeat units are expanded in a particular gene, in this case, the FRDA gene.\n3. Meiotic expansion - This refers to the expansion of repeat units in the gene during meiosis, the process by which gametes (sperm or egg cells) are formed.\n4. Mitotic expansion - This refers to the expansion of repeat units in the gene during mitosis, the process by which cells divide and replicate their DNA.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Friedreich ataxia and the premutation, as they are the focus of the paragraph and the genetic variations being discussed."},
