    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"constitutive methylation\" - This refers to the normal, constant methylation of a particular site or region. In this context, it means that there is always methylation at the specified site (intron 12) in normal individuals.\n2. \"intron 12\" - An intron is a region of non-coding DNA within a gene that is spliced out during mRNA processing. Intron 12 is the 12th intron in the gene.\n3. \"SacII\" and \"HhaI\" - These are restriction enzymes, which are enzymes that cut DNA at specific recognition sites. In this context, they are used to identify the location of methylation in the DNA.\n4. \"localized\" - This refers to the fact that the methylation is confined to a specific region of the DNA, rather than being widespread throughout the gene.\n5. \"1,159-1,232 bp upstream of the CTG repeat\" - This refers to the distance upstream of the CTG repeat (a specific sequence of nucleotides) where the methylation is observed. \"Upstream\" refers to the direction of transcription, so this means that the methylation is located upstream of the CTG repeat in the direction of transcription.\n6. \"normal individuals\" - This refers to healthy individuals who do not have the disease being studied.\n7. \"most of the patients\" - This refers to individuals who have the disease being studied.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Methylation (constitutive methylation)\n* Intron 12\n* SacII and HhaI (restriction enzymes)\n* CTG repeat (a specific sequence of nucleotides)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course! Here are the entities that clearly refer to \"disease\" in the paragraph:\n\n* Disease (mentioned twice)\n\nI removed the following entities that do not clearly refer to \"disease\":\n\n* Intron 12 (not a disease entity)\n* SacII and HhaI (not disease entities, they are restriction enzymes)\n* CTG repeat (not a disease entity, it's a specific sequence of nucleotides)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Please present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\".\n\nMake sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},
