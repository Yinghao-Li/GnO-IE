To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"RB1 gene mutation\": This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific genetic mutation that can lead to various diseases, including cancer.\n2. \"ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma\": This is another disease entity, as it refers to a specific type of cancer that affects the retina.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. RB1 gene mutation\n2. Ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma"},
