    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Autosomal dominant\" refers to the pattern of inheritance of the disease, which means that the mutation responsible for the disease is located on one of the autosomal chromosomes (chromosomes 1-22) and is inherited in an dominant manner.\n2. \"Neurohypophyseal\" refers to the location of the disease in the neurohypophysis, which is the part of the brain that produces antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin.\n3. \"Diabetes insipidus\" is the name of the disease that is being described. It is a rare disorder that affects the body's ability to regulate fluid levels, leading to excessive thirst and urination.\n4. \"Associated with\" refers to the fact that the missense mutation in neurophysin II is found in individuals with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.\n5. \"Missense mutation\" refers to a specific type of mutation in the DNA sequence of a gene that results in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by that gene. In this case, the mutation changes the amino acid glycine (Gly) at position 23 to valine (Val) in the neurophysin II protein.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus\n* Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus\n* Missense mutation in neurophysin II (specifically, Gly23 -> Val)"},

    {"role": "user", "content": "Please present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\".\n\nMake sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here are the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph, presented in a Markdown table:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus |\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}
