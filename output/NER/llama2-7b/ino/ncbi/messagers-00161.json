    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! In this paragraph, the following \"disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Smad4: This is a gene that is involved in the development of the embryo, and mutations in the Smad4 gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders.\n2. Gastrulation: This is a stage of embryonic development during which the blastula transforms into a gastrula, characterized by the formation of the three primary germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm). Gastrulation is a critical stage in the development of the embryo, and abnormalities in this process can lead to various developmental disorders and birth defects.\n3. Epiblast: This is one of the three primary germ layers that form during gastrulation. The epiblast gives rise to the ectoderm, which is the outermost layer of the embryo and is involved in the formation of the skin, nervous system, and other structures.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Smad4 (a gene involved in embryonic development and associated with various diseases)\n* Gastrulation (a stage of embryonic development that can lead to developmental disorders and birth defects if abnormal)\n* Epiblast (one of the three primary germ layers that form during gastrulation, which can lead to various developmental disorders if abnormal)."},
