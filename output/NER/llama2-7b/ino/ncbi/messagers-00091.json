Neurodegeneration: This refers to the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons in the brain, which can lead to various neurological disorders.\n2. Dominantly inherited neurodegeneration: This refers to a type of neurodegeneration that is caused by a mutation in a single copy of a gene, resulting in the majority of individuals inheriting the mutation and developing the disease.\n3. Magnocellular neuron: This refers to a type of neuron that is characterized by its large size and specific location in the brain.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
