Hereditary coproporphyria (HC) - This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which is an acute hepatic porphyria caused by deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO).\n2. Acute hepatic porphyria - This is a broader disease category that includes various types of porphyria, including hereditary coproporphyria.\n3. Autosomal dominant inheritance - This is a type of genetic inheritance, where the mutation that causes the disease is located on an autosome (one of the non-sex chromosomes).\n4. Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) - This is the enzyme that is deficient in hereditary coproporphyria, leading to the accumulation of toxic intermediates in the heme biosynthesis pathway and causing the symptoms of the disease.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
