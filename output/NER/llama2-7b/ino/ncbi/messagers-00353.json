To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Mucopolysaccharidosis\" is the disease name.\n2. \"IVA\" is an abbreviation for the disease, which stands for \"mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA.\"\n3. \"Australia\" and \"Northern Ireland\" are locations where the disease is found.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA)\n* T312S (a specific mutation of the MPS IVA gene)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
