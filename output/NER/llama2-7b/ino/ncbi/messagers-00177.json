Somatic mosaicism: This is the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, referring to the phenomenon of genetic variation in cells throughout the body.\n2. Genetic factors: The paragraph suggests that individual specific genetic factors may also play a role in somatic mosaicism, implying that genetic disorders or diseases may be involved.\n3. Environmental factors: The paragraph also suggests that environmental factors may contribute to somatic mosaicism, which could imply that exposure to certain environmental toxins or conditions may lead to disease.\n\nTherefore, the three disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Somatic mosaicism\n2. Genetic factors\n3. Environmental factors"},
