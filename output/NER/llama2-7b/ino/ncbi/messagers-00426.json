To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"UBE3A\" - This is a gene, which is a type of disease entity.\n2. \"encodes\" - This verb indicates that the UBE3A gene produces a protein, which is another type of disease entity.\n3. \"ubiquitin-protein ligase\" - This is a type of protein, which is a disease entity.\n4. \"brain-specific imprinting\" - This phrase indicates that the UBE3A gene is specifically expressed in the brain, which is a type of anatomical location, and therefore not a disease entity.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* UBE3A (gene)\n* ubiquitin-protein ligase (protein)"},
