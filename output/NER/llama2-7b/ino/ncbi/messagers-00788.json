However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the \"Disease\" entity being referred to is the genetic disorder caused by the 1936delG mutation.\n\nHere's how we can identify the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph:\n\n1. The paragraph mentions the 1936delG mutation, which is a specific genetic mutation that can cause a genetic disorder.\n2. The paragraph states that the 1936delG defect was observed only once in the Cape, which suggests that the disorder is rare and specific to a particular population or region.\n3. The paragraph goes on to mention that the associated haplotype (a set of genetic variations) of the 1936delG mutation could be deduced, which further supports the idea that the disorder is a specific genetic condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that the \"Disease\" entity being referred to is the genetic disorder caused by the 1936delG mutation."},
