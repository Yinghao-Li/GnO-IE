It is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and can cause muscle weakness, muscle wasting, and other symptoms.\n2. DMPK gene: This is the gene that is associated with myotonic dystrophy. The paragraph mentions that the DMPK gene of severely affected patients is hypermethylated proximal to the largely expanded CTG repeat.\n3. CTG repeat: This is a genetic repeat sequence that is found in the DMPK gene. It is expanded in myotonic dystrophy patients, and the length of the repeat is one of the factors that determines the severity of the disease."},
