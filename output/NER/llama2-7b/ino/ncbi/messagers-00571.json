To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"mutant mice\" - This is a living organism, not a disease entity.\n2. \"defects in hemostasis\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a problem with the body's ability to stop bleeding.\n3. \"highly prolonged bleeding time\" - This is a symptom of the disease entity \"defects in hemostasis\".\n4. \"spontaneous bleeding events\" - This is also a symptom of the disease entity \"defects in hemostasis\".\n5. \"approximately 10 % of neonates\" - This is a population characteristic, not a disease entity.\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"defects in hemostasis\"."},
