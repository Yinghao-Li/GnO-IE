To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"AS\" - This is an abbreviation for a disease entity, which is likely \"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\".\n2. \"twins\" - This is a disease entity, which is likely \"Twin\".\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\n* Twin (represented by the singular form \"twins\")\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
