Mutants: These are the entities being studied in the context of a disease. They are described as having mutations in the PAX6 gene.\n2. PAX6: This is a gene that is associated with a disease, as mentioned in the paragraph. It is the wild-type form of the gene that is being compared to the mutants.\n3. Transient transfection assays: This is a type of experiment or test used to study the behavior of the mutants. It is a way of measuring the effect of the mutations on the function of the PAX6 gene.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mutants\n2. PAX6\n\nThe other entities in the paragraph, such as \"wild-type PAX6\" and \"transient transfection assays,\" are not disease entities, but rather terms used to describe the context in which the mutants are being studied."},
