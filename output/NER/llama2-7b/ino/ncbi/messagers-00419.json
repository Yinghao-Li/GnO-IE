Saethre-Chotzen syndrome\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. TWIST mutations: The paragraph mentions that the detection rate for TWIST mutations is 68% in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome patients, including five patients with TWIST mutations reported elsewhere. Therefore, TWIST mutations are a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. FGFR mutations: The paragraph does not provide any specific information about FGFR mutations, but it does mention that the detection rate for TWIST mutations is 68% in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome patients, including five patients with TWIST mutations reported elsewhere. Therefore, FGFR mutations can be inferred as a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n3. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, as it is the context in which the detection rate for TWIST and FGFR mutations is being discussed. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities and other symptoms."},
