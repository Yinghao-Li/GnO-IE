ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone)\n2. alpha-MSH (Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone)\n\nBoth of these hormones are involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including the production of steroid hormones and the immune response. The mutations mentioned in the paragraph (G7013T and C7133delta) are likely to affect the synthesis or function of these hormones, leading to a disease state."},
