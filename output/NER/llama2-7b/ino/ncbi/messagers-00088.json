    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"affected girl\" - This refers to a person who is suffering from a disease or disorder. In this case, the girl is affected by a novel mutation.\n2. \"similarly affected younger brother\" - This refers to another person who is also suffering from the same disease or disorder as the affected girl. In this case, the brother is also affected by the novel mutation.\n3. \"father\" - This refers to the person who is the biological father of the affected girl and her brother.\n4. \"novel missense mutation (G1758 - > T) encoding the amino acid substitution Gly23 - > Val within NPII\" - This refers to a specific genetic mutation that has occurred in the DNA of the affected individuals. The mutation is located in the NPII gene and results in a substitution of the amino acid Gly23 with Val.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"affected girl\"\n* \"similarly affected younger brother\"\n* \"father\"\n* \"novel missense mutation (G1758 - > T) encoding the amino acid substitution Gly23 - > Val within NPII\""},

Here are the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n* \"novel missense mutation (G1758 - > T) encoding the amino acid substitution Gly23 - > Val within NPII\"\n\nThis refers to a specific genetic mutation that has occurred in the DNA of the affected individuals, which is associated with a disease or disorder."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Please present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\".\n\nMake sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here are the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| novel missense mutation (G1758 - > T) encoding the amino acid substitution Gly23 - > Val within NPII |\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}
