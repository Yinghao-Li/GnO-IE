To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Deficiency\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a lack or abnormality in a particular component of the body.\n2. \"sixth component of human complement\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific part of the body that is involved in the disease.\n3. \"C6\" - This is a disease entity, as it is a specific component of the human complement system that is being referred to.\n4. \"families from the western Cape, South Africa\" - These are patient populations, which are disease entities because they are groups of people who are affected by the disease.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Deficiency\n* sixth component of human complement (C6)\n* families from the western Cape, South Africa (patient populations)"},
