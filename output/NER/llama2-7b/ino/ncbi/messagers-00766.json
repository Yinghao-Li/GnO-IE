C-T mutation: This is a genetic mutation that occurs when a C nucleotide is replaced by a T nucleotide in the DNA sequence.\n2. TIC-1: This is a putative alternative translation initiation codon, which is a sequence of nucleotides that is proposed to be recognized by the ribosome as a signal to initiate protein synthesis.\n3. TIC-2: This is another putative alternative translation initiation codon that is different from TIC-1.\n\nSo, in summary, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. C-T mutation (a genetic mutation)\n2. TIC-1 (a putative alternative translation initiation codon)\n3. TIC-2 ( another putative alternative translation initiation codon)"},
