Influx: The excessive or abnormal entry of a substance into a cell or organism, which can lead to various diseases.\n2. Extracellular: Referring to substances or structures outside of a cell. In this context, it implies that the Ca2+ ions are entering the cell through a channel from outside the cell, which can be a sign of a disease.\n3. L-type Ca2+ channel: A specific type of ion channel that is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ entry into cells. Dysfunction or abnormalities in these channels can lead to various diseases, such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle cramps.\n\nTherefore, the entities identified as \"Disease\" in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
