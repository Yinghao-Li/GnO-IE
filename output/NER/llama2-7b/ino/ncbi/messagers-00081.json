However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that are related to diseases:\n\n1. Saamis: According to the paragraph, Saamis have a lower frequency of the Tyr allele compared to other populations. This suggests that Saamis may be at a higher risk of developing certain diseases that are associated with that allele.\n2. Mordvinians: Similarly, Mordvinians have a lower frequency of the Tyr allele compared to other populations, which may indicate a higher risk of disease for this group as well.\n\nSo, while the term \"Disease\" does not appear directly in the paragraph, we can infer that the entities mentioned are related to diseases based on the context."},
