Mutations refer to changes in the DNA sequence of a gene that can lead to genetic disorders or diseases. In this case, the mutations are in the gene encoding type XVII collagen (COL17A1).\n3. Gene encoding type XVII collagen (COL17A1) is a disease entity because it is a gene that is associated with skin fragility due to mutations."},
