It is referred to as \"WD gene ATP7B\".\n2. CT: This stands for \"Cerebral Tumor\", which is the disease being studied in the paragraph.\n3. ATP7B: This is the gene product of the WD gene, which is being studied in the paragraph.\n4. C04107: This is a gene that is being studied in conjunction with ATP7B. It is referred to as \"C04107\" in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. CT (Cerebral Tumor)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
