Pendred syndrome: This is the disease that the patients in the paragraph are affected with. It is a rare genetic disorder that affects the inner ear and can lead to hearing loss.\n2. L236P: This is a genetic mutation that is associated with Pendred syndrome. It is a point mutation that affects the L236 residue in the TMEM27 gene, which is responsible for producing a protein involved in the development and function of the inner ear.\n3. T416P: This is another genetic mutation that is associated with Pendred syndrome. It is also a point mutation, affecting the T416 residue in the TMEM27 gene.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Pendred syndrome\n2.
