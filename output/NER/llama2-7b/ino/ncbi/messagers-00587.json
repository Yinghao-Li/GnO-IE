To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Oral\" is not a disease entity, it's a term used to describe a type of contraceptive use.\n2. \"Ovarian cancer\" is a disease entity.\n3. \"BRCA1 mutation\" and \"BRCA2 mutation\" are disease entities. These are genetic mutations that increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Ovarian cancer\n* BRCA1 mutation\n* BRCA2 mutation"},
