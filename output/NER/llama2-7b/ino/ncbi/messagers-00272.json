Disease: None of the entities mentioned in the paragraph are related to a specific disease.\n2. HFE: Hepatocyte growth factor (HFE) is a protein that plays a role in cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and survival.\n3. beta2m: Beta-2-microglobulin (beta2m) is a protein that is involved in the transport of proteins in the bloodstream.\n4. TfR: Transferrin receptor (TfR) is a protein that is responsible for the uptake of transferrin, a protein that is involved in the transport of iron in the bloodstream.\n5. HeLa: HeLa cells are a type of immortalized cell line that is commonly used in scientific research.\n\nSo, the only disease-related entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"HeLa cell TfR,\" which refers to the transferrin receptor found on the surface of HeLa cells."},

Disease: Hepatocyte growth factor (HFE) is involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and survival, and is also implicated in certain diseases, including cancer and liver disease.\n2. Disease: Beta-2-microglobulin (beta2m) is a protein that is involved in the transport of proteins in the bloodstream, and is also associated with certain diseases, including kidney disease and cancer.\n\nI hope this helps!
