It is a genetic disorder that affects the muscles and can cause muscle weakness, muscle wasting, and other symptoms.\n2. Somatic CTG repeat length heterogeneity: This refers to the variation in the length of a specific DNA sequence (the CTG repeat) in the blood cells of myotonic dystrophy patients. This variation is thought to be a result of the disease process.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myotonic dystrophy\n2. Somatic CTG repeat length heterogeneity"},
