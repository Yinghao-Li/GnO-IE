Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA: This is the disease that the novel mutation (G301C) is associated with. It is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce a specific enzyme called N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase.\n2. Mucopolysaccharidosis: This is a broader term that refers to a group of genetic disorders that are characterized by the accumulation of sugar molecules in the body. Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA is a specific type of mucopolysaccharidosis.\n3. N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase: This is the enzyme that is deficient or defective in individuals with mucopolysaccharidosis IVA. The enzyme plays a crucial role in the breakdown and recycling of sugar molecules in the body.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
