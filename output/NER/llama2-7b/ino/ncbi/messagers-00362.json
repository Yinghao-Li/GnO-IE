I113F mutation: This is a genetic mutation that is mentioned in the paragraph as being present in Australia and Northern Ireland. It is likely that this mutation is associated with a specific disease or condition.\n2. T312S mutation: Similarly, this mutation is mentioned as being present in Australia and Northern Ireland, and is likely associated with a specific disease or condition.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. I113F disease\n2. T312S disease"},
