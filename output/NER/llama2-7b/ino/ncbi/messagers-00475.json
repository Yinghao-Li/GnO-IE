However, based on the context, we can infer that the \"Disease\" entities being referred to are the genetic mutations that were identified in the study.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how we can identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. \"Six different mutations\" - This phrase suggests that there are six distinct genetic changes or mutations that were identified in the study.\n2. \"on 12 of the 16 alleles examined\" - This phrase indicates that the mutations were identified on 12 of the 16 possible alleles (forms) of a particular gene.\n\nTherefore, based on the context, we can infer that the \"Disease\" entities being referred to are the genetic mutations that were identified in the study, which are likely to be associated with a particular disease or condition."},
