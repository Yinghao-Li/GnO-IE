To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Disease\" - This is the main term we are trying to identify.\n2. \"neurological dysfunction\" - This is a symptom or sign of the disease.\n3. \"attacks\" - This is a term that suggests a recurring or periodic nature of the disease.\n4. \"drugs\" - This is a potential trigger or cause of the disease.\n5. \"fasting\" - This is another potential trigger or cause of the disease.\n6. \"cyclical hormonal changes\" - This is another potential trigger or cause of the disease.\n7. \"infectious diseases\" - This is another potential cause of the disease.\n\nBased on these clues, we can identify the disease entity as \"epilepsy\". Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurring seizures, which can be triggered by various factors such as drugs, fasting, cyclical hormonal changes, or infectious diseases."},
