However, based on the context, we can identify the following entities that could be related to diseases:\n\n1. Mutations: The paragraph mentions \"seventeen mutations\" that are \"distinct.\" Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of an organism, and they can sometimes lead to diseases.\n2. Previously unreported mutations: The paragraph specifically highlights that 10 of the mutations were not reported previously. This suggests that these mutations are new and may be associated with diseases that have not been previously identified or studied.\n\nTherefore, while the term \"Disease\" is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, we can infer that the mutations described are potentially related to diseases."},

Disease: The term \"Disease\" is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but it is implied through the context.
