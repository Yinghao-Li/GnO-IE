To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"novel missense mutation\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific genetic mutation that has not been previously identified.\n2. \"patients from a retinoblastoma pedigree\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a group of individuals who are related and have a specific genetic disorder (retinoblastoma).\n3. \"showing only mild expression of the tumor phenotype\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the specific manifestation of the disease in these patients, which is characterized by a mild expression of the tumor phenotype.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Novel missense mutation\n2. Retinoblastoma\n3. Tumor phenotype"},
