Mutations in BARD1 have been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer.\n3. S phase: S phase is a stage of the cell cycle during which DNA replication occurs.\n4. G1 phase: G1 phase is a stage of the cell cycle during which the cell grows and prepares to enter the S phase.\n\nSo, the paragraph is discussing the distribution of the BARD1 protein within the cell during different stages of the cell cycle, and how it relates to the BRCA1 gene."},
