Obesity: The paragraph mentions \"severe early-onset obesity,\" which refers to a condition where a person experiences excessive weight gain at an early age.\n2. Adrenal insufficiency: The paragraph states that some people with POMC mutations may experience \"adrenal insufficiency,\" which means that the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, such as cortisol, that are essential for the body's response to stress.\n3. Red hair pigmentation: The paragraph notes that POMC mutations can also cause \"red hair pigmentation,\" which refers to the production of a different type of pigment in the hair follicles, resulting in red or orange hair color.\n\nSo, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Obesity\n2. Adrenal insufficiency\n3. Red hair pigmentation"},
