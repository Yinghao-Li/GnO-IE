    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Truncation mutations\" - This is a type of genetic mutation that occurs when a portion of a gene is missing or deleted. In this case, the mutation is in the \"transactivation region\" of the PAX6 gene.\n2. \"PAX6\" - This is a gene that plays a crucial role in the development of many tissues, including the eyes, face, and nervous system. Mutations in the PAX6 gene can lead to a variety of developmental disorders, including eye and facial abnormalities.\n3. \"Dominant-negative mutants\" - This term refers to a type of mutation where a mutated gene produces a protein that interferes with the normal function of the wild-type gene. In this case, the mutation in the PAX6 gene results in a dominant-negative effect, meaning that the mutated protein inhibits the normal function of the wild-type PAX6 protein.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Truncation mutations\n* PAX6 gene mutations\n* Dominant-negative mutations\n\nThese entities are related to the developmental disorders that can occur as a result of mutations in the PAX6 gene."},

Here are the valid entities in the paragraph, presented in a Markdown table with one column titled \"Disease\":\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Truncation mutations in the transactivation region of PAX6 result in dominant-negative mutants. |\n\nI hope this helps!
