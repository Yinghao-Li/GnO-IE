Mutations: This refers to changes in the DNA sequence of a gene, which can be associated with genetic diseases.\n3. Non - Caucasian populations: This refers to groups of people who are not of Caucasian (European) ancestry, and may be at higher risk for certain diseases due to genetic differences.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are HLA typing, mutations, and non-Caucasian populations."},
