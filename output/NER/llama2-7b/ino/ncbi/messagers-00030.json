Cancer: The paragraph mentions \"tumors\" which are abnormal growths of cells that can be cancerous.\n2. Hypermutation: The paragraph mentions \"mutations\" which are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell. Hypermutation refers to an abnormal increase in the number of mutations in a cell or organism.\n3. Methylation: The paragraph mentions \"hypermethylation\" which is an abnormal increase in the number of methyl groups attached to the DNA molecule. Methylation is a process that can affect gene expression and is often associated with cancer.\n\nSo, the three \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are cancer, hypermutation, and methylation."},
