Myotonic dystrophy: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph, which refers to a type of muscular dystrophy caused by disruptions in splicing regulation.\n2. CUG-binding protein: This is a protein that is involved in regulating splicing, and the disruption of which leads to myotonic dystrophy.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myotonic dystrophy\n2. CUG-binding protein disruption"},
