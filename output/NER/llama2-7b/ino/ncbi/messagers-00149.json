DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography: This is another laboratory technique used to separate and analyze proteins based on their charge and size. It is not a disease entity.\n4. Radial immunodiffusion: This is a laboratory technique used to measure the binding of antibodies to antigens. It is not a disease entity.\n5.
