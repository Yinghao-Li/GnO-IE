Angelman syndrome: This is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the UBE3A gene, which can result in developmental delays, intellectual disability, and other characteristic symptoms.\n2. 15q11-q13 deletions: This refers to a genetic abnormality where a portion of chromosome 15 is missing, which can lead to Angelman syndrome.\n3. Chromosome 15 paternal uniparental disomy: This is a genetic condition where a person has two copies of chromosome 15, one from each parent, which can also lead to Angelman syndrome.\n\nSo, the three \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are Angelman syndrome, 15q11-q13 deletions, and chromosome 15 paternal uniparental disomy."},
