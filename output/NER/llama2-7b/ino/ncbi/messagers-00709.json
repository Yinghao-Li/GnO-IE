    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the following \"disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. CYP27 gene: This is the gene that is associated with a deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity.\n2. Sterol 27-hydroxylase activity: This is the enzymatic activity that is deficient due to the C to A mutation in the CYP27 gene.\n3. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing: This is a phenomenon that occurs in the gene due to the mutation, where the pre-mRNA is spliced differently than usual.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. CYP27 gene deficiency\n2. Sterol 27-hydroxylase activity deficiency\n3. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing."},
