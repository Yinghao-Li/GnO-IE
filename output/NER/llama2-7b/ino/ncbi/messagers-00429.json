    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. \"frameshifts\" - a type of mutation that can cause genetic diseases by disrupting the normal reading frame of the genetic code.\n2. \"stop codon\" - a codon that signals the termination of protein synthesis, and a mutation in which a stop codon is added or changed can cause a premature termination of protein synthesis, leading to a non-functional protein.\n3. \"missense mutation\" - a type of mutation in which a single nucleotide change results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein, potentially leading to a non-functional protein.\n4. \"insertion of an isoleucine in the hect domain of the UBE3A protein\" - a specific mutation that can cause a change in the structure or function of the UBE3A protein, which is involved in ubiquitin transfer and E2 binding.\n\nSo, the four disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. frameshifts\n2. stop codon\n3. missense mutation\n4. UBE3A protein mutation (specifically, insertion of an isoleucine in the hect domain)"},
