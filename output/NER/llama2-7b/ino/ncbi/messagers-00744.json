Mutation: A genetic change in the DNA sequence of a gene or genes, which can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful. In this context, the mutation is likely to be harmful, as it is associated with a shared haplotype among carriers from different families.\n2. Haplotype: A set of genetic variants, including a mutation, that are inherited together on the same chromosome. In this paragraph, the haplotype is shared among carriers from different families, indicating that the mutation is likely to be identical by descent in the founder population.\n3. Founder population: The original group of individuals from which a population or species evolved. In this context, the founder population is the group of individuals from which the mutation is thought to have originated.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mutation\n2. Haplotype\n3. Founder population"},
