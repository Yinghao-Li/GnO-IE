To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"mutation\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a change in the DNA or genetic material of an organism that can lead to disease.\n2. \"HFE\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific gene that is associated with a disease called hemochromatosis.\n3. \"beta2-microglobulin\" (beta2m) - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific protein that is associated with a disease called hemophilia A.\n4. \"cell-surface expression\" - This is not a disease entity, as it refers to a biological process rather than a specific disease.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"mutation\"\n* \"HFE\"\n* \"beta2-microglobulin\" (beta2m)"},
