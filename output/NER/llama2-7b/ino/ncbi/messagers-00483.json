Type 1\n\nHere's how we can identify them:\n\n1. Tay-Sachs disease (TSD): This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is identified by the phrase \"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), the fatal infantile form of G (M2) gangliosidosis, Type 1.\"\n2. G (M2) gangliosidosis: This is a broader category of diseases that includes Tay-Sachs disease. The letter \"G\" refers to the type of gangliosidosis, and the number \"M2\" refers to the specific subtype.\n3. Type 1: This refers to the specific type of Tay-Sachs disease caused by mutations in the HEXA gene.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Tay-Sachs disease (TSD)\n* G (M2) gangliosidosis\n* Type 1"},
