To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"C9\" - This refers to a specific gene or protein, which is likely the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph.\n2. \"deficient individuals\" - This phrase suggests that there are individuals who are missing or lacking something, which could be the \"Disease\" entity.\n3. \"nonsense substitution\" - This phrase suggests that there is a mutation or change in the DNA sequence that results in a premature stop codon, which could be the \"Disease\" entity.\n4. \"codon 95 in exon 4\" - This specific location in the DNA sequence suggests that the mutation or change is occurring in a specific gene or protein, which could be the \"Disease\" entity.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the \"Disease\" entity is likely \"C9 deficiency,\" which refers to a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the C9 gene."},
