Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) - a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, which leads to the accumulation of a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in the brain and other tissues, resulting in progressive nerve damage and death in children.\n2. Deficiency of hexosaminidase A - a condition in which the activity of the hexosaminidase A enzyme is significantly reduced, leading to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the brain and other tissues, which can cause similar symptoms to Tay-Sachs disease."},
