ATP7B gene mutations: The paragraph mentions mutations in the ATP7B genes, which can lead to various diseases, including:\n2. Hemochromatosis: Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which leads to the accumulation of iron in the body's organs, particularly the liver, heart, and pancreas.\n3. Hereditary hemochromatosis: This is a specific type of hemochromatosis that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated ATP7B gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are hemochromatosis and hereditary hemochromatosis."},
