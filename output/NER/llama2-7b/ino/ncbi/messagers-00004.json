    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the keywords:\n * \"leukaemia\"\n * \"ATM\"\n * \"mutation\"\n * \"missense mutations\"\n2. Identify the entities:\n * \"leukaemia\" is a disease entity.\n * \"ATM\" is a gene entity.\n * \"mutation\" is a process entity.\n * \"missense mutations\" is a type of mutation entity.\n3. Classify the entities:\n * \"leukaemia\" is a disease entity, which is a type of medical condition.\n * \"ATM\" is a gene entity, which is a part of the genetic material.\n * \"mutation\" is a process entity, which is a change in the genetic material.\n * \"missense mutations\" is a type of mutation entity, which is a specific type of genetic change.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"leukaemia\"\n\nThe \"Gene\" entities are:\n\n* \"ATM\"\n\nThe \"Process\" entities are:\n\n* \"mutation\"\n\nThe \"Type of Mutation\" entities are:\n\n* \"missense mutations\""},

    {"role": "user", "content": "Please present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\".\n\nMake sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here are the valid \"Disease\" entities from the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| leukaemia |\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}
