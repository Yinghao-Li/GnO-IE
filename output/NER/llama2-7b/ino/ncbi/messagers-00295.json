Disease: The paragraph explicitly states that none of the mutations were observed in the PTPase core motif, which implies that the mutations may be associated with a specific disease or disorder.\n\nTherefore, the two entities that can be identified as \"Disease\" in the given paragraph are \"Mutations\" and \"Disease\"."},
