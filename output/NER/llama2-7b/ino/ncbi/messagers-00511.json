ACTH deficiency: This is a condition where the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) produced by the pituitary gland is deficient or absent.\n2. POMC defect: POMC stands for pro-opiomelanocortin, which is a protein that plays a crucial role in the production of hormones such as ACTH and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). A defect in the POMC gene can lead to a deficiency of these hormones.\n\nSo, the two diseases mentioned in the paragraph are ACTH deficiency and POMC defect."},
