    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the following \"Disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Mutation: The term \"mutation\" refers to any change in the DNA sequence of an organism. In this context, the paragraph is suggesting that most mutations result in a loss of function of the mutant allele.\n2. Nonsense codons: Nonsense codons are codons that signal the termination of protein synthesis. When a nonsense codon is encountered during protein synthesis, the process is terminated, and a truncated protein is produced. More than 80% of exonic substitutions result in nonsense codons, according to the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mutation\n2. Nonsense codons"},

Disease: The term \"disease\" is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but the context suggests that the focus is on diseases caused by mutations in the DNA sequence.\n2. Nonsense codons: These are codons that signal the termination of protein synthesis, leading to the production of truncated or non-functional proteins, which can result in disease."},
