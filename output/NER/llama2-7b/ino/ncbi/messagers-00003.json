T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) - This is the disease that the researchers are studying.\n2. ATM - This is a gene that is mutated in T-PLL, according to the paragraph.\n3. A-T - This is a reference to \"Ataxia-Telangiectasia,\" which is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, and immunodeficiency.\n\nSo, in summary, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
