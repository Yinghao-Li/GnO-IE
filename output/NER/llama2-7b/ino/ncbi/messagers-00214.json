Cycloheximide: This is a drug or chemical compound that facilitates the identification of aberrant transcripts.\n2. COL17A1: This is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the structure and function of skin.\n3. Generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa (GBEB): This is a type of skin disorder characterized by blistering and skin fragility.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cycloheximide\n2. COL17A1\n3. Generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa (GBEB)"},
