Identify the entities in the sentence:\n * Acceptor splice - site mutation\n * Aberrant transcripts\n * Disease\n2. Determine the type of entity each word represents:\n * Acceptor splice - site mutation: Biological process\n * Aberrant transcripts: Biological process\n * Disease: Medical condition\n3. Identify the relationships between the entities:\n * Acceptor splice - site mutation is a cause of aberrant transcripts\n * Aberrant transcripts are a result of the acceptor splice - site mutation\n * Disease is a consequence of the aberrant transcripts\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Disease (consequence of aberrant transcripts)"},
