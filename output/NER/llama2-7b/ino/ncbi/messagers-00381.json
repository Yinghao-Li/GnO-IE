Heteroduplex: This is a disease or abnormality in the DNA molecule, which can be detected through the analysis of abnormally migrating bands in agarose gel electrophoresis.\n2. Direct DNA sequencing: This is a diagnostic test that involves determining the order of the nucleotide bases (A, C, G, and T) that make up an organism's DNA. It can be used to identify genetic disorders or diseases caused by mutations in specific genes.\n\nSo, in summary, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Heteroduplex\n2. Genetic disorder or disease caused by mutations in specific genes (implicitly mentioned as the cause of the abnormally migrating bands in the agarose gel electrophoresis)"},
