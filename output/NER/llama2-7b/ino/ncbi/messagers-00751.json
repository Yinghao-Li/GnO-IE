    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! In this paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. Cognitive impairment: This is a general term that refers to a decline in cognitive function, including memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities.\n2. Deletions: These are genetic mutations where a portion of the gene is missing.\n3. Duplications: These are genetic mutations where there is an extra copy of a portion of the gene.\n4. Gene: This is the specific DNA sequence that carries the information for a particular protein or function in the body. In this case, the gene being referred to is the one that is localized in the distal part of the gene.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are cognitive impairment, deletions, and duplications."},

Cognitive impairment: This is a general term that refers to a decline in cognitive function, including memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities.\n2.
