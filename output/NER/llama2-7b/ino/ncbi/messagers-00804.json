Myotonic dystrophy\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Segregation distortion: This is a term used to describe a type of genetic disorder that affects the way genetic material is inherited. In myotonic dystrophy, the mutations in the DNA can cause problems with the segregation of genetic material during cell division, leading to a distortion in the expression of genes.\n2. Myotonic dystrophy: This is a type of muscular dystrophy, a group of genetic disorders that affect the muscles and can cause muscle weakness, muscle wasting, and muscle degeneration. Myotonic dystrophy is caused by mutations in the DNA that affect the function of the muscle proteins, leading to muscle weakness and wasting.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
