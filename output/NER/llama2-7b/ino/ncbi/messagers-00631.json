Disease (mentioned as \"disease\" in the paragraph)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL): LDL is a type of cholesterol-carrying protein found in the blood. High levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood can lead to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition in which plaque builds up inside the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n2. Disease: The paragraph mentions \"disease\" in the context of the cloning of a novel member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. This implies that the novel receptor may be involved in the development or progression of some disease related to LDL cholesterol or atherosclerosis.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
