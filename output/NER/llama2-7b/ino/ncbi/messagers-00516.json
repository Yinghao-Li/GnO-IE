Homozygous: This refers to a genetic condition where an individual has two copies of a mutated gene, one from each parent. In this case, the mutation is in the POMC gene.\n2. Mutation: A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of a gene. In this case, the mutation is in exon 2 of the POMC gene and results in the abolition of POMC translation.\n3. POMC: POMC stands for pro-opiomelanocortin. It is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, immune function, and pigmentation.\n4. Translation: Translation is the process by which the information encoded in a gene's DNA is used to synthesize a protein. In this case, the mutation in the POMC gene abolishes POMC translation.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Homozygous\n2. Mutation\n3. POMC\n4. Translation"},
