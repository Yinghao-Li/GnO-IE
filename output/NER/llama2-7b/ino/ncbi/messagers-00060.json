Genetic effects: The term \"genetic effects\" is used to describe the influence of genetic factors on the development or expression of a trait or disease. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity.\n2. Population variance: The term \"population variance\" refers to the variation in a trait or characteristic among a group of individuals in a population. In this context, it can be considered a disease entity because it is being used to describe the variation in a trait that is being studied.\n\nSo, the two disease entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
