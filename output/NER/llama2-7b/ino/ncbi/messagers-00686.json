VHL protein: This is a disease-related entity, as it is a tumor suppressor protein that is mutated in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of benign and malignant tumors.\n2. CA12: This is a disease-related entity, as it is a protein that is overexpressed in various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer.\n3. CA9: This is also a disease-related entity, as it is overexpressed in various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer.\n\nTherefore, the entities \"VHL protein\", \"CA12\", and \"CA9\" are disease-related entities in the given paragraph."},
