Breast cancer: The paragraph mentions that the reagents detect a 220 kD protein localized in discrete nuclear foci in all epithelial cell lines, including those derived from breast malignancies. This implies that the protein is present in breast cancer cells.\n2. Epithelial cell lines: The paragraph mentions that the reagents detect a 220 kD protein localized in discrete nuclear foci in all epithelial cell lines. This implies that the protein is present in epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the outer and inner surfaces of organs and glands in the body.\n\nI hope this helps!
