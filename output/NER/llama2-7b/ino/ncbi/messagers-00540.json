Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. \"tumors\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to abnormal growths of tissue that can be benign or malignant.\n2. \"unilateral tumors\" - This is a specific type of disease entity, as it refers to tumors that occur on one side of the body.\n3. \"mutation carriers\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to individuals who carry a genetic mutation that can cause a disease.\n4. \"unaffected\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to individuals who do not exhibit symptoms of a disease, but may be carriers of the mutation.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Tumors\n* Unilateral tumors\n* Mutation carriers\n* Unaffected individuals"},
