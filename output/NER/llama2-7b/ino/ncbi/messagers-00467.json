    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Mice\" - These are the organisms being studied in the paragraph.\n2. \"harbouring\" - This verb indicates that the mice have a genetic mutation or abnormality.\n3. \"intragenic deletion\" - This is a type of genetic mutation that involves the loss of genetic material within a gene. In this case, the mutation is located within the SNRPN gene.\n4. \"Snrpn\" - This is the gene that is affected by the mutation in the mice.\n5. \"PWS\" - This is the disease or disorder that is being studied in the paragraph. It is abbreviated from \"Prader-Willi syndrome.\"\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* PWS (Prader-Willi syndrome)\n* Snrpn (the gene that is affected by the mutation in the mice)"},
