However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the \"Disease\" entity being referred to is likely \"Diabetes Mellitus\" (DM).\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The paragraph mentions \"haplotypes\" and \"alleles,\" which are genetic terms commonly used in the context of genetic disorders, including DM.\n2. The phrase \"haplotypes were found\" suggests that the study is focused on identifying specific genetic variations or combinations of genetic variations, which is a common approach in genetic research related to DM.\n3. The mention of \"A\" as a haplotype further supports the inference that the disease being referred to is DM, as \"A\" is one of the most common alleles associated with the disease.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the genetic terms used in the paragraph, it can be inferred that the \"Disease\" entity being referred to is Diabetes Mellitus."},
