T-PLL - This stands for T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, which is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow.\n2. ATM - This stands for ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene, which is a gene that plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the genetic material and preventing cancer.\n3. Cancer - The paragraph mentions \"tumours\" which are abnormal growths of cells that can be cancerous.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are T-PLL, ATM, and cancer."},
