It is a deficiency of the hexosaminidase A enzyme, which is involved in the breakdown of certain lipids in the body.\n2. Alpha-subunit processing: This is a process that is involved in the synthesis of the hexosaminidase A enzyme. The substitution at position W474C in the alpha-subunit may interfere with this process, leading to a deficiency of the enzyme.\n3. Aberrant splicing: This refers to the abnormal splicing of RNA molecules, which can result in the production of abnormal proteins. In this case, the base substitution at position 13 of exon 13 may lead to aberrant splicing of the alpha-subunit, contributing to the Hex A deficiency."},
