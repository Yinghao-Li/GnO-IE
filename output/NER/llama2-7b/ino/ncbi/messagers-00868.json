PAX6 mutation: a genetic mutation affecting the PAX6 gene, which is responsible for the development of the eye and other structures during embryonic development.\n3. Missense mutations: a type of genetic mutation that results in a change in the DNA sequence of a gene, leading to a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein produced by that gene.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
