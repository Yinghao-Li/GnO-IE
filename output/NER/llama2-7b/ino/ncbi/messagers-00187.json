Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"disease\" entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"A - T patients\" - These are individuals who have the genetic disorder known as ataxia-telangiectasia (AT).\n2. \"Oblige A - T heterozygotes\" - These are individuals who are carriers of the AT mutation, meaning they have one copy of the mutated gene and one normal copy.\n3. \"Normal controls\" - This group consists of individuals who do not have the AT mutation and are serving as a reference for comparison.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* AT (ataxia-telangiectasia)\n* AT mutation\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
