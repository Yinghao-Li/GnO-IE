To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Data presented here\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the information or evidence being presented related to a disease.\n2. \"conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific type of protein that is involved in a disease.\n3. \"CUG - binding protein\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific protein that is involved in a disease.\n4. \"may mediate the trans - dominant effect of the RNA\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the effect of a disease on another disease.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Data presented here\n* conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein\n* CUG - binding protein\n* RNA (the disease effect of which is mediated by CUG - BP)"},
