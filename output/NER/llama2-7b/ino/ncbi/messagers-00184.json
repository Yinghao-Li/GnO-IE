    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Ataxia - telangiectasia (ATM): This is the disease that the paragraph is focused on detecting carriers of. Ataxia - telangiectasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and causes progressive loss of coordination and balance, as well as other symptoms.\n2. G2 phase: This is a phase of the cell cycle, which is a series of stages that cells go through as they divide and replicate their DNA. In the context of the paragraph, G2 phase refers to the stage of the cell cycle in which the chromosomes are being replicated.\n3. Chromosomal radiosensitivity: This refers to the sensitivity of cells to the effects of radiation, specifically in the context of the cell cycle. In the paragraph, the radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes is being measured to detect heterozygous carriers of the ATM gene.\n4. Peripheral blood lymphocytes: These are a type of white blood cell that is found in the bloodstream. In the paragraph, the radiosensitivity of these cells is being measured to detect carriers of the ATM gene."},
