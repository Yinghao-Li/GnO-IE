    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the following \"Disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. Deletions\n2. Substitutions\n3. Splice sites\n4. Codons\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Deletions: The paragraph mentions \"single-nucleotide events\" that involve deletions, which are genetic changes that result in the loss of one nucleotide base from a DNA sequence.\n2. Substitutions: The paragraph also mentions \"substitutions,\" which are genetic changes that result in the replacement of one nucleotide base with another.\n3. Splice sites: Splice sites are specific sequences in DNA where the splicing machinery of the cell joins together different exons (regions of RNA transcripts) to form a mature RNA molecule. The paragraph mentions that some of the new molecular defects alter splice sites.\n4. Codons: Codons are the sequences of three nucleotide bases that code for specific amino acids in proteins. The paragraph does not provide any information about codons specifically, but it does mention that some of the new molecular defects alter codons."},
