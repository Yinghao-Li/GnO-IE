Mutation: The mutation in exon 4 of the gene is the disease entity in this paragraph.\n2. Homozygosity: The paragraph states that all four patients are homozygous for the mutation in exon 4, which means they have two copies of the mutated allele.\n3. Heterozygosity: The parents of patient 2 are described as being heterozygous for the mutation, which means they have one copy of the mutated allele and one copy of the normal allele.\n\nSo, the three disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mutation\n2. Homozygosity\n3. Heterozygosity"},
