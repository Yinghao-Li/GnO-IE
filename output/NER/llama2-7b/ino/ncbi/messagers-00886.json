To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Factor B deficiency\" - This is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. \"C2 deficiency\" - This is also a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\nFactor B deficiency\nC2 deficiency\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
