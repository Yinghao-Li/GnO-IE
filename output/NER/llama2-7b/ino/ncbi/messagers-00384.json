BRCA1: This is a disease-related gene that is associated with breast and ovarian cancer. The paragraph mentions that some individuals display a distinct allelic pattern for this gene.\n2. Ashkenazi: This is a disease-related haplotype, which is a specific set of genetic markers that are inherited together on a single chromosome.
