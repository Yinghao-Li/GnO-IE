HFE protein: This is a protein that is associated with a genetic disorder called hemochromatosis, which is characterized by excessive iron accumulation in the body.\n2. Transferrin (TfR): Transferrin is a protein that is responsible for transporting iron in the bloodstream.\n3. Hemochromatosis: This is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron accumulation in the body, which can lead to organ damage and other health problems.\n\nSo, in the paragraph, the overexpression of the wild-type HFE protein is shown to decrease the affinity of the TfR for transferrin, which suggests that the HFE protein may play a role in regulating iron metabolism and transport in cells."},
