To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Genomic mutations\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a change in the DNA sequence of an organism that can lead to disease.\n2. \"Effects on cDNA\" - This is also a disease entity, as it refers to the impact of genomic mutations on the expression of genes, which can lead to disease.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Genomic mutations\n2. Effects on cDNA"},
