Identify the entities in the sentence:\n\nSentence: These mutations resulted in the absence or a dramatic decrease of CPO activity.\n\nEntities:\n\n* Mutations\n* CPO (cytosolic phospholipase A2) activity\n2. Determine whether each entity is a disease or not:\n\nMutations: Not a disease (a genetic change)\nCPO activity: Not a disease (a biochemical process)\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is \"mutations\"."},
