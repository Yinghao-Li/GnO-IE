To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Defective thrombosis\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to an abnormal or impaired formation of blood clots.\n2. \"mutant mice\" - These are organisms that have a genetic mutation, which can lead to the development of a disease. In this case, the mutation is likely to be related to the thrombosis.\n3. \"in vivo model of vascular injury\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a living organism (in this case, mice) that has been subjected to some form of injury or damage to the vascular system.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Defective thrombosis\n2. Mutant mice\n3. Vascular injury"},
