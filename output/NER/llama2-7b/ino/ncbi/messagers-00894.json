    {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"Disease\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Although emerin was abundant in the membranes of cardiomyocyte nuclei , it was absent from many non - myocyte cells in the heart .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Emerin\" - This is a protein that is specifically mentioned in the paragraph, so it could be a disease entity.\n2. \"Cardiomyocyte\" - This is a type of cell that is found in the heart, and it is mentioned that emerin is abundant in the membranes of these cells. This suggests that a disease that affects cardiomyocytes may be involved.\n3. \"Non-myocyte cells\" - This phrase suggests that there are other types of cells in the heart that are not affected by the disease. These cells could be involved in the disease process or could be a target of the disease.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the disease entities in the paragraph could be:\n\n* Emerin (a protein that is present in cardiomyocyte membranes)\n* Cardiomyocyte disease (a disease that affects cardiomyocytes)\n* Non-myocyte cell disease (a disease that affects other types of cells in the heart)"},

Here are the disease entities that can be identified in the paragraph:\n\n* Emerin (a protein that is present in cardiomyocyte membranes)\n* Cardiomyocyte disease (a disease that affects cardiomyocytes)\n\nThese are the only disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Please present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\".\n\nMake sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here are the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph, presented in a Markdown table:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Emerin (a protein that is present in cardiomyocyte membranes) |\n| Cardiomyocyte disease (a disease that affects cardiomyocytes) |\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}
