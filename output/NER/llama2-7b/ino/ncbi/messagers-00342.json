To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"SCA3\" - This is a disease entity, as it is a specific medical condition (Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3).\n2. \"gaze-evoked nystagmus\" - This is a symptom of the disease, as it is a type of eye movement disorder that is associated with SCA3.\n3. \"saccade hypometria\" - This is another symptom of the disease, as it refers to a decrease in the speed or range of eye movements.\n4. \"smooth pursuit gain\" - This is also a symptom of the disease, as it refers to a decrease in the ability to track a moving object with smooth eye movements.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* SCA3 (Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3)\n\nThe symptoms mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Gaze-evoked nystagmus\n* Saccade hypometria\n* Smooth pursuit gain"},
