    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Mutations of the human PAX6 gene\" - This is the disease entity. It is a mutation in a specific gene (PAX6) that is associated with a particular disease (aniridia).\n2. \"aniridia\" - This is the disease entity. It is the condition that is caused by the mutation in the PAX6 gene.\n3. \"a rare dominant malformation of the eye\" - This is a descriptive term that provides additional information about the disease entity. It indicates that aniridia is a rare condition that affects the eye in a dominant manner, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mutations of the human PAX6 gene\n2. Aniridia\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
