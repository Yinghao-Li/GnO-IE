COL17A1 - This is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the structure and function of collagen, which is a key component of connective tissue. Mutations in this gene have been associated with a variety of genetic disorders, including osteogenesis imperfecta, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and other collagen-related disorders.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Osteogenesis imperfecta\n2. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\n\nNote that these are just examples of diseases that have been associated with mutations in the COL17A1 gene, and there may be other diseases that have not been identified in the paragraph."},
