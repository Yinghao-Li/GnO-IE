    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"I113F\" and \"T312S\" are mutations, which are changes in the DNA sequence of a gene. These are the disease entities in the paragraph.\n2. \"I113F\" and \"T312S\" are specific mutations that have been identified in the context of a particular disease. In this case, they are associated with a genetic disorder.\n3. \"unrelated alleles\" refers to the fact that these mutations are found in different individuals, and are therefore not inherited together.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"I113F\" and \"T312S\", which are specific mutations associated with a genetic disorder."},
