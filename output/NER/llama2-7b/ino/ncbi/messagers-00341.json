However, based on the context, we can identify the following \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. Smooth pursuit gain: This is not a disease entity, but rather a measure of eye movement function.\n2. Trinucleotide repeats: This is also not a disease entity, but rather a genetic marker that is associated with certain neurological disorders, such as fragile X syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"fragile X syndrome,\" which is a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of trinucleotide repeats on the X chromosome."},
