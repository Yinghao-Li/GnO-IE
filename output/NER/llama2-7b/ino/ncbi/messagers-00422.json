To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Significant intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variability\" - This phrase suggests that there is a range of different symptoms or characteristics present in individuals with the mutations, both within and between families.\n2. \"TWIST mutations\" - TWIST is a gene that has been associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders.\n3. \"FGFR mutations\" - FGFR stands for \"fibroblast growth factor receptor,\" and mutations in this gene have been linked to a range of diseases, including cancer, developmental disorders, and bone disorders.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* TWIST mutations\n* FGFR mutations"},
