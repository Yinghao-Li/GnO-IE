TSD - TSD stands for \"Total Serum Digoxin\" which is not a disease, but rather a laboratory test used to measure the level of digoxin in the blood.\n2. Hex A deficiency - Hex A is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hexosaminidase A, an enzyme important for the breakdown of certain fats in the body. The deficiency of hexosaminidase A can lead to the accumulation of certain fats in the body, including GM1 ganglioside, which is associated with Tay-Sachs disease.\n3. Tay-Sachs disease - Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder caused by the absence or deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, which results in the accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in the body. Tay-Sachs disease is a fatal genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system and can lead to progressive nerve damage, loss of motor skills, and death in children."},
