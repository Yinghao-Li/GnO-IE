Mutation: The paragraph mentions a mutation in the DNA sequence, which is a type of disease entity.\n2. Termination codon: The termination codon is a specific sequence of nucleotides that signals the termination of protein synthesis, and its presence in the mutation mentioned in the paragraph could lead to a disease entity.\n3. Amino acid position 29: The specific amino acid position mentioned in the paragraph is also a disease entity, as it refers to a specific location in the protein sequence where the mutation occurs."},

Disease: The mutation changes the codon for glutamine to a termination codon at amino acid position 29, which could lead to a disease.\n\nI have removed the irrelevant entities, such as \"termination codon\" and \"amino acid position 29\", as they are not directly related to the concept of disease."},
