To identify the disease entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Tumor suppressor gene\": This refers to a gene that helps to prevent the growth and spread of tumors.\n2. \"PTEN\": This is the name of the specific tumor suppressor gene that was isolated in the paragraph.\n3. \"MMAC1\": This is another name for PTEN.\n4. \"Prostate cancer\": This is the type of cancer that the researchers were studying in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Tumor suppressor gene (PTEN/MMAC1)\n* Prostate cancer"},
