G279A substitution: This is a genetic mutation or variation that occurs in the signal peptide of a protein. It is described as a \"substitution\" because it involves the replacement of one amino acid with another. In this case, the amino acid at position -1 of the signal peptide is replaced with another amino acid, G279A.\n2. Affected individuals: This term refers to individuals who have the G279A substitution in their genetic material and are therefore affected by the disease or condition associated with this mutation.\n\nSo, the two disease entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. G279A substitution\n2. Affected individuals"},
