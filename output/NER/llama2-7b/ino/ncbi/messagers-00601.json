Identify the keywords:\n * Nonsense mutation\n * Exon\n * Gene\n * Complement\n * Deficiency\n2. Determine the relationships:\n * Nonsense mutation is located in exon 4 of the human complement C9 gene.\n * The nonsense mutation causes Japanese complement C9 deficiency.\n3. Identify the disease entities:\n * Disease: Japanese complement C9 deficiency\n * Disease: Nonsense mutation\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Japanese complement C9 deficiency\n* Nonsense mutation"},
