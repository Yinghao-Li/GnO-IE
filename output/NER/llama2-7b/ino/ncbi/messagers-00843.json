    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the following \"disease\" entities are mentioned:\n\n1. G197W: This refers to a point mutation in the protein sequence, specifically a glutamine (Q) to tryptophan (W) substitution at position 197. This mutation is often associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.\n2. W427R: This refers to another point mutation in the protein sequence, specifically a tryptophan (W) to arginine (R) substitution at position 427. Like G197W, this mutation is also associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.\n3. 390delGly: This refers to an in-frame deletion of the amino acid glycine (Gly) at position 390. This mutation can lead to the loss of function of the protein and is associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nTherefore, the three \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. G197W\n2. W427R\n3. 390delGly"},
