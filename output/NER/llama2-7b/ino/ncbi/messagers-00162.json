    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Rescued embryos\" - This refers to embryos that have been treated or saved in some way, possibly to study their development or to correct a genetic defect.\n2. \"severe anterior truncations\" - This refers to a specific abnormality or defect in the development of the embryo, specifically a truncation of the anterior (front) part of the embryo.\n3. \"indicating a second important role for Smad4 in anterior patterning during embryogenesis\" - This sentence suggests that the abnormality in the embryo's development is related to the function of a protein called Smad4, which is involved in the process of patterning the embryo's anterior (front) region.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"Rescued embryos\" (which may be affected by a genetic defect or disease)\n* \"severe anterior truncations\" (a specific abnormality or defect in the development of the embryo)\n* \"Smad4\" (the protein that is involved in the abnormality or defect)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

Let me know if you have any further questions."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Please present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\".\n\nMake sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},
