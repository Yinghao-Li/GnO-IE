Identify the keywords related to disease:\n * Disease\n * Mutation\n * HLA haplotypes\n * Caucasian admixture\n2. Identify the entities that are associated with these keywords:\n * Populations\n * Allele frequency\n * Caucasians\n3. Determine if the identified entities are related to disease:\n * Yes, the 845 G - - > A mutation is associated with disease (specifically, it is always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that it may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* 845 G - - > A mutation\n* HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians\n\nThese entities are associated with disease because they are related to the introduction of the 845 G - - > A mutation into populations, which may be associated with disease."},
