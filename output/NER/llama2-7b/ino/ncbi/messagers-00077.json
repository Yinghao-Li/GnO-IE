Polymorphism: This refers to the presence of multiple forms of a gene or genetic variant in a population.\n2.

Rsal restriction site: This is a specific genetic marker or restriction site that is created by the Cys282Tyr mutation.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Polymorphism\n2.
