To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"C5D\" - This could be a disease entity, as it is a term used in the context of coagulation disorders.\n2. \"pyogenic infection\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a type of infection that causes inflammation and the formation of pus.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* C5D (Coagulation disorder)\n* Pyogenic infection (Bacterial infection)"},
