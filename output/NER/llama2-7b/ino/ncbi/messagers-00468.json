    {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"Disease\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Mice with a larger deletion involving both Snrpn and the putative PWS - IC lack expression of the imprinted genes Zfp127 ( mouse homologue of ZNF127 ) , Ndn and Ipw , and manifest several phenotypes common to PWS infants .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Mice\" - These are the organisms being studied in the paragraph.\n2. \"deletion\" - This refers to the genetic alteration that has occurred in the mice, specifically the loss of genetic material on both copies of the Snrpn gene.\n3. \"PWS\" - This stands for \"Prader-Willi syndrome,\" which is a genetic disorder that is characterized by a range of symptoms including growth delays, obesity, and cognitive impairments.\n4. \"IC\" - This stands for \"imprinting center,\" which is a region of DNA that is responsible for regulating the expression of certain genes.\n5. \"Zfp127\" - This is the name of a gene that is involved in the imprinting center and is expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner.\n6. \"Ndn\" - This stands for \"Negative DNA methylation domain,\" which is a region of DNA that is involved in the regulation of gene expression.\n7. \"Ipw\" - This stands for \"Imprinted in PWS,\" which refers to the fact that these genes are imprinted in the context of Prader-Willi syndrome.\n8. \"Phenotypes\" - This refers to the physical and behavioral characteristics of an organism, such as growth delays, obesity, and cognitive impairments, that are associated with a particular disease or disorder.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)\n* Imprinting center (IC)\n* Negative DNA methylation domain (Ndn)\n* Imprinted in PWS (Ipw)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},

Here are the valid entities in the paragraph that refer to disease, presented in a Markdown table with one column titled \"Disease\":\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) |\n\nI hope this helps!
