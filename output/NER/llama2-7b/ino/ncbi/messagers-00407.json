To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Altered expression of genes\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a change in the normal functioning of genes that can lead to disease.\n2. \"regulated posttranscriptionally by CUG - BP\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the regulation of gene expression by a specific protein (CUG - BP) that is involved in disease.\n3. \"DM pathogenesis\" - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the development or progression of a disease called DM (Dystonia-Myoclonus).\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Altered expression of genes\n* Regulated posttranscriptionally by CUG - BP\n* DM pathogenesis"},
