Properdin Factor B allotype: Properdin is a protein that plays a role in the immune system, specifically in the activation of the complement system. A properdin Factor B allotype refers to a specific variation in the genetic code that determines the type of properdin protein produced by an individual.\n2. HLA-B: HLA-B is a gene that codes for a protein called major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide B (HLA-B). This protein is involved in the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to foreign substances in the body.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are Properdin Factor B allotype and HLA-B."},
