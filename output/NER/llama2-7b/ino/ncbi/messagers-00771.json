Homozygous deficiency: This refers to a genetic condition where an individual has two copies of a mutated gene, resulting in a complete loss of function of that gene.\n2. FH gene: This refers to the gene that encodes the protein fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which is involved in the regulation of phosphate metabolism.\n3. Deficiency: This refers to a lack or abnormality of a particular gene or protein, which can lead to a medical condition.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
