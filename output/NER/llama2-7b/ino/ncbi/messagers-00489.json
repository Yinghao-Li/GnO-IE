Alzheimer's disease: The paragraph mentions the accumulation of a specific precursor level of the W474C alpha-subunit, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n2. Normal alpha-subunit precursor levels: The comparison of the precursor level of the W474C alpha-subunit to the normal alpha-subunit precursor levels suggests that there is a deviation or abnormality in the precursor level, which could be indicative of a disease state.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities that can be identified in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Alzheimer's disease\n2. Abnormal or deviant disease state (implied by the comparison to normal precursor levels)"},
