    {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"Disease\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: These results indicate the usefulness of cycloheximide treatment in evaluating the abnormal processing of mRNA due to splice - site mutations , because ( i ) aberrant splicing often generates a premature termination codon , ( ii ) transcripts with premature termination codons can occur at low or undetectable levels due to nonsense - mediated mRNA decay , and ( iii ) the levels of these transcripts can be increased by cycloheximide .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's break down the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. \"abnormal processing of mRNA\" - This entity refers to the abnormal or irregular way in which mRNA (messenger RNA) is processed in cells.\n2. \"splice-site mutations\" - This entity refers to mutations that occur in the splice sites of mRNA, which are the regions where exons (genetic information) are spliced together to form a mature mRNA molecule.\n3. \"premature termination codon\" - This entity refers to a codon that signals the termination of protein synthesis prematurely, before the normal termination codon (usually UAA) is reached.\n4. \"nonsense-mediated mRNA decay\" - This entity refers to a process by which cells degrade mRNA molecules that contain premature termination codons, which can lead to a decrease in the levels of the corresponding protein.\n5. \"cycloheximide\" - This entity refers to a chemical compound that is used to inhibit the activity of ribosomes, which are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis.\n\nSo, the \"disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. \"abnormal processing of mRNA\" - This can lead to the production of aberrant proteins, which can cause various diseases.\n2. \"splice-site mutations\" - These mutations can lead to the production of aberrant proteins, which can cause various diseases.\n3. \"premature termination codon\" - This can lead to the production of truncated proteins, which can cause various diseases.\n4. \"nonsense-mediated mRNA decay\" - This can lead to the degradation of mRNA molecules that contain premature termination codons, which can cause various diseases.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Please remove irrelevant entities and only keep the entities that clearly refer to Disease."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course! Here are the entities that clearly refer to \"Disease\" in the provided paragraph:\n\n1. \"abnormal processing of mRNA\"\n2. \"splice-site mutations\"\n3. \"premature termination codon\"\n\nThese entities are directly related to the concept of disease, as they all involve abnormalities in the processing and production of proteins, which can lead to various diseases."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Please present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\".\n\nMake sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Here are the valid entities related to \"Disease\" in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| abnormal processing of mRNA |\n| splice-site mutations |\n| premature termination codon |\n\nI hope this helps!
