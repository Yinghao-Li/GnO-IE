To identify the \"disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"novel Arg362Ser mutation\" - This is a mutation in the CYP27 gene, which is a disease entity.\n2. \"sterol 27 - hydroxylase gene\" - This is the gene that contains the mutation, and it is also a disease entity.\n3. \"pre - mRNA splicing\" - This is a process that occurs in the cell and is related to gene expression, but it is not a disease entity.\n4. \"enzyme activity\" - This is a process that occurs in the cell and is related to gene expression, but it is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"novel Arg362Ser mutation\"\n* \"sterol 27 - hydroxylase gene\""},
