Uniparental disomy: This is a genetic condition where an individual has two copies of a single chromosome instead of the usual one from each parent.\n2. Non-Robertsonian translocations: These are chromosomal abnormalities that involve the exchange of genetic material between two chromosomes, but do not involve the sex chromosomes (X and Y).\n3. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS): This is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation on the paternal chromosome 15, characterized by obesity, hyperphagia, and intellectual disability.\n\nSo, the paragraph is mentioning that uniparental disomy associated with unbalanced segregation of non-Robertsonian translocations has not been observed in a case of PWS."},
