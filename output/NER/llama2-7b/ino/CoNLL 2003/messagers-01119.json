ORE: This is likely an abbreviation for \"Oceanic Reef,\" which could be a shipping company or a port operator.\n2. Maritime Queen: This is the name of a ship, which could be a vessel owned or operated by ORE or another organization.\n3. 70,000 tonnes: This is the gross tonnage of the ship, which is a measure of the ship's size.\n4. Dampier / Kaohsiung: These are likely the ports of departure and arrival, respectively, for the ship.\n5. 20-30/12: This could be the date of departure or arrival of the ship, but without more context it's difficult to say for sure.\n6. $ 5.25 fio: This is likely a price or rate for the shipment of goods, but without more context it's difficult to say what the exact amount is or what the \"fio\" stands for.\n7. 35,000 / 30,000: These are likely the quantities of goods being transported by the ship, with the first number being the total quantity and the second number being the quantity being transported by ORE.\n8. China Steel: This is the name of a company that may be involved in the shipping or transportation of goods.\n\nBased on this analysis, the \"Organization\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* ORE (Oceanic Reef)\n* Maritime Queen (the ship)\n* China Steel (a company involved in the shipping or transportation of goods)"},
