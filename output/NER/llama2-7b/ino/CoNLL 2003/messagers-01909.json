To identify the \"Location\" entities in the paragraph, we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"Royal Clipper\" - This is a ship, so it is not a location.\n2. \"Maracaibo\" - This is a location, specifically a city in Venezuela.\n3. \"Fos\" - This could be an abbreviation or acronym, but without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact location.\n4. \"19/12-2/1\" - This is a date range, specifically from December 19th to February 1st.\n5. \"$ 9.90 fio\" - This is a price, so it is not a location.\n6. \"20,000 shinc\" - This is a quantity, specifically 20,000 tons of coal.\n7. \"Coe and Clerici\" - This is a company or organization, so it is not a location.\n\nTherefore, the \"Location\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Maracaibo (city in Venezuela)\n* Fos (location, possibly an abbreviation or acronym)\n\nI hope this helps!
