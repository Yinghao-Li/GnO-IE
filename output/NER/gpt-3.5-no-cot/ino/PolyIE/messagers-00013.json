Time dependent DFT calculations show that the absorption band in the longer wavelength is mainly attributed to the transition from HOMO delocalized in the D - A backbone to LUMO localized in DTP units for all the polymers . On the other hand , the absorption in the shorter wavelength is largely contributed by the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1 , which is similar to π - π * transition in polythiophene judging by the shape of the orbitals .
