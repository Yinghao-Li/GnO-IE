Without any device optimization , the device afforded an open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.50 V , a short - circuit current density ( J sc ) of 1.42 mA / cm^2 , a fill factor ( FF ) of 42.4 % , and a preliminary power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 0.30 % under an AM 1.5 simulated solar light at 100 mW / cm^2 ( Figure 7 ) .

On the basis of this new building block , we have designed and synthesized a series of new conjugated copolymers containing electron - rich unit benzodithiophene or electron - deficient unit bithiazole or benzothiadiazole and homopolymers . The optical properties and HOMO / LUMO levels can be manipulated through adjusting copolymerized building blocks .

Dithieno-[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide and its homopolymer exhibit low HOMO of -6.2 eV and relatively low LUMO of -3.1 eV , indicating that it is relatively weak n - type building block . Increase in electron - donating strength of the counit leads to upshift in both HOMO and LUMO , while increase in electron - withdrawing strength of the counit leads to downshift in both HOMO and LUMO .
