On the other hand , the fused rings can make the polymer backbone more rigid and coplanar , therefore enhancing effective π - conjugation , lowering bandgap , and extending absorption . 28 - 31 Therefore , fused - ring building blocks are widely used in synthesis of conjugated polymers . 32 - 34 For example , the large planar benzodithiophene ( BDT ) unit has emerged as an attractive building block for conjugated polymers . 35 Benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene ( 7 , Figure 2 ) with a curved structure prevents a fully conjugated pathway between substituents at the 2 - and 6 - positions .

This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation . Additionally , compared to a single thiophene ring , it must be pointed out that due to the large resonance stabilization energy of BDT , the delocalization of electrons from the BDT unit into the backbone is less favorable than from the thiophene ring .
