In this study , three kinds of low band gap copolymers integrating DTP as the donor block and the most - used BT as the acceptor unit were synthesized . Different numbers of thienyl ( T ) as spacers were introduced along the copolymer main chain to investigate the effect on optical , electrochemical and photovoltaic performance .
