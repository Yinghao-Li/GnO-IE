This approach has provided a remarkable short - circuit current density ( J SC ) of 16 mA / cm^2 , 3 whereas , in general , the V OC has suffered 4 because of a higher than the HOMO optimal energy level in order to pursue a lower bandgap . In the PSCs community , poly(2,7 - carbazole - altdithienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDTBT ) is one excellent exam - ple for a low HOMO ( -5.45 eV ) as required by the ' ideal ' πconjugated polymers , which led to a high V OC value over 0.8 V and outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures . 5 The initial PCE reached 3.6 % 6 in a typical BHJ device and has been subsequently improved to exceeding 6 % by BHJ layer thickness optimization and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures . 7 However , the bandgap of PCDTBT is still relatively larger than the proposed 1.5 - 1.7 eV of the ideal polymers for PCEs exceeding 10 % . Recently , to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT without sacrificing its high V OC , Hsu et al . 8 and our group 9 independently reported PCDTBT - based ladder - type polymers with forced planarity of which device performance showed impressive PCEs of up to 4.59 % with reduced bandgap ( ca . 0.2 eV ) in comparison with that of PCDTBT . However , the multiple synthetic steps for the ladder - type PCDTBTs have restricted the realization for their usage in BHJ devices . Herein , we present an easily obtainable selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , poly(2,7 - carbazole - alt - diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDSeBT ) by replacing thiophenes with selenophene rings in the polymer backbone . Such a structural modification would be expected the lower - lying LUMO with the HOMO being largely unaffected due to the individual effects of the smaller ionization potential ( IP ) and almost the same electronegativity of selenium relative to sulfur atom . 10 In addition , interchain - charge transfer should be facilitated by intermolecular Se ° ° ° Se contacts , most likely leading to a widen absorption band and enhanced mobility that are desirable for high photocurrents . 11 Our preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic properties of PCDSeBT in typical BHJ devices with [ 6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) shows a highly respectrable PCE of 4.12 % on account of the high J SC and V OC .
