V eff = V 0 - V , where V 0 is the voltage at which J L = J D and V is the applied voltage . When the reverse voltage is greater than 2 V , recombination will be suppressed because of a high internal electric field and thus the current density becomes saturated ( J sat ) . Consequently , P(E , T ) = J ph / J sat could be used to describe the charge dissociation probability . The charge dissociation probability of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based cells was estimated to be 0.86 , 0.94 , 0.98 , and 0.92 , respectively . The highest exciton dissociation of the PffBB-14 - based device is anticipated to give rise to the best photovoltaic performance among these series of polymers . Figure 7 demonstrates the dependence of V oc and J sc against light intensity , which could be used to describe the recombination process in BHJ films . The V oc is directly proportional to the incident light intensity in the semilogarithmic plot with a slope of kT / q , which describes bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film , where k represents the Boltzmann constant , T is the Kelvin temperature , and q is the elementary charge . Trap - assisted recombination exists if the slope is larger than kT / q. 42 Among devices fabricated , the PffBB-14 - based cell exhibited the smallest slope of 1.10 kT / q , suggesting the least trap - assisted recombination . Bimolecular recombination was also investigated by measuring the dependence of J sc against light intensity , in which the exponential factor α in the power law of J sc ∝ P light α is used Article to indicate bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film . The closer the estimated α to 1.0 , the weaker the bimolecular recombination occurs in the device . 43 Obviously , with α = 0.98 , the PffBB-14 - based device would exhibit the least occurrence of bimolecular recombination in the active layer . In contrast , the PffBB-10 - based device showed an α value of 0.86 , indicating that the bimolecular recombination loss was severe in its BHJ film . These results consistently indicate that the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend with superior balanced charge carrier transport exhibits the least recombination loss among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs , thus affording the highest J sc and FF . Morphology of the Active Layer . AFM images of PffBBn : PC71BM blended thin films were obtained to investigate their microphase separation behavior and the corresponding AFM height and phase images recorded in the tapping mode are shown in Figure 8 . Good miscibility could be observed in all of the PffBB - n : PC71BM blended thin films , which gives rise to desirable phase separation ."},
