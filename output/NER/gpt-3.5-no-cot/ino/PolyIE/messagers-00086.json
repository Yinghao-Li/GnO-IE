Using PBDT - TDPP - S as electron donor and PC71BM as electron acceptor , the resulting PSCs exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a PCE of 4.89 % , an open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.84 V , a shortcircuit current ( J SC ) of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 56.0 % . To our best knowledge , the efficiency is among the highest reported to date for side - chain D - A conjugated copolymers and is twice higher than that of the main - chain D - A counterpart polymer PBDTDPP - OR in the single BHJ PSCs . synthesized by a common Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as catalyst with a high yield of 78.7 % , as shown in Scheme 1 .

The resulting PBDT - TDPP - S showed good solubility in common organic solvents , such as chlorobenzene , o - dichlorobenzene , and dichloromethane ( DCM ) , but PBDT - DPP was nearly not soluble in them . Gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis showed that PBDT - TDPP - S has a numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) of 1.34 × 10 ^ 4 g mol^-1 with a polydispersity index of 1.27 ( Figure S1 ) . Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) indicated that PBDT - TDPP - S has high thermal stability with a degradation temperature ( T d ) of 364 ° C at 5 % weight loss .
