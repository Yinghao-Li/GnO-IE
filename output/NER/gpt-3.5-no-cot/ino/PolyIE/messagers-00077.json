The increased J sc of PIDT - C12NT may be also attributed to the enhanced film absorption coefficient so that more sunlight can be absorbed and then generate more excitons , finally produce more charges . It is also worth pointing out that the accuracy of the J sc results was further confirmed by external quantum efficiency ( EQEs ) measurement under illumination of monochromatic light . The EQE spectra are shown in Figure 6b . The calculated current density from the EQE measurement were 4.18 , 7.83 , and 9.72 mA cm^-2 for PIDT - EHNT , PIDT - DTNT , and PIDT - C12NT respectively , which show mismatches with that of determined from current density measurement of three devices in the range of 3 - 5 % . One can clearly observe the distinctly improved EQE values of polymers by switching the thiophene spacer from the branched 2 - ethylhexyl side chain ( PIDT - EHNT ) to linear hexyl side chain ( PIDT - DTNT ) , which was further improved for the bithiophene spacer with linear dodecyl side chain attached on the optimized position ( PIDT - C12NT ) . In conclusion , three donor - acceptor type low band gap conjugated polymers based on indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) and naphtho[1,2 - c:5,6 - c]bis(1,2,5 - thiadiazole ) ( NT ) with differ - ent thiophene spacers were synthesized by Stille copolymerization . All polymers showed relatively deep HOMO levels that consequently lead to high open circuit voltage of the solar cell devices . It was shown that the improvement of the processability , backbone planarity , charge carrier mobility and optimal morphology of bulk heterojunction film blended with PC71BM can be achieved by switching the spacer between the IDT and NT units ."},
