The acceptor units were varied from BT to BO for adjusting the energy levels and optimizing the structures of polymers . Both copolymers possess good solubility , high thermal stability , broad absorption , and low bandgap and exhibit not only high field - effect mobilities but also high photovoltaic properties . The hole mobilities reach 0.43 and 0.34 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO film , respectively . Bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated by using PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO as electron donor and PC71BM as acceptor show a power conversion efficiency of 3.22 % and 5.07 % , respectively , under illumination of AM1.5 G , 100 mW cm^-2 . Both the hole mobilities and PCEs are among the highest values in the current reports based on naphthodithiophene - based polymers , indicating that \" zigzag \" naphthodithiophene - based D - A copolymers are very promising for application as solution - processable organic semiconductors in optoelectronic devices . Solution - processable organic semiconductors are attractive for their potential applicability in low - cost electronics such as organic photovoltaics ( OPVs ) and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) and compatibility with plastic substrates , thereby enabling mechanically flexible circuits . 1 - 3 Current state - of - the - art polymeric materials have allowed for the fabrication of OFETs with mobilities of over 1 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and OPV devices with power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of over 9 % . 4,5 Although remarkable progress has been made in the design and synthesis of p - type polymer semiconductors , their performances in terms of hole mobilities and photovoltaic properties remain to be further optimized and maximized . Moreover , a versatile building unit that can be utilized for polymers with both high transistor and photovoltaic performances is highly desired for effective material development . 6 An important strategy that has proved to be the most successful in achieving both high performing OPV and OFET devices is the donor - acceptor ( D - A ) approach . By judicious selection of the donor and the acceptor units , the D - A copolymer architecture enables engineering of the electronic structure including energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) , the energy band gap , and light harvesting properties as well as charge transport properties . 7 Among the currently available classes of materials , thiophenefused polycyclic heteroaromatics have aroused great interest due to their high charge transport properties ."},
