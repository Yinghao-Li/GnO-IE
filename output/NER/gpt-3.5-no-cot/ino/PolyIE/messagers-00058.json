The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / LiF / Al , where the polymers ( P1- P7 ) were used as electron donors and PC71BM ( or PC61BM ) was used as an electron acceptor . To optimize the morphology and ordering structure , different volume percentages of 1,8diiodooctane were added . 43 Figure 4 shows the current density versus voltage ( J - V ) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW / cm^2 . The V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE values of the PSC devices are summarized in Table 3 .

P5 , P6 , and P7 blended with PC61BM showed higher PCE values than when they were blended with PC71BM in spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , which is most likely due to the lower miscibility of those polymers with PC71BM . 44 The V OC of these random terpolymers increased in the order P2 ( 0.74 V ) ∼ P3 ( 0.74 V ) < P4 ( 0.76 V ) < P5 ( 0.79 V ) < P6 ( 0.82 V ) . The trend in the V OC of the PSCs can be explained by the HOMO energy level of the polymers because the V OC is typically linearly proportional to the difference in energy between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor . 45 However , the PCE of the random terpolymers showed a the nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % in the order P3 ( 5.61 % ) > P4 ( 5.26 % ) > P2 ( 4.91 % ) > P5 ( 3.02 % ) > P6 ( 2.09 % ) ; this was consistent with the observed trend of the J SC . P3 exhibited the highest PCE value of 5.61 % among all polymers , including P1 and P7 , which was attributed to the broad absorption and increased V OC due to the deeper HOMO energy level ."},
