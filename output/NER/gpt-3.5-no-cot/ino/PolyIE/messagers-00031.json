PFDTBT showed a maximum PCE of 2.2 % , and PFDTBT derivatives containing branched alkyl chains ( BisDMO - PFDTBT ) showed higher PCEs . 10,11 Some molecules and polymers that have flat structures such as fluorene , 12 - 16 anthracene , 17 and pyrene 18,19 have been reported to form excimers or aggregates by strong interchain π - π interactions . Excimer formation could affect the emission properties of molecules or polymers , therefore , the excimer or exciplex formation has been used as a fluorescence probe for molecular recognition . 19 In organic photovoltaic devices , π - π interactions between low - band gap donor polymers are important for charge transportation . Enhanced π - π interactions in p - type donor polymers could improve their chargetransport ability , and thus increase short - circuit currents in solar cells . In this study we report on a new approach to improve PCE of OPVs by enhancing the interchain π - π interaction . To do this we introduced flat perylene units into the conjugated polymers . We synthesized poly[2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2 - thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole ) ] ( PFDTBT ) , poly[2,2′-(9,9 - dioctylfluorene-2,7 - diyl)dithiophene - alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2 - thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole ) ] ( PFD2TBT ) , and their ter - polymers with perylene units . Optical , electrical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated . Synthetic routes and polymer structures are shown in Schemes 1 and 2 . The UV - visible absorption spectra of the synthesized polymers were recorded in both chloroform solution and as a solid thin film . PFDTBT and the ter - polymer solutions exhibited two distinct absorption bands , where the first absorption peak is at around 387 nm , corresponding to the π - π * transition of the conjugated polymer backbone , 23,24 and the second absorption band in the longer wavelength region at around 530 nm , can be attributed to the strong internal charge - transfer ( ICT ) interaction between donating and accepting groups in the main chain . 21 Peak and edge positions were almost equivalent for PFDTBT , PFDTBT_5Per and PFDTBT_10Per , but the maximum absorption peak for PFDTBT_20Per moved to a shorter wavelength region . This might be due to a decrease in the internal charge - transfer ( ICT ) interaction cause by a decreased content of electron - withdrawing DTBT monomer in the copolymer . PFD2TBT and the ter - polymer solutions also exhibited two absorption bands at around 410 and 520 nm . The absorption maxima and edges of the polymer solutions showed little dependence upon perylene contents .
