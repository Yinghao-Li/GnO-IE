The perylene units were introduced to improve the charge - transport ability by enhancing the π - π interaction between polymer chains . The resulting polymers were characterized by 1H NMR , elemental analysis , DSC , and TGA . The synthesized polymers were soluble in common organic solvents , and formed smooth and uniform spin - coated thin films . All of the polymers studied were found to exhibit good thermal stability , losing less than 5 % of their weight upon heating to approximately 350 ° C. Perylene - containing polymers showed higher field - effect mobilities than the corresponding PFDTBT or PFD2TBT polymers because of the enhanced π - π interaction between polymer chains upon the introduction of perylene units . Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al . The devices using the perylene - containing polymers showed higher short - circuit currents , and fill factors than the corresponding PFDTBT or PFD2TBT devices . One of the fabricated devices using a perylene - containing copolymer showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.16 % , with a short circuit current density of 9.61 mA / cm^2 , open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , and fill factor of 41 % . Extensive research has been carried out during the past decade on bulk heterojunction solar cells that utilize organic semiconducting materials . 1 The main advantages of organic photovoltaic devices ( OPVs ) are their lightweight , flexible nature , and their cost - effective manufacture by various printing technologies . The photoconversion process in OPVs is accomplished by efficient light absorption by conjugated polymers and accepting materials , charge separation at the interface of the donor polymer and the accepting materials , and subsequent charge collection at the electrodes . Matching the absorption of the conjugated polymer to the solar spectrum determines the ultimate performance of the solar cell . Among the variety of conjugated polymers that have been studied , poly(p - phenylenevinylene ) ( PPV ) , 2 poly(alkylfluorene ) ( PF ) , and polythiophene ( PT ) 3 derivatives are typical p - type electron donor materials . However , the performance of photovoltaic cells with these polymers is limited by their relatively large band gap energies , which are not yet optimized with respect to the solar spectrum . Therefore , the design and synthesis of new low - band gap polymers become very important to better harvest the solar spectrum , especially in the red and near - infrared ranges , which can lead to possible enhancements in the photocurrents of OPVs . 4 The most widely used approach for obtaining low - band gap structures is to utilize internal charge transfer ( ICT ) from an electron - donating to an electron - accepting moiety . 5 - 7 Some interesting structures using the ICT approach have been reported ."},
