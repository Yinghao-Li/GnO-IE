The combination of the different electron - deficient units of pyrrolo [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione ( DPP ) and thieno [ 3,4- c]pyrrole-4,6 - dione ( TPD ) can be ideal for producing broad light absorption due to the large difference between their electron - withdrawing strengths . 19,22 In addition , both units have been successfully used in D - A copolymers to produce high - performance PSCs . 26 - 33 While electron - withdrawing TPD possesses a relatively simple , symmetric , and planar structure suitable for D - A copolymers in PSCs , DPP exhibits very strong electron - withdrawing effect due to the presence of electrondeficient lactam rings and strong π - π interactions . 19,34 Herein , we report a series of novel random poly[thienyl - substituted benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene - pyrrolo [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4dione - thieno [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-4,6 - dione]copolymers ( PBDTT- DPP - TPD ) based on one electron - rich unit , thienylsubstituted benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene ( BDTT ) , and two electron - deficient units , DPP and TPD , that have complementary and broad light absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm .
