These results are explained by their much more planar conformations in the solid state . 10 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram of PCZDTB and PQCDTB , which were measured in 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate acetonitrile . As reported by Lidzey et al . , the PCZDTB oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potential were + 1.09 and -1.37 V , respectively , and the HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.44 and -2.98 eV. In the case of PQCDTB , unlike the PQA2 T ( poly[quinacridone - bithiophene ] ) reported by Takimiya et al . , a clear oxidation - reduction peak was observed . 19 This type of result has been obtained because PQCDTB was D - A structured , unlike the typical p - type structure of PQA2T. In PQCDTB , the oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potentials were + 0.89 and -1.36 V , respectively . The HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.24 and -2.99 eV , respectively . Table 2 summarizes the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers . As shown in Table 2 , the HOMO level of PQCDTB ( -5.24 eV ) was higher than that of PCZDTB by 0.2 eV because the HOMO level of the QC derivative was higher than that of carbazole . The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference between the HOMO energy levels and the optical bandgap energies . According to the calculations , the LUMO levels of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were -3.32 and -3.46 eV , respectively . They slightly differed from the levels calculated through CV , but they mostly exhibited a similar tendency . Figure 4 shows the band diagram of the energy levels that have been obtained through DFT calculations and experiments . The bandgap energies of PQCDTB and PCZDTB determined through UV - vis spectra were reported as 1.98 and 1.92 eV , respectively , which were lower than the results of the DFT calculation by 0.57 and 0.55 V. 28 Because the HOMO level is lower than the P3HT HOMO level ( -4.9 eV ) in both polymers , a relatively high air stability could be obtained . 29 In the case of PQCDTB , the LUMO level ( -3.32 eV ) was higher than the PC71BM LUMO level ( -4.0 eV ) by 0.68 eV. However , the HOMO level ( -5.24 eV ) was lower than the PEDOT : PSS HOMO level ( -5.0 eV ) by 0.24 eV. Therefore , if charge separation occurs after receiving light energy , a hole would exhibit more effective charge transport than an electron in the active layer of PQCDTB . 14,26 Figure 5 and Table 3 show the results of evaluating the characteristics of an OPV device ."},
