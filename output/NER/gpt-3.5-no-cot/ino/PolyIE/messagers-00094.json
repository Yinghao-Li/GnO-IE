The calculated I SC from the EQE was 15 % less than the measured I SC . This discrepancy might be attributed to the spectral mismatch in the NIR region and / or device degradation during measurements in air . The highest PCE of PSCs based on the PDTP - DTDPP-(Bu ) : PC 70 BM system reached 2.71 % , which was lower than the 4 - 5 % of the P3HT : PCBM devices . This could be mainly attributed to the lower V OC ( ∼ 0.4 V ) . In addition , the charge separation efficiency in the current combination might not be as high as that in P3HT : PCBM , although it was difficult to estimate the internal quantum efficiency ( IQE ) accurately due to the light interference effect in the films . This might be attributed to the smaller LUMO offset or less ideal mixing morphology between the polymer and PCBM . Nevertheless , this performance is more than double of the highest PCE ( 1.1 % ) reported to date for μmR - polymers , even when the spectral mismatch in the NIR region above was considered . Such improvement of PCE comes from relatively highefficiency photon - to - electron conversion in the broad range of the absorption in the blend film of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PCBM . Considering the high EQE obtained in the range from 650 to 950 nm , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) is a promising candidate for applications in tandem photovoltaic devices in combination with conventional visible light absorbing materials . Furthermore , comparing the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) with PDTP - DTDPP(EH ) suggests that the alkyl chain in the DPP segment has a large influence on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers . A similar phenomenon was also observed for other D - A type photovoltaic polymers . 12 Synthesis of new μmR - polymers with different alkyl chain in both the DTDPP segment and the dithieno[3,2 - b : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -d]pyrrole segment and a detailed comparison of the properties of all these polymers are now in progress . The energy loss from the low output voltage of the photovoltaic devices ( 0.38 - 0.4 V ) can be attributed to the relatively large difference between the LUMO levels of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PCBM ( i.e. , small energy difference between the HOMO of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and LUMO of PCBM ) . There is still a room to lower the LUMO level of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) from 3.63 to ∼ 4.0 eV , which is ∼ 0.3 eV higher than the LUMO level of PCBM . If we can control the mixing morphology suitable for the charge separation , this energy offset might be enough to maintain a sufficient driving force for charge transfer and the higher V OC could be expected at the same time ."},
