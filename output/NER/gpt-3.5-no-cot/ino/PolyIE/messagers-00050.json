    {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"Material Name\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 36 OPVs based on blends of benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene copolymers and PC61BM exhibited PCEs as high as 2.17 % . 37 - 40 In this paper , we report creation of a new fused - ring building block dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 8 , Figure 2 ) and its application in design and synthesis of conjugated polymers . The combination of benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene planarity and efficient π - π stacking with the electron - withdrawing capacity of the imide functionality serves as the foundation for this new class of materials . Introduction of the π - electron - deficient imide moiety can decrease the HOMO and LUMO energies of the polymers , which is necessary for air - stable polymers . Furthermore , substitution at the imide nitrogen allows introduction of functionalities and solubility improvement with varying degrees of steric bulk while not impinging on critical intermolecular π - π stacking characteristics . This motif also leaves the benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene 2 - and 7 - positions available for polymerization . Finally , the dipole moment caused by the imide could stabilize cofacial antiparallel intra - and interchain repeat unit orientations , planarize the backbone , and promote π - π stacking . 27 On the basis of this new building block , we designed and synthesized a series of conjugated copolymers : unit 8 coupled with electron - rich unit benzo[1,2b:4,5 - b 0 ] dithiophene ( P1 and P2 ) or with electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole ( P3 and P4 ) or benzo [ c ] [ 1,2,5]thiadiazole ( P5 ) and homopolymer ( P6 ) ( Figure 2 ) . The optical properties and electronic structure ( HOMO / LUMO levels and bandgap ) can be manipulated through adjusting copolymerized building blocks . ' RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization . The synthetic routes to the monomers and polymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2 . We chose very cheap , industrial product maleic anhydride as a starting material . Bromination of maleic anhydride with Br 2 gave its dibromide ( 1 ) . 41 Then , amination with alkylamine afforded the alkyl - substituted 3,4dibromopyrrole-2,5 - dione ( 2a , b ) . Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide 2a , b with 3 - thienylboronic acid gave 3,4 - bis(3 - thienyl)pyrrole-2,5 - dione ( 3a , b ) . The large sulfur - containing polycyclic aromatic imides , dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 4a , b ) , were synthesized through iron(III ) chloride - mediated oxidative cyclization , which is a general strategy for ring closure . 42 Bromination of 4a , b with Br 2 gave rise to the monomers 5a , b. Stille coupling reaction of 5a with tributyl(thiophen-2 - yl)stannane afforded 2,7 - bis(2 - thienyl)-dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 6a ) , which was brominated with NBS to afford monomer 7a . Copolymers P1 - P4 were synthesized through Stille coupling reaction of the dibromide monomers 5a , b or 7a with benzodithiophene-2,6 - ditin or 2,2 0 -bithiazole-5,5 0 -ditin , while P5 was synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide monomer 5b with benzothiadiazole-4,7 - diboronic ester . Homopolymer P6 was synthesized by palladium - catalyzed homocoupling of the dibromide 5b in the presence of hexabutylditin . P1 with three solubilizing n - dodecyl groups has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , THF , and toluene ."},
