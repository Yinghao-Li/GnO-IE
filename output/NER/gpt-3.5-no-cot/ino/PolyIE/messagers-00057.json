The compositions of different terpolymers were also measured by elemental analysis and both values show good agreement . Thermal Properties . The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure S2 . The TGA revealed that the decomposition temperatures ( T d ) of P1 - P7 ( 5 % weight loss ) are 405 , 407 , 413 , 417 , 433 , 433 , and 444 ° C , respectively . Thus , the thermal stability of the polymers improved as the amount of TPD increased . All of the polymers exhibited excellent thermal stability , which is important for their applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices . 35,36 Optical Properties . The optical properties of all the polymers in dilute chloroform solutions and thin films are shown in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 2 . All the random terpolymers exhibited multiple absorption bands ranging from 300 to 900 nm , a common feature of polymers based on donor and acceptor units . 37 In addition , all polymers showed broader absorption in thin films compared to in solution due to stronger interchain aggregation . 28 The optical band gaps of P1 - P7 were estimated to be 1.38 , 1.38 , 1.40 , 1.42 , 1.49 , 1.55 , and 1.85 eV , respectively , based on the onset of the light absorption . The absorption onset of P7 was blue - shifted compared to P1 , which was due to the weaker electronwithdrawing character of TPD compared to DPP . Upon comparison of the absorption onset of P2 - P6 , a similar trend was observed with a gradual blue - shift from P2 to P6 with higher TPD content . In addition , the increased amount of TPD caused the appearance of a new absorption band around 500- 600 nm , which can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) band from BDTT to TPD . On the other hand , the absorption band around 700 - 800 nm , the ICT band from BDTT to DPP , gradually decreased as the content of TPD increased . By regulating the composition of the electrondeficient units , broad absorptions of the random copolymers , P2 - P6 were observed from 400 to 900 nm compared to the parent polymers , P1 and P7 , indicating that incorporating two different electron - deficient units into polymer backbone is an effective method to broaden the absorption band and control the optical band gap . Electrochemical Properties . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements ( Figure 3 ) . All CV measurements were recorded in a solution of 0.1 M Bu 4 NPF 6 in nitrogen - saturated anhydrous acetonitrile at a scanning rate of 50 mV / s. The results of the electrochemical measurements are listed in Table 2 ."},
