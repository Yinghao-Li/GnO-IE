I ds = ( W / 2L ) × μ × C i ( V gs - V th ) The OFET device using as - cast PCDTBT films without thermal annealing exhibits a hole mobility of 2.2 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 / V ° s with an on / off current ratio ( I on / I off ) of 4.44 × 10 ^ 3 .

To gain a better understanding of the influence of the thermal annealing , the crystallinity and molecular organization of PCDTBT and PCDSeBT thin films were investigated by Xray diffraction ( XRD ) , both before and after annealing at 150 ° C .

In the case of PCDSeBT , the as - cast thin films show very weak diffractions ( Figure 3b ) .

On the basis of these XRD results , we can conclude that the oriented microstructure of the as - cast PCDSeBT thin films is kinetically limited but the polymer chains reorganize to ordered lamellar packing structures upon annealing .
