    {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"Material Name\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Figure 5 shows the transfer curves of the devices fabricated using the polymers as the active layer . The field - effect mobility was calculated in the saturation regime using the following equation : I ds = ( W / 2 , where I ds is the drain - source current in the saturated region , W and L are the channel width and length , respectively , μ is the field - effect mobility , C i is the capacitance per unit area of the insulating layer , and V gs and V th are the gate and threshold voltages , respectively . 28,29 Interestingly , the fieldeffect mobility increased with an increase in the number of perylene units in the corresponding parent polymers . The fieldeffect mobility for PFDTBT , PFDTBT-5Per , PFDTBT-10Per , and PFDTBT-20Per was determined to be 1.0 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.2 × 10 ^ -4 , 5.3 × 10 ^ -4 , and 1.2 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively . Similarly , the measured field - effect mobility of PFD2TBT , PFD2TBT-5Per , and PFD2TBT-10Per was 2.7 × 10 ^ -6 , 1.1 × 10 ^ -5 , and 2.1 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively . This result suggests that the introduction of the flat perylene structure to PFDTBT and PFD2TBT plays an important role in increasing the carrier mobility , possibly due to the enhanced interchain π - π interaction . The characteristics of the TFTs using the polymers as the active layers are summarized in Table 3 . 2L)μC i ( V gs - V th ) 3.6 . Photovoltaic Properties . Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using PFDTBT , PFD2TBT and the ter - polymers as p - type electron donors and by using [ 6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as an n - type acceptor . Two different types of photovoltaic devices were fabricated and characterized , with the device structures of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al and ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al shown in Figure 6 . The solutionprocessable titanium suboxide ( TiO x ) layer was employed as an optical spacer 30,31 and as a hole blocker 27 between the bulk heterojunction(BHJ ) layer and the top metal electrode . Figure 7 shows the current - voltage ( J - V ) characteristics of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices . It can be observed that the open circuit voltages of cells fabricated using PFDTBT and its ter - polymers range from 0.70 to 0.77 V. The device fabricated using PFDTBT showed higher open circuit voltages than those of perylene - containing copolymers . This coincides with the relative HOMO energy levels of the polymers . As the perylene content in the copolymers increased , the amount of DTBT contents decreased , and so the HOMO of the polymers moved to higher energy levels . PFDTBT has the deepest HOMO energy level , thus it showed the highest open circuit voltage ( 0.77 V ) ."},
