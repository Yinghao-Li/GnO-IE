    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| catalepsy |\n| apomorphine-induced catalepsy |\n\nIn this revised list, I have removed the entity \"stereotypy\" because it does not clearly refer to a disease. Instead, it is a type of behavior that can be observed in certain animals, including humans. I have also added the entity \"apomorphine-induced catalepsy\" to the list, as it refers to a specific medical condition that is relevant to the experiment described in the paragraph.\n\nNote that \"apomorphine-induced catalepsy\" is a more specific form of \"catalepsy\" that is brought on by the administration of apomorphine. It is still a type of catalepsy, but it is distinguished from other forms of the condition by its specific cause. Therefore, I have included it as a separate entity in the list."}
