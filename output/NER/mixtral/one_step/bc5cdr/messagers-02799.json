Myoclonus refers to a brief, involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles. In this context, myoclonus is said to be induced by etomidate, which is an intravenous anesthetic medication. Therefore, \"etomidate-induced myoclonus\" is the disease entity in the paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| etomidate-induced myoclonus |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised request, I am asked to remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease.\" In the original paragraph, there are no other entities mentioned that could be classified as a disease. Therefore, the table remains unchanged, and the only disease entity in the paragraph is still \"etomidate-induced myoclonus.\""}

Fentanyl and midazolam are often used together as a sedative before medical procedures, while etomidate is an anesthetic drug that can cause myoclonus (muscle twitching) as a side effect."},

Therefore, all three should be included in the table as valid chemical entities."}
