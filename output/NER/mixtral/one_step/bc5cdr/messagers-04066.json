    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| oral verapamil |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only chemical entity mentioned is \"oral verapamil\". Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker drug used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders. In this study, it was given orally to the patients. Therefore, the precise mention of the chemical entity in the text is \"oral verapamil\"."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| oral verapamil |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised request, I understand that I need to remove any entities that do not clearly refer to \"Chemical.\" In the original paragraph, there were no ambiguous entities, and only one chemical was mentioned: \"oral verapamil.\" Therefore, the valid chemical entity remains the same as in the previous answer: \"oral verapamil.\""}
