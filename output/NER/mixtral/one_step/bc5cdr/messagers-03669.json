I assumed that the text is referring to Imipramine as a drug used to treat certain medical conditions, and therefore, it is relevant to include it in the list of entities. However, if Imipramine is not a drug in the context of the given paragraph, then it should not be included in the list of entities."},

The text only mentions the mechanism for a reaction due to increased levels of vasoactive catecholamines caused by interference with their physiologic inactivation by Imipramine. Therefore, there are no valid entities to present in a Markdown table."}

It is believed to interfere with the physiologic inactivation of vasoactive catecholamines, leading to increased levels of these neurotransmitters."},
