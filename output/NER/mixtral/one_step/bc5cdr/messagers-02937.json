Replacement fibrosis refers to a condition where there is an excessive accumulation of fibrous connective tissue, which replaces the normal functional tissue. In this case, the fibrosis is described as \"extensive,\" indicating a widespread presence of the condition."},

In the original paragraph, there were no other entities mentioned, so the only valid entity that clearly refers to a chemical is \"Sirius red\". Therefore, the resulting table contains only one entry for this chemical compound."}
