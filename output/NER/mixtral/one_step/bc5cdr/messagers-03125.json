However, it is important to note that \"Chronic pre-treatment with metformin\" is not a disease but rather a medical intervention, and \"inhibition of TLR4 activities\" refers to a biological process rather than a disease. Nonetheless, I have included them in the table as they were mentioned in the original paragraph in a context that suggests they are being treated as medical conditions."},
