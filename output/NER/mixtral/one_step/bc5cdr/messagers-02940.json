It is often used as a biomarker for heart damage.\n2. Gadolinium: It is a chemical element with the symbol Gd and atomic number 64. It is used as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to improve the visibility of internal body structures.\n\nTherefore, both \"troponin I\" and \"gadolinium\" are chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
