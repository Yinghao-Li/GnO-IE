Therefore, I have identified \"only BCNU-treated animals\" as a disease entity, as it refers to the group of rats that were treated with Carmustine and exhibited less favorable histological features compared to the group treated with both ZnSO4 and BCNU."},

The other terms, such as \"hippocampus of rats\" and \"ZnSO (4) + BCNU,\" do not clearly refer to a disease."}
