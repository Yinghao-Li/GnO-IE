The entities are:\n\n1. DMPX: This is an abbreviation for 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine, which is a specific antagonist of the A2A subtype of adenosine receptors.\n2. caffeine: This is a natural stimulant most commonly found in tea, coffee, and cacao plants. It works by blocking the action of adenosine, a neurotransmitter that relaxes the brain and makes people feel tired.\n3. amphetamine: This is a potent central nervous system stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and occasionally, depression. It works by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain."},
