However, based on the context and the fact that it's contrasted with \"WT\" (which could stand for \"wild type\" and often refers to a healthy control group), I'm assuming that \"ILK\" is a disease or a genetic mutation causing a disease condition in the animals. Therefore, I have listed \"ILK\" as a disease entity in the table."},

The other terms, such as \"proliferating cell nuclear antigen,\" \"liver,\" and \"animals\" are not diseases.
