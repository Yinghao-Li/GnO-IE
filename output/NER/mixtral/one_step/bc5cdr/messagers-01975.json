    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Retinal function (this is a condition of the eye, but I'm assuming you're asking for diseases mentioned in the text) |\n\nThe text mentions that some patients have abnormal responses in their retinal function, but it does not explicitly mention any specific diseases. I've included \"retinal function\" as a condition for completeness, but please note that it is not a disease. The text also mentions \"VGB users,\" which refers to people who have taken vigabatrin, a medication used to treat epilepsy. However, VGB itself is not a disease. Therefore, there are no clear disease entities mentioned in the text."},
