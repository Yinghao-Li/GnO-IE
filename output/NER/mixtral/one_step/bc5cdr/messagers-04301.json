The convulsions themselves can be considered diseases or medical conditions, and they were induced by different agents, including pentylenetetrazole, bemegride, N - methyl - D - aspartate, picrotoxin, and electroshock. However, since the prompt asks for \"Disease\" entities specifically, I have removed the inducing agents from the table."}
