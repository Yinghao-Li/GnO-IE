    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia |\n| extremely high increase in serum PRL levels |\n\nThe two disease entities identified in the paragraph are \"haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia\" and \"extremely high increase in serum PRL levels\". The first one is a condition characterized by high levels of prolactin in the blood caused by the use of haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication. The second entity refers to an abnormally high increase in the levels of prolactin (PRL) in the blood, which can be caused by various factors, including the implantation of MMQ cells under the kidney capsule."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia |\n\nThe only clear disease entity identified in the paragraph is \"haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia\", which refers to a condition characterized by high levels of prolactin in the blood caused by the use of haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication. The other entity, \"extremely high increase in serum PRL levels\", is a description of a symptom or a biochemical change, rather than a specific disease. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a disease entity."}
