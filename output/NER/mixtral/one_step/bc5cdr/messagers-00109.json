Heparin is a naturally occurring anticoagulant that is used as a medication to prevent blood clots. Therefore, the table above contains one row with the chemical name \"heparin\"."},

In the original paragraph, there were no other entities mentioned besides \"heparin\", so no removal of entities is necessary. Therefore, the table above contains one row with the chemical name \"heparin\"."}
