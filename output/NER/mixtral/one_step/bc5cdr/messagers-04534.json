    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| E - I animals (couldn't determine the exact disease, but mentioned as a group) |\n\nThe paragraph mentions three groups of animals (E - I, S - I, and EC) and compares the serum CPK activity of these groups after isoproterenol injection. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific diseases. The group \"E - I animals\" is compared to the other groups, but the exact meaning of \"E - I\" is not clear from the context. Therefore, I can only list \"E - I animals\" as a potential disease/condition entity, but I cannot provide a precise identification."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| E - I animals (couldn't determine the exact disease, but mentioned as a group) |\n\nAfter reviewing the paragraph again, I still cannot find any clear references to specific diseases other than the \"E - I animals\" group. I apologize for any confusion, but I can only list \"E - I animals\" as a potential disease/condition entity, but I cannot provide a precise identification due to the lack of context."}
