While these terms typically refer to racial or ethnic groups, they are not diseases. However, for the purpose of this exercise, I've assumed that you're asking for the entities that are being \"treated\" as diseases in the context of this paragraph. In this case, the terms \"Black\", \"Caucasian\", and \"Asian\" are being used as if they were diseases or medical conditions, so I have listed them as the \"Disease\" entities in the table above."},
