However, it's important to note that the paragraph does not explicitly confirm that Ebola is the disease in question. Therefore, this identification should be considered tentative and may require further confirmation from additional context."},

The other words in the paragraph do not clearly refer to a disease. Therefore, I have presented \"Ebola\" as the only valid disease entity in the table."}
