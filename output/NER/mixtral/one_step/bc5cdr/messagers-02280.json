Neurologic toxicities: It is a disease condition where the nervous system is affected by toxins.\n2. IT - methotrexate: Methotrexate is a medication used to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. When administered intrathecally (IT), it can cause neurologic toxicities.\n3. IT - cytosine arabinoside: Cytosine arabinoside is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer. When administered intrathecally (IT), it can cause neurologic toxicities.\n4. IT - TSPA: TSPA (Triethylene tetramine hexaacetate) is a chelating agent used to treat lead poisoning. When administered intrathecally (IT), it can cause neurologic toxicities."},
