The term \"toxicity\" is a side effect that can be caused by certain chemicals, but it is not a chemical itself. Similarly, \"drug-drug interaction\" refers to the interaction between two or more chemicals (drugs), but it is not a chemical entity. Therefore, these terms are not included in the table. The entities \"simvastatin\" and \"antiviral drugs\" are mentioned as being discontinued due to the suspicion of toxicity from a drug-drug interaction."}
