However, upon closer examination, \"myocardial disease\" is actually a type of heart disease, and it is not a distinct disease entity from \"coronary artery disease\". Therefore, I have removed \"myocardial disease\" from the list of entities, and only \"coronary artery disease\" remains as a valid disease entity."}
