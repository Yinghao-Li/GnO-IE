The phrase \"doxorubicin-induced\" specifies the cause of the cardiotoxicity, which is the administration of the drug doxorubicin. Therefore, \"doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity\" is a disease entity.\n\nThe term \"monoHER\" does not clearly refer to a disease entity. It is mentioned in the context of the time interval between its administration and doxorubicin administration, but there is no indication that monoHER is a disease. Therefore, it is not included in the table."}
