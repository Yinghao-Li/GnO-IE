Antineoplastic agents are drugs used in chemotherapy to inhibit or prevent the proliferation of cells, especially malignant cells. Therefore, it is related to the treatment of diseases such as cancer."},

However, the term \"cancer\" is a disease that is indirectly mentioned in the paragraph. The drug Ifosfamide (IFO) is an alkylating nitrogen mustard that is used as an antineoplasmic agent, which means it is used to treat cancer. Therefore, the valid entity that clearly refers to \"Disease\" is \"cancer\"."}
