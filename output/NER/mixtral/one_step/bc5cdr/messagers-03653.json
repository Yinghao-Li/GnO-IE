The term \"bone marrow toxicity\" is a medical condition that can be caused by certain chemicals, but in this context, it is not a chemical entity itself. The term \"published\" is an adjective describing the report, not a chemical entity. Therefore, only \"carbamazepine\" is included in the table."}
