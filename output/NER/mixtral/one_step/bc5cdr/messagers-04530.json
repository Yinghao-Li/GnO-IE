However, in this paragraph, it is used as a part of an exercise regimen for the experimental groups. Nonetheless, it is still considered a disease entity since it is a medication used to treat certain medical conditions."},

They are related to the experimental procedure and not medical conditions. Therefore, the only valid disease entity is \"isoproterenol,\" which is presented in the table above."}
