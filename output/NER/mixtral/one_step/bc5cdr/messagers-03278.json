It is a condition in which damaged skeletal muscle tissue breaks down rapidly, releasing muscle fiber contents (myoglobin) into the bloodstream. This can lead to serious complications such as renal failure. In this case, the patient's raised cardiac biomarkers were linked to rhabdomyolysis, indicating that the patient may have had muscle damage without any obvious cardiac issues."},

Therefore, \"raised cardiac biomarkers\" is not included in the table. Similarly, \"cardiac issues\" is not a specific disease entity, but rather a general term that can refer to any condition affecting the heart. Therefore, \"cardiac issues\" is also not included in the table."}
