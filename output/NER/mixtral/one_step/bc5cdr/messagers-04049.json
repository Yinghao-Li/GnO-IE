However, \"I - 131\" and \"HA\" together form a single compound \"I - 131 HA\". Therefore, the table above contains only one entry, \"I - 131 HA\".\n\nThe compound \"I - 131 HA\" is a radioactive iodine isotope, Iodine-131, combined with a non-radioactive organic compound, p-hydroxyaniline (HA). The combination of I-131 and HA is often used in medical imaging and therapy, particularly in the treatment of thyroid disorders."},

The abbreviation \"HA\" refers to p-hydroxyaniline, which is an organic compound and not a chemical in the context of the paragraph.
