Therefore, they do not meet the criteria for being considered a disease entity."}

A metabolic disturbance is a disruption in the body's metabolic processes, while neurotransmitter dysfunction refers to problems with the chemical messengers in the brain."},

Therefore, it is not included in the table.\n\nOn the other hand, \"metabolic disturbance\" is a general term that can refer to a disruption in various metabolic processes, some of which may involve chemical reactions. However, without further context, it is not possible to determine whether the metabolic disturbance in this paragraph specifically refers to a chemical process. Nonetheless, I have included it in the table as it is a term commonly used in the context of chemistry and biochemistry."}
