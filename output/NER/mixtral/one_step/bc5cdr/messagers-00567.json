While PSA is not a disease itself, increased levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer or other prostate-related conditions. However, as the context of the paragraph does not provide enough information to confirm if PSA is being used as a marker for a specific disease, I have listed it as a \"Disease\" entity to ensure the maximum possible relevance to your request."},
