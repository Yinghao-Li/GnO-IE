However, there is a mention of \"hepatic concentration of triglyceride.\" Hepatic refers to the liver, and triglyceride is a type of fat found in the blood. High levels of triglycerides can be a sign of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, or genetic disorders. Therefore, I have identified \"hepatic concentration of triglyceride\" as a disease entity."},

High levels of triglycerides can be a sign of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, or genetic disorders. Therefore, I have identified \"baseline (control) hepatic concentration of triglyceride\" as a disease entity."}
