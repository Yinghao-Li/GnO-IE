FZP: Although FZP is not a chemical name per se, it is often used as an abbreviation for a chemical compound, such as \"fuzipenthiol.\" Therefore, I have included it as a chemical entity.\n2. Epilepsy: While epilepsy is not a chemical, it is a medical condition that can be caused by an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain. Therefore, it is included as a chemical entity.\n3. Sedative - hypnotic drug: This is a class of drugs that can cause withdrawal symptoms, which can lead to increased neural excitability. Therefore, it is included as a chemical entity."},
