The term \"cocaine naive participants\" refers to individuals who have not used cocaine before. \"Occasional cocaine\" and \"regular recreational cocaine users\" refer to individuals who use cocaine occasionally and regularly for recreational purposes, respectively. Therefore, \"cocaine\" is the disease entity in this paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| cocaine |\n\nAfter re-evaluating the paragraph, I realized that the only term that clearly refers to a disease is \"cocaine.\" The other terms, \"cocaine naive participants,\" \"occasional cocaine,\" and \"regular recreational cocaine users,\" are descriptions of the participants' level of cocaine use, not the disease itself. Therefore, the valid disease entity in this paragraph is \"cocaine.\""}
