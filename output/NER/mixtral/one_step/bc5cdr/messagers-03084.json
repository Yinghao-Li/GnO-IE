Anthracyclines are a class of chemotherapy drugs known to cause cardiotoxicity, which is damage to the heart muscle. This damage can lead to various heart conditions, so it is considered a disease state. Therefore, I have identified \"anthracycline cardiotoxicity\" as the disease entity in the paragraph."},
