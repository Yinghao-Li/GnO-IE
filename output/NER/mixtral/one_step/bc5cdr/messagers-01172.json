The left ventricular ejection fraction is a measure used to assess the heart's pumping function, and a low ejection fraction can indicate heart failure or other heart conditions. The atrial dimension (LAD) refers to the size of the left atrium, which can be a sign of various heart diseases, such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure."},

The other term, \"atrial dimension (LAD)\", refers to a measurement of the size of the left atrium, which is not a disease itself but can be a sign of various heart diseases. Therefore, I have removed it from the list of disease entities.\n\nThe left ventricular ejection fraction is a measure used to assess the heart's pumping function, and a low ejection fraction can indicate heart failure or other heart conditions."}
