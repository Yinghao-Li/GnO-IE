Propranolol is a medication used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, angina, and other heart disorders. It is a beta blocker that works by blocking the action of certain natural substances in the body, such as epinephrine, on the heart and blood vessels. Therefore, \"propranolol\" is the only valid chemical entity in the paragraph."},

The other terms, such as \"hemodynamic measurements,\" \"total peripheral resistance,\" \"cardiac output,\" and \"therapy\" are not chemical entities. Therefore, the valid chemical entity in the paragraph is \"propranolol,\" which is a medication used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, angina, and other heart disorders.
