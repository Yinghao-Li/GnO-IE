It is often associated with various metabolic disorders, including fatty liver disease and hyperlipidemia. In the given paragraph, PPARalpha - / - is mentioned as a disease condition in mice, which was treated with amiodarone and resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight loss."},

Wild-type mice are not a disease condition, but rather a control group used for comparison. Therefore, the valid entity that refers to a disease is PPARalpha - / -."}
