Thalidomide is a medication that has been used to treat various conditions, including leprosy and certain types of cancer. However, it is also known for its tragic history of causing severe birth defects when taken during pregnancy. Therefore, Thalidomide can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n\nThe other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"angiogenic agents,\" \"bFGF,\" \"VEGF,\" and \"IL-6,\" are not diseases but rather proteins or growth factors involved in the process of angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels."},
