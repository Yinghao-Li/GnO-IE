    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| tachycardia |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only disease entities mentioned are \"exercise-induced tachycardia\" and \"isoproterenol-induced tachycardia.\" Tachycardia refers to a rapid heart rate, and in this context, it is being induced by exercise and isoproterenol, respectively. Therefore, the valid entities are \"exercise-induced tachycardia\" and \"isoproterenol-induced tachycardia.\" However, since the question asks for the disease entities to be presented precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph, we will list \"tachycardia\" as the disease entity."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| tachycardia |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only disease entity mentioned is \"tachycardia.\" Although it is qualified by \"exercise-induced\" and \"isoproterenol-induced,\" the root word \"tachycardia\" is the actual disease entity. Therefore, the valid entity is \"tachycardia.\""}
