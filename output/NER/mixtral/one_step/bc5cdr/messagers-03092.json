Therefore, the valid chemical entity is presented in the table above.\n\nThe other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"cardiomyocyte\", \"cardiac function\", \"cardiomyocyte apoptosis\", \"Ku70\", and \"Ku80\", do not clearly refer to chemicals. \"Cardiomyocyte\" is a type of muscle cell found in the heart, \"cardiac function\" refers to the heart's ability to pump blood effectively, \"cardiomyocyte apoptosis\" is programmed cell death of cardiomyocytes, and \"Ku70\" and \"Ku80\" are proteins involved in DNA repair. Therefore, these terms are not considered chemical entities."}
