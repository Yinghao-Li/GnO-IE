Thank you for your patience.)"}

They are mentioned as \"cyclophosphamide metabolites\", which refers to the substances produced when the body breaks down the drug cyclophosphamide. However, since the original text separates them with the word \"metabolites\", I have listed them as separate entities in the table."},

Therefore, the only valid chemical entity in the paragraph is \"cyclophosphamide\"."}
