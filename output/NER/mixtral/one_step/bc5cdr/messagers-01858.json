The other entities, \"Hepatocellular\" and \"intestinal ischemia - reperfusion injury\", do not clearly refer to chemical entities. \"Hepatocellular\" refers to a type of cell in the liver, and \"intestinal ischemia - reperfusion injury\" refers to a type of injury that can occur in the intestines. Therefore, I have removed these entities from the table."}
