The other terms, \"dilatation of tubular lumens,\" \"epithelial cell vacuolization,\" and \"atrophy,\" are not diseases themselves but rather pathological changes or conditions that can be associated with various diseases. Therefore, I have removed these terms and included only \"necrosis\" in the table."}
