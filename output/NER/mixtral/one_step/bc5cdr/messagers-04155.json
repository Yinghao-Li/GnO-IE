It is not a single chemical entity, so it was removed.\n3. scoline: It is another name for suxamethonium, a neuromuscular blocking drug. It was removed because it is already included in the list as suxamethonium chloride and suxamethonium bromide.\n4. The final table only includes the two salt preparations of suxamethonium, which are the only clear chemical entities in the original paragraph."}
