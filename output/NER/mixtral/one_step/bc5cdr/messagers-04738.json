Ureteric obstruction: This is a disease condition where there is a blockage in the ureter, one of the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder.\n2. precipitated indinavir crystals: Indinavir is a medication used to treat HIV. When it is not properly dissolved in the urine, it can form crystals that can cause obstruction in the ureter, leading to a disease condition."},
