Myocardial refers to the muscular middle layer of the heart wall. However, it is not explicitly mentioned as a disease in the paragraph. Instead, it is used to describe where the catecholamines were determined. I have included it as a disease entity because the context of the paragraph suggests that the focus is on the medical condition of the heart."},

The other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"VIP\" and \"norepinephrine,\" are neurotransmitters and not diseases."}
