In this context, it is being used as a noun and not as a verb (e.g., \"follow up\" meaning \"to check on the progress of someone or something\"). Therefore, I have included it as a disease entity in this table. However, if \"follow-up\" is not considered a disease entity in your specific context, then you can disregard this entity."},
