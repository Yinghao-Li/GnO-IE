    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| heparin |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only chemical entity mentioned is \"heparin\". Heparin is a naturally occurring anticoagulant that is used clinically for various medical purposes. Therefore, the Markdown table above contains one row with the chemical name \"heparin\" in the \"Chemical\" column."},

In the original paragraph, there were no other entities mentioned besides \"heparin\", so no removal of entities is necessary. Therefore, the Markdown table above contains one row with the chemical name \"heparin\" in the \"Chemical\" column."}
