It seems that there might be a misunderstanding in the question, as there are no actual diseases mentioned in the paragraph."},

However, since the question asks for \"Disease\" entities and there are no other clear disease mentions in the paragraph, I have included \"d, l - sotalol\" in the table. It is important to note that this is not a true disease entity."}
