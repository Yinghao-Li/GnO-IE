Severe anemia: This is a condition where the body has a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells or less than the normal amount of hemoglobin in these cells. In this case, the anemia is said to be due to menorrhagia.\n2. Menorrhagia: This is a medical condition where abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding occurs during menstruation. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the cause of the patient's severe anemia.\n3. Deterioration of renal function: This refers to the decline in the kidneys' ability to filter waste and maintain the body's balance of electrolytes. It is an important consideration in the patient's care, as renal function is critical for overall health."},
