    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| intraoperative dialysis |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only chemical entity mentioned is \"intraoperative dialysis\". Dialysis is a process that uses a membrane to remove impurities or excess substances from a fluid, often in the context of treating kidney failure. Intraoperative dialysis specifically refers to this process being performed during surgery. Therefore, it is the valid chemical entity in this paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| intraoperative dialysis |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised question, I understand that I need to remove any entities that do not clearly refer to \"Chemical.\" In the original paragraph, there were no other entities mentioned besides \"acute kidney injury\" (AKI), which is a medical condition and not a chemical. Therefore, the valid chemical entity remains \"intraoperative dialysis,\" and it is presented in the table as before."}
