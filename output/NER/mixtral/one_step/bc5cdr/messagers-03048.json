QT interval is a measurement of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. Prolongation of the QT interval can be a sign of certain heart conditions or can be caused by some medications, which can lead to serious heart rhythm problems. Therefore, it is a disease entity."},
