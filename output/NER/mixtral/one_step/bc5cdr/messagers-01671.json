The full form of HAART is highly active antiretroviral therapy, which is a type of medication used to treat HIV infection. The term \"generic\" before HAART indicates that it is a version of the drug that is made by a company other than the original developer, and it is sold under a generic name. Therefore, \"generic HAART\" is a chemical entity."}
