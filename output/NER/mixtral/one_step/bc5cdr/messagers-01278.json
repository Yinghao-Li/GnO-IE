In this case, it is unexplained, indicating that the cause is unknown.\n3. \"phytotherapy-associated interstitial nephropathy\" - Phytotherapy refers to the use of plants for medicinal purposes. Interstitial nephropathy is a kidney disease affecting the spaces between the kidney tubules. The paragraph suggests that this condition should be considered in patients who present with unexplained renal failure."},

Therefore, it has been excluded from the list of diseases."}

Anthraquinones are a type of organic compound that contain a nine-carbon skeleton with a benzene ring fused to a quinone ring. They are commonly found in various plants and have been used in traditional medicine for their laxative and therapeutic properties.\n\nThe term \"phytotherapy\" refers to the use of plants or plant extracts for medicinal purposes, but it is not a specific chemical entity. Similarly, \"renal injury\" and \"renal failure\" refer to medical conditions related to the kidneys, but they do not refer to any specific chemical substances.\n\nTherefore, the only valid chemical entity in the paragraph is \"anthraquinone,\" which is presented in the table above."},
