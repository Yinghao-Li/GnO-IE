The paragraph discusses antiretroviral therapy (ART) and CD4+ T-cells, but neither of these are diseases. Antiretroviral therapy is a treatment for HIV, and CD4+ T-cells are a type of white blood cell that are important for the immune system. However, they are not diseases themselves."}

Nonetheless, since the word \"alcohol\" is not used to specifically refer to ethanol, I will only list \"antiretroviral therapy ( ART )\" as a chemical entity."}
