The term \"EEG\" (Electroencephalography) is a medical measurement technique and not a chemical, and \"hippocampal\" is a region of the brain. Therefore, these terms should not be included in the table. The word \"treated\" is not a chemical entity either, so it should not be included in the table. Therefore, the only valid entity that needs to be included in the table is \"pilocarpine\"."}
