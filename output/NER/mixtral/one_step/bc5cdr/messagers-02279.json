It is a condition that affects the nerves, specifically the axons, and can cause weakness, numbness, and pain, often in the lower extremities. The term \"motor predominance\" describes a feature of the neuropathy, but it is not a disease itself. Similarly, \"IT chemotherapy\" refers to a type of treatment, not a disease. The time frame of 1 and 6 months after chemotherapy was administered is also not a disease entity. Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"axonal neuropathy.\""},
