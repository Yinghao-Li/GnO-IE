Calcium antagonist: It is a type of medication that relaxes the heart muscle and is used to treat high blood pressure, angina (chest pain), and certain heart rhythm disorders.\n2. CD - 832: It is a specific type of calcium antagonist, which is being studied for its effects on isoproterenol-induced myocardial ischemia in dogs with partial coronary stenosis.\n3. Isoproterenol: It is a medication used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate) and heart block. It is a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, which means it stimulates both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, leading to an increase in heart rate and force of heart contractions.\n4. Myocardial ischemia: It is a condition in which blood flow to the heart muscle is reduced, leading to chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.\n5. Partial coronary stenosis: It is a narrowing of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. This narrowing can reduce blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to myocardial ischemia."},
