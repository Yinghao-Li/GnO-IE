These entities are mentioned in the context of the study described in the paragraph, and they are related to the effects of exposure to beta-AR agonists on the heart. There are no other entities in the paragraph that clearly refer to a disease."}

It is a type of drug that activates beta-adrenergic receptors, which are responsible for the sympathetic nervous system's regulation of heart function. Therefore, I have presented this term as a valid entity in the Markdown table."},

The term \"sympathetic outflow\" refers to the nervous system's activity, not a specific chemical. Therefore, I have removed this term and presented \"beta - AR agonist\" as a valid entity in the Markdown table."}
