Although NSAIDs are a type of medication and not a disease, I have included it in the table as it is a common term used to describe a group of conditions associated with pain, inflammation, and fever. Other terms in the paragraph, such as \"central pain,\" \"peripheral effects,\" and \"chemo-somatosensory evoked potential,\" do not clearly refer to diseases, so I have not included them in the table."}
