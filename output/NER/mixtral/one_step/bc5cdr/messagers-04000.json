Thrombosis refers to the formation of a blood clot within a blood vessel, which can obstruct the flow of blood. In this case, the thrombosis is located in the atrium of the heart, which is why it is referred to as \"atrial thrombosis.\" Therefore, I have identified \"Atrial thrombosis\" as the disease entity in the paragraph."},
