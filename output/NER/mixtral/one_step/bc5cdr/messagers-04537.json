It is considered a disease or disorder when it becomes abnormally high or low, which can be a sign of various respiratory or neurological conditions."},

Hypercapnic ventilatory response refers to the body's response to an increase in carbon dioxide in the blood, while \"humans\" refers to a species of organisms. Therefore, they are not included in the table."}
