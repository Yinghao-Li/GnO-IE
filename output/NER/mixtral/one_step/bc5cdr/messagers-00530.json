The term \"cocaine action\" is used to refer to the physiological or pathological effects of cocaine, which can be considered a disease or disorder. However, the term \"cocaine action\" is not a well-defined disease entity, and it is used here to refer to the effects of cocaine on locomotor activity in animals."}
