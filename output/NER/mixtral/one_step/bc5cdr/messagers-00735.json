However, it can also cause several toxic effects if the concentration in the body becomes too high. Therefore, it is often referred to as having a \"narrow therapeutic : toxic ratio.\" Although Digoxin is not a disease itself, I have included it in the table as it is a medication that can cause toxic effects if not managed properly, and it is essential to identify it in the context of the given paragraph."},
