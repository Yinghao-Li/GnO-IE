However, \"ADR\" is actually an abbreviation that can stand for \"adverse drug reaction\" or \"adrenodrenergic receptor.\" Since the context of this paragraph is about mice being treated with a drug, it is likely that \"ADR\" in this case refers to \"adverse drug reaction.\" Nonetheless, since the prompt asks for the identification of \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, I have included \"ADR\" in the table."},
