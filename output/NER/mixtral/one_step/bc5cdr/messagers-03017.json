Heparin is an anticoagulant medication that is used to prevent blood clots. It is mentioned in the context of the patient developing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is a condition in which the drug heparin causes a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, leading to an increased risk of bleeding and blood clot formation."},
