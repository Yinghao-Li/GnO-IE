AKI is a specific medical condition characterized by the sudden loss of kidney function, while ICU patients are individuals who are critically ill and require intensive care. Both of these entities are relevant to the topic of the paragraph, which discusses the occurrence of AKI in hospitalized patients, particularly those in the ICU."},

The other entity, \"Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients\", does not clearly refer to a disease, but rather to a group of patients who require intensive care. Therefore, I have removed this entity from the table."}
