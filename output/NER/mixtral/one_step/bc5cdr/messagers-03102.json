Voltage - dependent Na ( + ) channels: This is a chemical entity as it refers to a type of ion channel that is sensitive to changes in membrane potential and allows the flow of sodium ions.\n2. Aconitine: This is a chemical entity as it is a toxic diterpene alkaloid found in aconite plants.\n\nTherefore, both \"Voltage - dependent Na ( + ) channels\" and \"Aconitine\" are chemical entities in the given paragraph."},

Voltage - dependent Na ( + ) channels: This is not a chemical entity in itself, but rather a type of ion channel that is composed of proteins. Therefore, it is not included in the table.\n2. Aconitine: This is a chemical entity as it is a toxic diterpene alkaloid found in aconite plants.\n\nTherefore, only \"Aconitine\" is a chemical entity in the given paragraph."}
