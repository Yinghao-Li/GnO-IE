There are two disease mentions in the text: \"levodopa\" and \"ocular dyskinesias.\"\n3. However, \"levodopa\" itself is not a disease; it is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease.\n4. The actual disease entity is \"levodopa-induced ocular dyskinesias,\" which is a complication that can occur in patients treated with levodopa for Parkinson's disease.\n5. Therefore, I have included \"levodopa-induced ocular dyskinesias\" as the valid disease entity in the table."},

Therefore, I have included \"severe dopaminergic denervation in the caudate nucleus\" as the valid disease entity in the table."}
