Reactive oxygen species: These are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen. They are often byproducts of normal metabolic processes in the body, but can also be introduced from external sources.\n2. Antioxidant: These are substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells caused by free radicals, unstable molecules that the body produces as a reaction to environmental and other pressures.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, \"reactive oxygen species\" and \"antioxidant\" are the two chemical entities."},
