Lipofuscin is a type of pigment that can accumulate in various tissues and cells, including heart, liver, nerve, and retinal cells. It is often referred to as \"age pigment\" because it tends to accumulate with age. However, excessive accumulation of lipofuscin can be associated with certain diseases or conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nNote that \"body weight loss\" and \"elevated plasma H2O2 and increased FRAP values\" are not considered disease entities in this context. Body weight loss can be a symptom of various medical conditions, but it is not a disease itself. Similarly, elevated plasma H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) and increased FRAP (ferric reducing ability of plasma) values are laboratory test results that can indicate certain physiological or pathological conditions, but they are not diseases."},
