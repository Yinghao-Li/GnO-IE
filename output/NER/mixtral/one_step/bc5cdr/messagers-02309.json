It is considered a chemical entity because it is a well-defined medical condition with a specific set of symptoms and diagnostic criteria.\n\n* Cyclosporine: This is a medication that is used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs. It is an immunosuppressant drug, which means that it works by suppressing the activity of the immune system. Cyclosporine is a chemical entity because it is a specific compound with a well-defined chemical structure and pharmacological properties."},

It is a medical condition that can be caused by various factors, including certain medications like cyclosporine. However, it is not a specific chemical compound or substance, so it does not meet the criteria for a chemical entity."}
