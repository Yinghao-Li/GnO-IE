It is mentioned twice, and both instances are included in the table. The term refers to damage to the nervous system caused by various factors, such as exposure to certain chemicals or drugs. In this case, the text mentions \"increased neurotoxicity\" and \"neurotoxicity incidence,\" which are both related to the adverse effects of a medication called busulfan."},

Similarly, \"higher doses\" and \"adults\" are not disease entities, as they refer to the administration of medication and a demographic group, respectively."}

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| busulfan |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised request, I understand that I need to remove any entities that do not clearly refer to \"Chemical.\" In this case, the original paragraph does not contain any other entities that could be considered chemical entities. Therefore, the valid entity remains as \"busulfan.\""}
