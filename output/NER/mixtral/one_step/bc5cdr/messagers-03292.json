Ala204Asp / p. Asp70Gly - p. Ala539Thr tetrameric enzyme\" is identified as a disease entity because it is described as reduced in concentration, which implies that it is a medical condition or disease."},

The other phrases in the paragraph refer to the concentration, plasma, and electrophoresis gels, which do not clearly refer to a disease."}
