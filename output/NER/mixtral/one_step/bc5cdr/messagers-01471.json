Piperacillin-induced encephalopathy: This is a disease or condition where encephalopathy (any brain disease, disorder, or damage) is caused by the administration of Piperacillin (an antibiotic).\n2. Uremic patients: Uremia is a condition that occurs when your kidneys can't remove waste and excess water from your blood effectively.

In this context, it is used to describe patients with unexplained neurological manifestations."},
