It is sometimes considered a \"chemical\" entity because it is closely related to the biochemistry of the blood and the substances it contains. However, it is not a chemical in the strict sense of the word, and some may consider it to be more of a physiological concept. Nonetheless, I have included it in the table above because it was the only term in the paragraph that had any possible connection to chemistry or biochemistry."},
