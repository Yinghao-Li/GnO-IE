QTc variability: Although not a disease in the traditional sense, QTc is a measurement of the time it takes for the heart's ventricles to repolarize, and prolongation of this interval can be indicative of various heart conditions.\n2. hypokalemia: A condition characterized by low potassium levels in the blood.\n3. altered liver function: While not a specific disease, altered liver function can be a symptom or sign of various liver-related diseases or conditions."},
