It is a dimeric protein that consists of two subunits, S100A and S100B, and is involved in several cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and motility. Therefore, I have identified \"S - 100 protein\" as the chemical entity in the paragraph and presented it in the Markdown table as requested."},
