Isoproterenol is a medication used to treat bradycardia (a condition where the heart beats too slowly) and heart block (a condition where the electrical signal that triggers the heart to beat isn't transmitted properly), but the paragraph does not specify that these conditions are present in the mice. Therefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities to extract from the paragraph."},
