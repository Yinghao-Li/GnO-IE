The other terms, such as \"pre-LT illness\" and \"requirement for organ support\" are not specific diseases but rather conditions or states related to the disease."}

The other terms such as \"ALF\" (acute liver failure), \"LT\" (liver transplant), \"APACHE II\" (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) do not refer to chemicals, but rather medical procedures or scoring systems. Therefore, they are not included in the table."}
