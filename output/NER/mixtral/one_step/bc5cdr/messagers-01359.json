Severe malaria is a severe form of the infectious disease malaria, which can lead to life-threatening complications if left untreated."},

The other entity, \"Quinine-induced arrhythmia,\" is not a disease itself but rather a condition caused by the medication quinine. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a disease entity."}
