Cardiotoxicity refers to the toxic effect of a substance (in this case, the drug 5-FU) on the heart. Therefore, the table above contains the precise mention of the disease entity in the original paragraph."},

S - 1: This is a chemical entity, which is a type of anti-cancer drug called a fluoropyrimidine. It is used in the treatment of various cancers, including colon, rectal, and breast cancer.\n2. 5 - FU: This is another chemical entity, which is a chemotherapeutic drug called 5-fluorouracil. It is used to treat a variety of cancers, including colon, esophageal, stomach, and skin cancers.\n\nNote: I assumed that \"5 - FU\" is short for \"5-fluorouracil\" as it is a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug."},
