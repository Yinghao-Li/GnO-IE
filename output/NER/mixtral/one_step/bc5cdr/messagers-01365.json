It is a type of heart disease.\n* Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a type of heart rhythm disorder, which is a type of disease.\n* Sinoatrial block is a type of heart block, which is a type of heart disease.\n\nNote: ECG recording, trigemini, and positive U wave are not diseases. ECG is a test to record the electrical activity of the heart, trigemini is a type of headache, and positive U wave is an abnormal finding on ECG, but none of them are considered diseases."},

However, it is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph that the patient had sinoatrial block, only that the ECG recording showed a \"sinoatrial block\" pattern.\n* Trigemini and positive U wave are not diseases, but rather abnormal findings on ECG or types of headaches."}
