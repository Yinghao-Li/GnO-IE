In this paragraph, \"HCV\" is referred to as a \"disease\" because it is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver and can lead to serious health complications if left untreated. The term \"Anti-HCV\" refers to antibodies produced by the immune system in response to a Hepatitis C infection. In this case, the statement \"Anti-HCV was negative in all of them\" implies that none of the individuals tested had antibodies against HCV, indicating that they had not been infected with the virus."},
