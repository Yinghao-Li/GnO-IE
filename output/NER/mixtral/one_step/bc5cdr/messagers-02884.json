It is characterized by a twisting of the points on the electrocardiogram (ECG) trace, hence the name \"torsade de pointes\" which means \"twisting of the spindle\" in French.\n\n\"QT intervals\" refer to a specific measurement on an ECG that reflects the time it takes for the heart's electrical system to recharge after each heartbeat. Prolonged QT intervals can be a sign of certain heart conditions or can be caused by certain medications."},
