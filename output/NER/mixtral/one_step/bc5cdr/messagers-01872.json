It is a mental health condition that affects moods, which can swing from one extreme to another. In this case, the disorder is mentioned in the context of being potentially related to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a malfunction of the mitochondria, the energy-producing parts of cells. However, mitochondrial dysfunction is not considered a disease itself, but rather a condition or a factor that may contribute to various diseases."},
