EADs are a type of abnormal heart rhythm that can potentially lead to more serious heart rhythm disorders. QT prolongation refers to a condition where the QT interval, a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle, is longer than normal. This can increase the risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death."},
