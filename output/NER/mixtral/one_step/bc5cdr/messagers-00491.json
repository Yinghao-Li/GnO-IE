The other term, \"nicergoline (Sermion)\", refers to a medication used to treat various conditions, including cognitive impairment and peripheral vascular disease. While medications can cause diseases or medical conditions, they are not diseases themselves. Therefore, \"nicergoline (Sermion)\" is not included in the table as it does not clearly refer to a disease."}
