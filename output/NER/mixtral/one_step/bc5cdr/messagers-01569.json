It is a target of the drug lithium.\n* Valproate: It is the salt of valproic acid, a simple branched-chain fatty acid. It is used as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer.\n* MIP synthase: Mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase is an enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of mevalonate 5-diphosphate to isopentenyl diphosphate, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of sterols, terpenes, and steroids. It is a target of the drug valproate."},
