Therefore, \"chronic epileptic\" can be considered a disease entity."},

The term \"growth-associated protein 43\" refers to a protein that is involved in the growth and development of neurons, and \"cycloheximide\" is a drug used to inhibit protein synthesis. Therefore, these terms do not refer to diseases."}
