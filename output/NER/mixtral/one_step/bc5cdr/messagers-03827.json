Therefore, I have only included \"cardiovascular system\" as the valid disease entity."}

It is a chemical element with the symbol Ba and atomic number 56. In this context, it is mentioned in relation to potential adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system due to long-term ingestion."},

The term \"mammalian cardiovascular system\" refers to an organ system, not a chemical. Therefore, the valid and precise chemical entity in the original paragraph is \"barium\", which I have presented in the Markdown table."}
