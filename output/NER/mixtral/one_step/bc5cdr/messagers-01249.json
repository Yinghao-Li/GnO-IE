Myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3 are both enzymes that can be targeted by antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), which are associated with certain types of vasculitis, a group of diseases characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels. Therefore, I have listed them as a single entity in the table above."},

These entities are related to diseases as they are both associated with certain types of vasculitis, which is a group of diseases characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels."}

Proteinase-3: It is a serine protease enzyme that is primarily found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils.\n3. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody: Although it is a type of antibody, which is a protein, it is still considered a chemical as it is a specific substance with a unique molecular structure."}
