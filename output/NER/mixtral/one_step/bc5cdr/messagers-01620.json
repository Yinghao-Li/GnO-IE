    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| CYP |\n| cystitis |\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. p75 and NTR are protein names and do not refer to chemicals.\n2. - IR is a contraction of \"immunoreactive\" which is a term used to describe a biological response to a stimulus and not a chemical.\n3. CYP is an abbreviation for cytochrome P450, a family of enzymes involved in drug metabolism and thus is a chemical.\n4. Cystitis is an inflammation of the bladder and can be caused by a chemical or a bacterial infection, but in this context, it is being induced by CYP, so it is considered a chemical."}
