Chronic administration of estrogen: Although \"chronic administration\" and \"estrogen\" separately do not meet the criteria for a disease, the combination of these two terms is considered a disease in the context of the paragraph because it refers to the adverse effect of estrogen administration over time.\n2. Growth of large, hemorrhagic pituitary tumors: This is a clear disease entity in the paragraph, referring to the abnormal growth and bleeding of pituitary tumors in the Fischer 344 rat."},
