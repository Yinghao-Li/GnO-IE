A search for DEP in medical literature shows that it could refer to Disruptive Emotional Disorder, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact disease.\n* manic is a term used to describe a manic episode, which is a symptom of bipolar disorder, a well-known medical condition."},

However, it is not clear what \"DEP\" stands for in this context. It could be an abbreviation for a specific chemical compound, but without further information, it is not possible to determine its exact identity. Therefore, I can only provide the term \"DEP\" as a potential chemical entity in the form of a Markdown table."},

While it is not clear what \"DEP\" stands for in this context, it is mentioned as a chemical that participants in the study were taking. Therefore, I have included it as a potential chemical entity in the form of a Markdown table. The other terms in the paragraph, such as \"pupillometric changes,\" \"total power of pupillary oscillation,\" and \"manic\" do not refer to chemical entities and have not been included in the table."}
