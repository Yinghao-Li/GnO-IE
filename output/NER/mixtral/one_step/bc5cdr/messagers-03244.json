Instead, it is a medical procedure that may have side effects, including the two diseases mentioned in the paragraph: \"fasciculation\" and \"myalgia\". These are the only disease entities present in the paragraph."}

These are the only two entities that can be classified as chemicals, as they are both drugs used in medical procedures. The term \"fasciculation\" refers to a muscle twitch or spasm, and \"myalgia\" refers to muscle pain, so they do not refer to chemicals."}
