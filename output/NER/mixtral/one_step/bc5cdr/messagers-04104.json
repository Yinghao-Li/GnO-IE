A tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic muscle contraction and relaxation that causes a shaking movement. The term \"tremor amplitudes\" refers to the severity or size of the tremors, not a separate disease. The other terms mentioned in the paragraph are related to medical substances used in infusions, not diseases."},
