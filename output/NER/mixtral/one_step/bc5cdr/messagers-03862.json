While \"APAP deacetylation\" is not a disease, I've included it as a \"Disease\" entity because the context of the paragraph suggests that it's being discussed in the context of a negative health effect. If you'd prefer not to include \"APAP deacetylation\" as a \"Disease\" entity, then there are no disease entities in the paragraph."},
