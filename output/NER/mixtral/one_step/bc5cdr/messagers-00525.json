Adenosine is a naturally occurring purine nucleoside that plays a role in a number of biological processes, including sleep regulation, wakefulness, and blood flow.\n3. Amphetamine: A potent central nervous system stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and occasionally depression."},
