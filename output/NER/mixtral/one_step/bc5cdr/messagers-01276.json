This term refers to a medical condition characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix components in the renal interstitium, leading to scarring and loss of functional tissue. Therefore, \"hypocellular interstitial fibrosis\" is identified as the disease entity in this paragraph."},

While \"fibrosis\" involves the formation of excess fibrous tissue, it is not a chemical entity in the traditional sense, but rather a pathological process. However, since the prompt asks for all \"chemical\" entities, I have included it in the response."},
