TaqIB: This is a genetic marker or a specific sequence of nucleotides used in genetic studies.\n3. rs6275: This is a reference SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) ID, which refers to a specific location in the genome where a single nucleotide may vary among individuals.\n4. TaqIA: This is another genetic marker or a specific sequence of nucleotides used in genetic studies.\n\nThese entities are chemical in nature as they refer to specific genetic variations, markers, or sequences of nucleotides."},

The other entities, TaqIB, rs6275, and TaqIA, are genetic markers or specific sequences of nucleotides, but they do not directly refer to a chemical substance. Therefore, I have only included \"- 141Cins > del\" in the table as a valid chemical entity."}
