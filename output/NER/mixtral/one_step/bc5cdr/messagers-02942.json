It is a medical imaging technique that uses a contrast agent, but the term \"contrast enhancement\" itself does not refer to a specific chemical. Therefore, I have removed it from the list. The only remaining chemical entity is \"cTnI (Troponin I)\", which is a biomarker used to detect heart damage."}
