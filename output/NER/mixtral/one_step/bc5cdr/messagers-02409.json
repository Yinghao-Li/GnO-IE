LDH, CPK, ALT, and AST are enzymes that can be measured in the blood and are often elevated in certain diseases or health conditions. MDA is a marker of oxidative stress and can be associated with various diseases. However, it's important to note that these markers alone do not necessarily indicate the presence of a specific disease, and their interpretation should be done in the context of a complete clinical evaluation."}
