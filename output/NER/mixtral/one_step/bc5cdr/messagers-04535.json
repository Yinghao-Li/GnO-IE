The sentence is comparing the effects of two groups treated with isoproterenol, and hence it is the only chemical entity that needs to be identified."},

The other terms such as \"severity\", \"lesions\", \"changes\", \"heart weight\", and \"body weight ratios\" are not chemical entities. Therefore, the valid chemical entity is \"isoproterenol\", which is presented in the table as a single entry."}
