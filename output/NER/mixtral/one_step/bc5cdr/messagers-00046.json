Rheumatoid arthritis: A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting many joints, including those in the hands and feet. It typically causes swelling, pain, and stiffness, and can lead to loss of function and joint deformity.\n2. Acute cytolytic hepatitis: A form of hepatitis (liver inflammation) characterized by the rapid destruction of liver cells (hepatocytes), leading to increased levels of liver enzymes in the blood. In this case, it was caused by the medication meloxicam."},
