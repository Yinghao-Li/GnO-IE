Additionally, \"previously untreated patients\" implies that these individuals have a disease or condition that is being treated. However, the specific disease or condition is not mentioned in the text. Therefore, the table above includes these two phrases as they are most closely related to the concept of disease in the context of the paragraph."},

The remaining entity, \"objective responses,\" is included in the table above, as it refers to the positive effects of a treatment on a disease or condition."}
