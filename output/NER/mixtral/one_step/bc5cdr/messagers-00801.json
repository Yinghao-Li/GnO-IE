The term \"rosaceiform dermatitis\" is a medical condition and not a chemical, so it is not included in the table. The word \"treatment\" is not a chemical either, so it is also not included in the table. The word \"ointment\" is a pharmaceutical formulation, not a chemical, so it is not included in the table. Therefore, the only valid chemical entity in the paragraph is \"tacrolimus\"."}
