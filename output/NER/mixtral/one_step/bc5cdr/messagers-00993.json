Therefore, they do not meet the criteria for being considered a disease entity."}

In the original paragraph, there were no other entities mentioned that could be classified as chemical entities. Therefore, the Markdown table remains the same as in my previous answer, with one row containing the chemical entity \"warfarin\"."}
