It is a general term used to describe harm or injury to the kidneys. The light microscopic evidence of this damage was seen above a dose of 0.5 mg/kg doxorubicin.\n\nNote:\n\n* \"Albuminuria\" and \"low serum albumin levels\" are not considered disease entities in this context. Albuminuria is a condition in which there is too much albumin (a type of protein) in the urine, which can be a sign of kidney damage. Low serum albumin levels can also be a sign of kidney disease, but in this context, it is a consequence of doxorubicin-induced renal damage."},
