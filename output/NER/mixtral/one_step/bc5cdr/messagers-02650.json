It stands for Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion. It is a condition in which the body makes too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This hormone helps regulate the balance of water in your body. A high level of ADH can cause the body to retain water. This can lead to low sodium levels in the blood, and it can also dilute the sodium in the body. The symptoms of SIADH can include headache, difficulty concentrating, seizures, and shortness of breath."},
