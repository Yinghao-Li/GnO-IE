It is involved in many biological processes, such as energy transfer.\n2. A1 receptors: a type of adenosine receptor that is activated by adenosine and plays a role in various physiological functions.\n3. cocaine: a powerful stimulant drug that is derived from the leaves of the coca plant. It is highly addictive and can have serious health consequences."},

It is mentioned in the context of adenosine receptors, which are proteins that bind to adenosine and mediate its effects.\n2. A1 receptors: These are proteins that bind to adenosine and mediate its effects. While they are activated by the chemical adenosine, they are not themselves chemicals."}
