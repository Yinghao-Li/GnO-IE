The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"headache\", \"facial flushing\", \"palpitations\", \"nausea\", \"anorexia\", and \"dizziness\", are not chemical entities and have been excluded from the table."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| dihydropyridine |\n| calcium channel blockers |\n\nExplanation:\n\nAfter removing entities that do not clearly refer to \"Chemical\", we are left with \"dihydropyridine\" and \"calcium channel blockers\". \"Dihydropyridine\" is a class of organic compounds, and \"calcium channel blockers\" are a type of medication that contains chemical substances. Therefore, both of these entities are chemical in nature. The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"headache\", \"facial flushing\", \"palpitations\", \"edema\", \"nausea\", \"anorexia\", and \"dizziness\", are not chemical entities and have been excluded from the table."}
