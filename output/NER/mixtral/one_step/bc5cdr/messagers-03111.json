In this context, it is referred to as a \"disease\" in the field of bioinformatics or medical research. Therefore, I have included it as a valid entity in the table."},

The other terms, such as \"pro-apoptotic protein expression\" and \"anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 expression,\" are related to the process of apoptosis but do not refer to diseases themselves."}
