After reevaluating the paragraph, I realized that \"Caspase - 3\" is not a chemical but an enzyme. Therefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is:\n\n1. STZ: An abbreviation for Streptozocin, a chemical compound used in laboratory research and sometimes in the treatment of pancreatic cancer."}
