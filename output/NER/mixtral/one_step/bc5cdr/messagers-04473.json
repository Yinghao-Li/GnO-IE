In this context, DES is used to describe the chemical-induced pituitary growth."},

All other terms, such as \"pituitary growth\" and \"hemorrhagic phenotype,\" refer to biological processes or characteristics, not chemicals. Therefore, the valid chemical entity is \"DES,\" which is presented in the table above."}
