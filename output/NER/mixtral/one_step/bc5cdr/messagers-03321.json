Decreased sensation: This refers to a partial or complete loss of feeling or sensation in the body, which can be caused by various medical conditions.\n2. Paresthesia: This is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness of the skin, which can occur without any apparent cause or as a result of nerve damage or injury.\n\nTherefore, these two terms are identified as disease entities and presented in the table above."},

Therefore, it is not included in the table above. The term \"steroid injection\" is not considered a disease entity, as it refers to a medical procedure rather than a disease. Similarly, \"right lateral epicondyle\" is a medical term that refers to a specific anatomical location, and not a disease entity."}
