Diazinon: This is an organophosphate insecticide that can be harmful to humans and animals. It is mentioned specifically in the paragraph as the substance that was tested.\n2. Cholesterol: This is a sterol found in the cell membranes of all body cells and has important functions, such as maintaining membrane fluidity. It is mentioned in the paragraph as one of the substances whose concentration was significantly increased after exposure to diazinon.\n3. Triglyceride: This is a type of fat found in the blood that is produced from the food we eat. It is mentioned in the paragraph as one of the substances whose concentration was significantly increased after exposure to diazinon.\n4. LDL: This stands for low-density lipoprotein, which is a type of cholesterol that can build up in the walls of the arteries and cause heart disease. It is mentioned in the paragraph as one of the substances whose concentration was significantly increased after exposure to diazinon."},

The other entities mentioned (cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL) are substances found in the body, but they are not chemicals in the sense of being synthetic or man-made substances. Therefore, they do not meet the criteria for being considered chemical entities."}
