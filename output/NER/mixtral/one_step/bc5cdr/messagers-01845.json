Aphasia is a disease that affects a person's ability to communicate, often resulting from damage to the language areas of the brain.\n2. \"Weakness of his left limbs\" could be a symptom of various diseases, such as a stroke or multiple sclerosis. However, since the paragraph only mentions the symptom and not the specific disease, I have included it as a disease entity to ensure comprehensive coverage."},
