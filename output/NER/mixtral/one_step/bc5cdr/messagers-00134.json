It is a condition where the kidneys are damaged and cannot function properly, often due to exposure to certain toxins or medications, such as amphotericin B. The lipid nanosphere (NS-718) mentioned in the paragraph is being studied for its potential to attenuate, or reduce, the nephrotoxicity caused by amphotericin B."},
