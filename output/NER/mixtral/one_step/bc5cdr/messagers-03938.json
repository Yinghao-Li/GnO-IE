Since the paragraph you provided did not mention any specific chemicals, I made an assumption based on the context. However, upon re-reading your request, I understand that you would like me to identify chemical entities that are clearly referred to in the paragraph. Since the paragraph does not contain any clear references to specific chemicals, the table above is still empty."}
