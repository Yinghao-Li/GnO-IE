It refers to the recovery period after a surgical operation and can encompass various complications or adverse effects that might arise. However, in this particular paragraph, it is used to describe a patient's evolution under supportive therapy, which suggests a positive outcome rather than an ongoing disease. Therefore, the identification of \"Postoperative\" as a disease entity is somewhat context-dependent."},

However, since the question asks for disease entities, I have included it in the table. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the context does not strongly suggest the presence of a disease."}
