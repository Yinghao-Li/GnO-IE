Hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by an excess of prolactin in the blood, which can lead to various symptoms such as menstrual irregularities, breast milk production, and decreased sexual desire. In this case, the term \"chronic\" is used to describe the persistent nature of the condition."},

The other term, \"dopamine neurons,\" refers to a type of nerve cell that produces and releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter. It does not refer to a disease."}
