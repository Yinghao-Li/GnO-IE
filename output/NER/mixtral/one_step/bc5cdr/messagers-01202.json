The term \"hypertension\" is a medical condition and not a chemical, so it has been removed. Additionally, \"NO\" is a well-known abbreviation for nitric oxide, and it is clear from the context that it refers to the chemical compound and not to any other meaning of the letters \"NO\". Therefore, it is included in the table as \"nitric oxide (NO)\"."}
