Asterixis is a type of abnormal movement that is often associated with various neurological conditions. It is also known as \"flapping tremors\" because of its characteristic appearance, which resembles the flapping of a bird's wings. In this report, asterixis was triggered in four patients who were treated with a combination of different psychotropic drugs, either by adding carbamazepine (CBZ) to their treatment regimen or by increasing its dosage."},
