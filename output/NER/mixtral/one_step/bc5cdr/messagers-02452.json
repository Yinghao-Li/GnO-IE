The other terms mentioned, such as \"duration of levodopa therapy\", \"onset age\", and \"total daily levodopa dose\" are not diseases, but rather factors or variables associated with the disease. Therefore, the only valid disease entity in this paragraph is \"dyskinesia\"."}

The phrase \"total daily levodopa dose\" includes the chemical \"levodopa\", but it also includes the word \"dose\", which is not a chemical. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a chemical entity."}
