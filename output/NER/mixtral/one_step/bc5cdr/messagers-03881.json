The other terms such as \"BaCl2\", \"chloroform-adrenaline\", \"strophantine G\", and \"aconitine\" are chemical substances or drugs used in the experimental conditions, and they do not clearly refer to any disease. Therefore, I have identified \"arrhythmia\" as the disease entity in this paragraph."}
