The other term \"thermal sensitivity\" is not a disease entity, but rather a measurement or test for pain sensitivity. Similarly, \"acetic acid - induced writhing\" is a test or procedure used to measure pain sensitivity, not a disease."}

Also, \"OIH\" is a medical term and could be considered an \"Observed Clinical Finding\" rather than a \"Chemical,\" but I included it as requested."},
