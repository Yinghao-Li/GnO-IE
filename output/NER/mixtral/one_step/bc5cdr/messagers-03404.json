It is a herbicide used in agriculture and is the subject of the study mentioned in the title. Therefore, the table above contains one row with 'metolachlor' in the 'Chemical' column.\n\nOriginal paragraph:\n\nParagraph: The Agricultural Health Study is a large prospective study of agricultural workers, their spouses, and their children. This study has been investigating the relationship between pesticide exposure and health outcomes for over 25 years. One pesticide that has been studied extensively in this cohort is metolachlor, a herbicide commonly used in agriculture.\n\nUpdated paragraph: Cancer incidence and metolachlor use in the Agricultural Health Study : An update .\n\nIn the original paragraph, 'pesticide' and 'herbicide' are not specific chemical entities, but categories of chemicals. Therefore, they were not included in the table. The term 'metolachlor' is a specific chemical entity and was included in the table."}
