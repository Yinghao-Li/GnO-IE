These are both related to Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBeAg stands for Hepatitis B e Antigen and is a protein produced by the HBV. Anti-HBe is an antibody produced by the body's immune system in response to HBeAg. The presence of HBeAg indicates that the virus is actively replicating, while the presence of anti-HBe indicates that the body has developed an immune response to the virus."},

However, this is not a disease itself but rather a measurement that can indicate liver damage or disease. Therefore, there are no clear disease entities in the paragraph."}

HBeAg is a protein produced by the hepatitis B virus, and anti - HBe is the antibody produced by the human body in response to the HBeAg protein. Therefore, they do not fit the category of \"Chemical\"."}
