Other terms such as \"busulfan\" and \"clonazepam\" refer to drugs or medications, not diseases. Therefore, they should not be included in the list of disease entities. The term \"treatment\" is also not a disease entity, but rather a general term that refers to the management or care of a disease. Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"neurological symptoms\"."}
