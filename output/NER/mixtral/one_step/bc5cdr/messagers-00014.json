Even though they are not chemical names, I included them in the table because they are relevant to understanding the concentration of ammonium ions in the study.\n3. \"626 + / - 431\" is another numerical value, representing the mean and standard deviation of plasma ammonium levels. Again, I included it in the table for completeness."},
