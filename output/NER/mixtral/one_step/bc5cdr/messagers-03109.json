Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. It is a normal physiological process that plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining the health of the body by eliminating old, damaged, or unneeded cells. However, excessive or insufficient apoptosis can lead to various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of apoptosis and its regulation is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies for these diseases."},

Aconitine is a toxic compound found in the roots and leaves of various plants of the genus Aconitum, and it is not a disease. Therefore, it should not be included in the list of disease entities.
