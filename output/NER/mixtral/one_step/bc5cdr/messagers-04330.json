In the given paragraph, the only entity that refers to a medical condition is \"GM-mediated nephropathy,\" which is a type of kidney disease. Therefore, the valid entity is \"GM-mediated nephropathy.\" All other entities in the paragraph refer to biochemical substances or processes, not diseases."}
