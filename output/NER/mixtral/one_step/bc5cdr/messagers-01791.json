Hyperinsulinemia: It is a condition in which there are high levels of insulin in the blood.\n2. Insulin: It is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar (glucose) from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store glucose for future use.\n3. Insulin resistance: It is a condition in which the body's cells do not respond normally to insulin. As a result, the body needs to produce more insulin to help glucose enter cells. Over time, this can lead to high levels of glucose in the blood, which can cause a variety of health problems."},

Hyperinsulinemia refers to a high level of insulin in the blood, while insulin resistance is a condition in which the body's cells do not respond normally to insulin."}
