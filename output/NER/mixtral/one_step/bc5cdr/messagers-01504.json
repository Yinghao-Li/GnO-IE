SNR: It is an abbreviation that could potentially stand for a chemical compound or a chemical reaction. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the exact chemical meaning of SNR.\n\n2. Immunohistochemical: It is a technique used in pathology to detect the presence and location of specific antigens or proteins in tissues. Although it is not a chemical itself, it is a chemical-based technique, and therefore, it is included in the table."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| immunohistochemical |\n\nExplanation:\n\nAfter reviewing the previous answer, I realized that SNR is not a chemical entity, and it is likely an abbreviation for a medical term. Therefore, the revised table only includes the following chemical entity:\n\n1. Immunohistochemical: It is a technique used in pathology to detect the presence and location of specific antigens or proteins in tissues. It is a chemical-based technique, and therefore, it is included in the table."}
