Fasciculation refers to the involuntary contraction and relaxation of muscle fibers, while myalgia refers to muscle pain. These are the two conditions that were reported to have been reduced with the use of precurarization with 0.04 mg/kg rocuronium."},

The term \"onset time\" refers to the time it takes for a drug to take effect, and \"precurarization\" refers to the administration of a muscle relaxant before the induction of anesthesia. These terms are not diseases and do not need to be included in the table."}
