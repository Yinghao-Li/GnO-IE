Azotemia refers to a condition of increased levels of nitrogenous waste products in the blood, typically caused by kidney dysfunction. Therefore, it is a disease or medical condition. The other term \"side effect\" is not a disease itself, but rather a consequence of a disease or treatment. Hence, it is not included in the table."},
