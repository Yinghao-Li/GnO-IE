However, there are mentions of certain receptors, which are important components in various diseases and medical conditions. Here are the identified entities:\n\n1. 5-HT1A receptor: This serotonin receptor is involved in several physiological and pathological processes, including mood regulation, anxiety, and addiction.\n2. 5-HT2A receptor: This serotonin receptor is associated with several psychiatric and neurological conditions, such as depression, schizophrenia, and migraine.\n3. D2 receptor: This dopamine receptor is linked to various diseases, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.\n\nThese entities are presented as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\", even though they are technically receptors, as they are closely related to various diseases and medical conditions."},
