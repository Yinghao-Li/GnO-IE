Ischemia refers to the restriction of blood supply to tissues, causing a lack of oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism. Reperfusion injury occurs when blood supply returns to the tissue after a period of ischemia, causing further damage due to the release of free radicals and other reactive species."},

In the original paragraph, there was only one disease-related entity, \"intestinal ischemia - reperfusion injury\". The term \"hepatic tissue total glutathione\" refers to a biochemical parameter and not a disease. Therefore, the table remains unchanged."}
