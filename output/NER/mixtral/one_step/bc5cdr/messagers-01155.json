Therefore, \"DOX-induced cardiotoxicity\" is the valid disease entity in the given paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| DOX-induced cardiotoxicity |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph only mentions one disease entity, which is \"DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.\" The other term, \"radical scavenging,\" refers to a property or action, not a disease. Therefore, the valid disease entity in the given paragraph is \"DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.\""}
