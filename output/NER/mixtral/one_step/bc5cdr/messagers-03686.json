However, it is important to note that \"CYA\" is actually an abbreviation for Cyclosporine A, which is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs. It is not a disease itself, but it is often used in the treatment of various diseases. Therefore, it may not be entirely accurate to label \"CYA\" as a disease entity in this context. Nonetheless, I have included it in the table as it is the only term in the paragraph that could potentially be associated with a disease."},
