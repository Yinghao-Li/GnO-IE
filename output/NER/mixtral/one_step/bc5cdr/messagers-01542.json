A corneal ulcer is an open sore on the cornea, the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. It's important to note that the paragraph mentions \"Corneal ulcers\" as a condition associated with \"aerosolized crack cocaine use,\" but the disease itself is the corneal ulcer."},

The other term, \"aerosolized crack cocaine use,\" is not a disease but rather a risk factor or a cause associated with the disease. Therefore, the table only includes \"Corneal ulcers\" as the valid disease entity."}
