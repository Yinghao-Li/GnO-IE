The phrase \"delayed reactions of 24 hours and 48 hours by IDR and patch tests to only some PRC\" refers to the results of skin tests, but it does not explicitly name any specific diseases. Therefore, I have listed the entire phrase as the only potential disease entity, although it is not a well-defined disease."}
