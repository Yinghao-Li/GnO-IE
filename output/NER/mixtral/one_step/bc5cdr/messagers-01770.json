The term \"non-hematological toxicities\" is not a disease but a general category of adverse effects that do not affect the blood or bone marrow. Therefore, it is not included in the table. Similarly, the phrase \"grade 3 - 4 hematological toxicities\" is a category of severity for hematological toxicities, not a specific disease. The specific diseases within this category are \"lymphopenia\" and \"neutropenia,\" which are the only entities presented in the table."}

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| lymphopenia |\n| neutropenia |\n\nIn this revised list, I have removed the term \"non-hematological\" because it does not clearly refer to a specific chemical entity. Instead, it is a general category of medical conditions that may or may not involve chemical processes. The remaining two entities, \"lymphopenia\" and \"neutropenia,\" are specific medical conditions that involve a decrease in the number of certain types of white blood cells, and are therefore chemical entities."}
