Additionally, I have included \"chemotherapy with epirubicin and paclitaxel\" as another disease entity since chemotherapy is often used to treat various medical conditions, including different types of cancer. However, it is possible to argue that chemotherapy is not a disease itself, but rather a treatment for diseases."},

The term \"chemotherapy\" is a type of medical treatment that uses chemicals, but it is not a chemical itself. Therefore, it should not be included in the table. Similarly, \"peri-operative atrioventricular block\" is a medical condition, not a chemical, and should not be included in the table."}
