However, SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) are often used in the context of genetics and biochemistry, respectively. While SNP is not a disease, it is a type of genetic variation that can be associated with certain diseases. ATP is a molecule that provides energy to cells and is not a disease itself. However, since the prompt asks for \"Disease\" entities, I have included both SNP and ATP in the table as they are related to the medical field."},
