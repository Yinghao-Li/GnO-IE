Hyperkalemia refers to an elevated level of potassium in the blood. The other terms mentioned, such as spiranolactone, aldosterone antagonist, and ACE inhibitor, are related to medications or substances, not diseases."},

Both of these drugs can contribute to the condition of hyperkalemia, as mentioned in the paragraph."},

I have removed any ambiguity by only listing these two terms, as they are the only unambiguous chemical entities in the paragraph. The terms \"aldosterone antagonist\" and \"ACE inhibitor\" are classes of drugs or mechanisms of action and not specific chemical entities, so they have been excluded from the table."}
