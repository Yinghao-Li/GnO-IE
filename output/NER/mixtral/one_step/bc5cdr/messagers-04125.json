Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that helps stimulate milk production in women who are breastfeeding. In non-pregnant, non-lactating individuals, high prolactin levels can lead to various symptoms, such as menstrual irregularities, infertility, and reduced sexual desire. In this paragraph, the term \"hyperprolactinemia\" is explicitly mentioned, and it is considered a disease entity."},

Instead, it describes a physiological response to a specific stimulus (LH-RH). Therefore, it is not included in the table."}
