Ischemic stroke is a disease that occurs when a blood clot blocks the blood supply to a part of the brain, causing damage to brain cells."},

After reviewing the paragraph again, I realized that there are no non-disease entities that need to be removed. Therefore, the same table as before is still valid."}

Myocardial infarction is a heart attack caused by the blockage of blood flow to a part of the heart muscle, while ischemic stroke is a type of stroke caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain."}
