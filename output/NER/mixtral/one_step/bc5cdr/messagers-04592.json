MK - 801: It is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist.\n4. pilocarpine: It is a cholinergic agonist used in the treatment of glaucoma and dry mouth.\n5. pyramidal cells of hippocampus: Although not a chemical, I included it as it is a specific type of neuron located in the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in learning and memory."},
