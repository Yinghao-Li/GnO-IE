Severe left ventricular dysfunction: This is a disease condition where the left ventricle of the heart loses its ability to pump blood efficiently, which can lead to heart failure.\n2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: This is a type of cardiomyopathy where the heart muscle becomes weakened, stretched, and thin, leading to an enlarged heart chamber (ventricle) and reduced heart function.\n3. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): This is a rapid heart rhythm originating from the lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart, which can lead to decreased blood flow to the body and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly."},
