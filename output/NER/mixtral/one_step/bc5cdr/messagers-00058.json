Apoptosis is a programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. It is a normal physiological process that plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining the health of the body by eliminating old cells, unnecessary cells, and unhealthy cells. Therefore, apoptosis can be considered a disease when it occurs abnormally, leading to various health issues."},
