The phrase \"adverse reactions\" is a general term that can refer to negative responses to a treatment or substance, but it does not specifically refer to a disease. Therefore, it should not be included as a disease entity."}

Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. Therefore, it is identified as a chemical entity and presented in the table."},
