Although VIP is not a disease, I included it in the table as it is the only entity mentioned in the paragraph that could potentially be related to disease, as it is a neurotransmitter involved in various physiological functions. However, it is important to note that the context of the paragraph does not provide enough information to confirm that VIP is being mentioned in the context of a disease."}
