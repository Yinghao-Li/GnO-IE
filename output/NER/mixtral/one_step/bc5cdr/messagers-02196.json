Drug: This is a broad term for any chemical substance used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease.\n2. Immune hemolytic anemia: This is a condition in which the body's immune system produces antibodies that destroy its own red blood cells, leading to anemia.\n3. Direct antiglobulin test: Also known as the direct Coombs test, it is a laboratory test used to detect the presence of antibodies or complement components on the surface of red blood cells.\n4. Eluate: This is the liquid that is obtained by washing or rinsing something, in this case, the eluate is the liquid obtained by washing the red blood cells in the direct antiglobulin test.\n5. Microspherocytes: These are small, dense, and round red blood cells that can be seen on a blood smear in certain types of anemia, such as immune hemolytic anemia.\n6. Pre - and post - transfusion: These are terms used to describe the time before and after a blood transfusion, respectively."},
