Other terms such as \"central venous pressure\", \"left ventricular end-diastolic pressure\", \"total peripheral resistance\", \"rate pressure product\", and \"oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood\" are medical conditions or measurements, but they are not diseases in themselves. \"Hypotension\" is the only term that is clearly a disease and is mentioned in the paragraph."}
