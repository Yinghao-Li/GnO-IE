It is a condition that causes the breakdown of muscle fibers, leading to the release of muscle contents (myoglobin) into the bloodstream. This can result in kidney damage or failure. In this case, rhabdomyolysis occurred after an increase in the dose of clarithromycin, which is an antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| rhabdomyolysis |\n\nExplanation: In the given paragraph, the only disease entity is \"rhabdomyolysis\". The term \"clarithromycin\" refers to a medication and not a disease, so it is not included in the table. Rhabdomyolysis is a specific medical condition that can occur as a side effect of clarithromycin, but it is not the medication itself. Therefore, the table only includes \"rhabdomyolysis\" as the valid disease entity."}
