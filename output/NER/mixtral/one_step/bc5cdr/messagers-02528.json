These are medical conditions that can affect the heart's rhythm and function. Ventricular tachycardia is a rapid heartbeat that originates in the lower chambers of the heart, while fibrillation is a chaotic, irregular heartbeat. QRS prolongation refers to a delay in the electrical conduction of the heart, which can lead to a decreased heart rate and reduced blood flow to the body."},
