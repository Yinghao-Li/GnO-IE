TNF stands for Tumor Necrosis Factor, which is a type of cytokine involved in inflammation and immunity. PAF stands for Platelet-Activating Factor, which is a type of lipid mediator involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Neither TNF nor PAF is a disease entity. Therefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities to extract from the given paragraph."},

Although TNF is sometimes associated with certain diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, it is not a disease itself. Similarly, PAF is not a disease entity. Therefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities to extract from the given paragraph."}
