The terms \"Na / K - ATPase\", \"NHE3\", \"NBC1\", \"AQP1\", and \"OAT\" are not diseases, but rather proteins or transporters that are involved in various physiological processes. Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"Gentamicin-induced Nephropathy\", which is a kidney disease caused by the administration of the antibiotic gentamicin."}

Gentamicin: It is an antibiotic used to treat various types of bacterial infections.\n3. NHE3: It is a type of protein that is responsible for the transport of sodium and hydrogen ions in the kidney.\n4. NBC1: It is a type of protein that is responsible for the transport of sodium and bicarbonate ions in the kidney.\n5. AQP1: It is a type of protein that is responsible for the transport of water in the kidney.\n6. OAT: It is a type of protein that is responsible for the transport of organic anions in the kidney."},

The other entities mentioned in the paragraph are either not clearly chemical entities or are abbreviations that need further context to determine if they refer to chemical entities. Therefore, I have only included Gentamicin in the table."}
