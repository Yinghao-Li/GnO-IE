However, since the paragraph mentions that \"Helodermin produced hypotension,\" it is appropriate to include this as a disease entity with the modifier \"Helodermin-induced\" to indicate the context in which it is mentioned. The other terms mentioned, such as \"dose-dependent manner\" and \"approximately similar potency and duration,\" are not disease entities. Therefore, the valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"Helodermin-induced hypotension.\""}
