The other terms such as \"propranolol\", \"volume loading\", \"cardiopulmonary bypass\", and \"echocardiography\" are medical procedures or drugs, and not diseases. Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"Acute heart failure\"."},

The term \"absence of MR\" is not a disease, but rather a description of a negative finding on an echocardiogram. Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"Acute heart failure\", which is presented in the table above."}
