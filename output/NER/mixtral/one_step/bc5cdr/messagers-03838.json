Propranolol: It is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as beta blockers. It is used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, angina, and other heart conditions.\n2. PPA (Phenylpropanolamine): It is a decongestant and appetite suppressant. It is used in over-the-counter and prescription medications to relieve nasal congestion and to reduce appetite.\n3. Norepinephrine: It is a hormone and neurotransmitter that is secreted by the adrenal glands and is released into the bloodstream as well as being released into the synapse by the postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic nervous system. It is involved in the fight or flight response and has various effects on the body, including increasing heart rate and blood pressure."},
