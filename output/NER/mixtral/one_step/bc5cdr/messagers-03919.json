Similarly, \"convulsions\" and \"marked central excitatory actions\" are physiological responses to chemical substances. Therefore, they are not included as chemical entities in the table."},

The other terms, such as \"loss of consciousness,\" \"central depression and excitation,\" \"convulsions,\" and \"marked central excitatory actions\" are physiological states or effects caused by chemical substances, but they are not chemical entities themselves. Therefore, the table only includes the term \"doses\" as a chemical entity."}
