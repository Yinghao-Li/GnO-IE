The term \"EE\" is mentioned, which could potentially be interpreted as a disease abbreviation, but it is more likely to refer to \"ethinylestradiol,\" a synthetic form of estrogen used in hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, I have included it in the table with that interpretation, but it is not a well-known disease abbreviation."}
