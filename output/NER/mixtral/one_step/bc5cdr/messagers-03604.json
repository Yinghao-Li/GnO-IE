I identified two disease entities in the paragraph: \"high-dose etoposide therapy\" and \"malignant glioma.\"\n2. \"High-dose etoposide therapy\" is a treatment that involves administering high doses of the chemotherapy drug etoposide. It is considered a disease entity because it can cause complications and toxicities, as mentioned in the paragraph.\n3. \"Malignant glioma\" is a type of brain tumor that is highly aggressive and difficult to treat. It is considered a disease entity because it is a medical condition that can be treated with high-dose etoposide therapy.\n4. I presented the entities in a Markdown table with one column named \"Disease\" to clearly display the identified disease entities."},
