VGPR stands for \"very good partial response,\" which is a term used to describe a patient's response to cancer treatment. Since the context of the paragraph is about patients improving from one disease state (before consolidation therapy) to another disease state (after consolidation therapy), it is appropriate to identify \"VGPR\" as a disease entity."},
