It is used to express measurements such as temperature, angles, and concentrations. In this case, it is used to express the angle of mean right eye misalignment (MRD)."},

Other terms such as \"range,\" \"t-test,\" and \"P\" are statistical terms and do not refer to chemicals. Therefore, the updated table only includes \"degrees\" as the valid chemical entity."}
