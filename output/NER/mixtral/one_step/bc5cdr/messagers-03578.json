Fasciculations refer to sudden, involuntary muscle twitches, which can be a symptom of various neuromuscular disorders. However, in this context, it is not explicitly stated that the muscle fasciculations are a disease or a disorder, but it is mentioned as an observable phenomenon caused by suxamethonium in healthy children. Nonetheless, I have included it as a disease entity for the sake of comprehensiveness."},
