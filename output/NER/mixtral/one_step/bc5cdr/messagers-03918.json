A convulsion is a sudden, violent, involuntary contraction of a muscle or a group of muscles, often a result of epileptic seizures or another neurological disorder. Therefore, it is identified as a disease entity."},

Although not a disease itself, a \"lethal dose\" refers to the amount of a substance (such as a toxin or drug) that can cause death. This concept is often used in medical and toxicological contexts, so it is identified as a disease entity."}

However, it is important to note that \"lethal dose\" is a general term and does not refer to a specific chemical compound."},

While it is a general term and does not refer to a specific chemical compound, it is commonly used in toxicology and pharmacology to describe the amount of a substance required to cause a particular effect, such as death."}
