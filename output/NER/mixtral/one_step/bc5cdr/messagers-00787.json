Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion as a disease entity."}

These are conditions where the body or a specific part of the body, in this case, the cortical laminar, experiences a lack of energy, possibly due to a deficiency in energy-providing substances such as glucose or ATP."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| energy depletions |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised question, I have removed entities that do not clearly refer to \"Chemical\". The only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"energy depletions\", which refers to a condition of energy deficiency. Therefore, the valid chemical entity is presented in a Markdown table with one column \"Chemical\"."}
