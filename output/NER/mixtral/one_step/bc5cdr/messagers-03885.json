Recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage: A hemorrhage is a type of disease or medical condition where there is bleeding. Subarachnoid hemorrhage refers to bleeding in the space surrounding the brain. When it is recurrent, it means that it has happened more than once.\n2. acute renal artery thrombosis: A thrombosis is a disease or medical condition where a blood clot forms inside a blood vessel and blocks the flow of blood. Renal artery thrombosis refers to a blood clot that forms in the renal artery, which is the main blood vessel that supplies blood to the kidney. When it is acute, it means that it has happened suddenly."},
