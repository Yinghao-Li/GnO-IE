The term \"experimentally induced status epilepticus\" refers to a laboratory procedure used to study the disease, rather than the disease itself, so it is not included as a separate entity. The term \"subsequently induced seizures\" also refers to the disease, so it is included as a synonym for \"seizures\". The term \"behavioral parameters\" does not clearly refer to a disease, so it is not included as an entity."}
