It is a dopamine D2 receptor, which is a type of protein that is involved in the transmission of signals in the brain. It is not a chemical in the traditional sense, but it is a chemical entity in the context of genetics and biochemistry. The term \"DRD2 gene\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a genetic entity that encodes the DRD2 protein. Therefore, I have removed \"gene\" from the entity name and presented it as \"DRD2\" in the table."}
