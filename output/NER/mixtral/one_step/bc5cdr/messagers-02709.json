It is a pathological process that causes damage to neurons due to the overactivation of receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species), nitrite, and Ca (2+), are not diseases but rather molecular species or ions. Similarly, mitochondrial activity is a biological process and not a disease."},

The phrase \"mitochondrial activity\" was not included because it refers to a biological process rather than a specific chemical entity."}
