Antimicrobials are a type of chemical substance or agent that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, or protozoans. The word \"systemic\" describes how these antimicrobials are administered, but it is not a chemical entity itself. Similarly, \"ocular\" describes the adverse effects' location, but it is not a chemical. Therefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"antimicrobials.\""},
