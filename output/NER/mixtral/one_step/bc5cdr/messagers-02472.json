    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| acute rejection |\n| chronic rejection |\n| interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy |\n| recurrent or de novo glomerulopathy |\n\nAfter reviewing the paragraph again, I still find that the four entities identified in my previous response are the only ones that refer to diseases. \"Acute rejection\" and \"chronic rejection\" are specific conditions that can occur after organ transplantation. \"Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy\" is a pattern of injury that can occur in various kidney diseases. \"Recurrent or de novo glomerulopathy\" refers to a new or recurring kidney disease affecting the glomeruli, the filtering units of the kidney. Therefore, I did not remove any entities from my previous response."}

Therefore, there are no chemical entities to present in a table."}
