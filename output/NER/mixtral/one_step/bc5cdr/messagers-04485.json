Similarly, \"pathological changes\" is a general term that can refer to any changes in tissues or organs that are caused by disease, but it is not a specific disease itself. However, in this context, \"pathological changes in the urinary tract\" is used to refer to a specific condition or set of conditions affecting the urinary tract, so it is included as a disease entity."}
