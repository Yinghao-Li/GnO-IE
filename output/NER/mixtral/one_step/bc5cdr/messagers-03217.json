CsA: It is a chemical abbreviation for Cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressive drug.\n2. TGF - b: It stands for Transforming Growth Factor-beta, a protein that regulates cell growth and division.\n3. NF - kb: It is an abbreviation for Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, a protein complex that controls transcription of DNA.\n4. mTOR: It stands for mammalian target of rapamycin, a protein that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism.\n5. PCNA: It is an abbreviation for Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen, a protein associated with DNA replication and repair.\n6. TP53: It is an abbreviation for Tumor Protein p53, a protein that regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis.\n7. KIM - 1: It stands for Kidney Injury Molecule-1, a protein used as a biomarker for kidney injury.\n8. CTGF: It stands for Connective Tissue Growth Factor, a protein that plays a role in wound healing and fibrosis."},

NF-kB and PCNA are proteins, TP53 is a tumor suppressor protein, KIM-1 is a protein used as a biomarker for kidney injury, and CTGF is a growth factor. Therefore, they do not meet the criteria for being classified as chemicals."}
