However, since the paragraph only explicitly mentions \"acute cardiotoxicity\" as the disease, I have only listed that as a valid entity. If we assume that DOX is being mentioned in the context of it causing acute cardiotoxicity, then it could also be considered a disease entity, but I have listed it separately as \"DOX\" to reflect the ambiguity."},
