Hypersensitivity refers to an exaggerated response by the immune system to a substance, and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are a type of medication commonly used to treat pain, inflammation, and fever. The specific NSAID referred to as \"P\" is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that some patients have an adverse reaction to it. Similarly, the specific classic NSAIDs associated with reactions are not mentioned, but it is clear that some patients have a hypersensitivity to them."},

While \"associated reactions to classic NSAIDs\" could be interpreted as a disease, it is more accurately described as an adverse reaction to a medication, rather than a disease itself. Therefore, it has been excluded from the table. The specific NSAID referred to as \"P\" is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that some patients have an adverse reaction to it."}
