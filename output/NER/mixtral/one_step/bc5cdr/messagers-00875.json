Anemia is a condition characterized by a lack of sufficient healthy red blood cells or insufficient hemoglobin to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. In this case, the anemia is said to be \"ribavirin-induced,\" which means that it is a side effect of taking the medication ribavirin. Therefore, the valid disease entity is \"ribavirin-induced anemia.\""},
