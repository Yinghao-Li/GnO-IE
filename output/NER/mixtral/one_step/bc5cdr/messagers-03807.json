Therefore, it is not included in the table. Similarly, the phrase \"early hours\" is a time reference and not a disease, so it is not included in the table. The term \"suspected\" is an adjective modifying the noun \"myocardial infarction,\" and it is not a disease, so it is not included in the table."}
