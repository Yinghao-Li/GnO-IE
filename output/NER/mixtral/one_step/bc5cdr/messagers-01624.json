It is a cluster of neurons located in the spinal cord that plays a crucial role in sensory perception. The paragraph mentions increases in p75 (NTR) - IR (Immunoreactivity) in DRG cell bodies and pericellular regions, but it does not explicitly mention any specific diseases associated with these increases."},

However, in this context, DRG is not being used as a disease but rather as a structure or region of the nervous system. Therefore, I cannot provide any valid disease entities from the given paragraph."}
