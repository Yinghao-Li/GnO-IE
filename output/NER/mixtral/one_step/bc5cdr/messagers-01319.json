However, it's important to note that \"not meeting response criteria\" is not a disease itself, but rather a description of a patient's response to treatment. The response criteria in this context likely refer to certain clinical measures used to assess the effectiveness of a treatment. Therefore, it's a bit of a stretch to consider this a \"disease\" entity, but I have included it in the table since it was the only phrase in the paragraph that could potentially fit the category."},

The first one, olanzapine, is mentioned in the context of the number of subjects who took it and met certain response criteria. The second one, risperidone, is also mentioned in the same context.\n\nTo identify these entities, I looked for words that referred to specific substances or compounds. I then checked these words against a list of known chemicals to confirm their validity. In this case, both olanzapine and risperidone are well-known antipsychotic drugs, so they are valid chemical entities.\n\nI presented these entities in a Markdown table with one column labeled \"Chemical.\" This format is commonly used for presenting tabular data in a clear and concise way. Each row of the table contains one chemical entity, listed exactly as it appears in the original paragraph. This ensures that the entities are presented precisely and accurately."},
