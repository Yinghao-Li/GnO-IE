Beta-agonists are a type of medication that widens the airways in the lungs, and they are often inhaled to treat conditions like asthma and COPD. Ipratropium bromide is a specific type of beta-agonist that is used as a rescue medication to quickly open up the airways during an asthma attack or other respiratory distress. These entities are mentioned as substances that are used during the run-in and washout periods of a study, so it is important to identify them precisely as they are described in the text."},
