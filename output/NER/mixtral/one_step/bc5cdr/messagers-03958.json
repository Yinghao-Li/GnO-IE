However, there are two medical conditions or targets of hormonal therapy mentioned - \"mammary\" and \"endometrial\". These are not diseases by themselves, but they can be affected by certain medical conditions. For example, mammary tissue can be affected by breast cancer, and endometrial tissue can be affected by endometrial cancer.\n\nTherefore, I have presented the entities as \"Mammary\" and \"Endometrial\" in the table above."},

They are synthetic or naturally occurring forms of progesterone.\n2. estrogenic stimulation: Estrogen is a steroid hormone that is often used in hormonal replacement therapy. Estrogenic stimulation refers to the effects of estrogen on target tissues.\n3. hormonal replacement therapy: This is a medical treatment that involves replacing hormones that are at low levels in the body. It is often used to treat symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness."},
