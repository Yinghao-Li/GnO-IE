It is a synthetic opioid medication used to treat pain and as a maintenance anti-addictive treatment in opioid dependence. The term \"QT interval\" refers to a measurement of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. The phrase \"in vitro\" means that the experiment was performed in a controlled laboratory environment, typically using test tubes, petri dishes, or cell culture plates. Therefore, \"Methadone\" is the only chemical entity in the paragraph."},
