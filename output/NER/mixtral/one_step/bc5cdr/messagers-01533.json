    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| galactosamine |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only clear chemical entity mentioned is \"galactosamine\". The term \"biodegradable conjugate\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a type of molecule or compound that contains a chemical entity. Therefore, it is not included in the table above. Similarly, \"liver\" is an organ and not a chemical entity, so it is not included in the table."}
