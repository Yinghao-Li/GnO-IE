Serotonin is a type of neurotransmitter and is therefore a chemical.\n2. fluoxetine: This is an antidepressant drug that is also known by its brand name Prozac. It is a chemical compound.\n3. levodopa: This is a precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine and is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a chemical compound.\n4. dopamine agonist: This is a type of drug that mimics the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, in the brain. It is a chemical compound.\n5. parkinsonian motor disability: This refers to the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with movement. While not a chemical itself, it is included here because it is being compared to the effects of increased brain serotoninergic transmission with fluoxetine."},
