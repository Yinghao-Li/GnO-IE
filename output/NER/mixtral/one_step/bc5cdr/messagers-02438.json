IFO is an abbreviation for ifosfamide, a chemotherapeutic drug used to treat various cancers. Therefore, IFO's genotoxicity implies the adverse effect of ifosfamide on the genetic material of cells, which can lead to diseases such as cancer."},

Therefore, IFO's genotoxicity is a valid disease entity in this context."}
