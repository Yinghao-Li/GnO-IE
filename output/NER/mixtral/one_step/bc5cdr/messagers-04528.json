Myocardial infarction refers to a heart attack, and in this case, it is induced by isoproterenol, which is a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor agonist used in medicine. Therefore, the entire phrase \"isoproterenol - induced myocardial infarction\" refers to a specific medical condition and is considered a single disease entity."},
