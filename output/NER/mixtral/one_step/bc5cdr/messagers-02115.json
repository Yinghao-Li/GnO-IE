Cimetidine is a histamine-2 receptor antagonist, which is used to treat and prevent ulcers in the stomach and intestines. Histamine is a chemical that is released by immune cells in response to an allergen, which causes an allergic reaction. In this context, cimetidine is acting as a histamine agonist, which means it binds to and activates histamine receptors."},
