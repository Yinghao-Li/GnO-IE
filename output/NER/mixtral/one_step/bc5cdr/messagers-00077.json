However, since the context of the paragraph mentions a decrease in the number of these neurons in animals treated with haloperidol and L-NOARG, it can be inferred that there might be some neurological condition or disease associated with the decrease in NADPH-d neurons. Nonetheless, without further context or information, it is not possible to definitively classify NADPH-d as a disease."},

Although NADPH-d is not explicitly stated as a disease, it is a term that often refers to a specific type of neuron. However, in this context, it is unclear whether the decrease in NADPH-d neurons is a symptom of a disease or a side effect of the treatments. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively classify NADPH-d as a disease. Nonetheless, since the prompt only asks for entities that \"clearly\" refer to a disease, I have removed NADPH-d from the list of valid entities."}
