Therefore, \"cardiac damage\" is the disease entity in this paragraph. The term \"significant\" is not a disease entity, it is a descriptor of the cardiac damage. The term \"treatment with DOX\" is not a disease entity, it is a treatment that causes the disease. The term \"saline control group\" is not a disease entity, it is a comparison group for the experiment."}
