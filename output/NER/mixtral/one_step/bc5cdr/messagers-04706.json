Neurotoxicity refers to damage to the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves caused by natural or artificial toxic substances. In this context, it is described as \"serious,\" indicating a severe form of the condition."},

Methotrexate is a medication used to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases, and its levels in cerebrospinal fluid are monitored to assess the risk of neurotoxicity."}
