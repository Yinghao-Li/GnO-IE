Peliosis is a vascular disorder, and hepatic tumors can be benign or malignant. However, without further context, it is not clear if the peliosis and hepatic tumors in this paragraph are diseases or symptoms of an underlying disease.\n* Well - differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma is a type of liver cancer and is a clear example of a disease."}
