The other term \"normokalemic\" is a condition where the potassium level is within the normal range, and it does not refer to a specific disease. Therefore, the valid disease entity is:\n\n* Hypokalemia: This is a condition characterized by low potassium levels in the blood. It is explicitly mentioned in the paragraph as one of the conditions studied in the patients."}
