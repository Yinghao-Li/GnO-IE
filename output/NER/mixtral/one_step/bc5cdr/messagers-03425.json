This phrase suggests the presence of diseases that are not yet apparent or have not been diagnosed but are expected to develop in the future. Therefore, I have identified \"latent disease outcomes\" as the disease entity in the provided paragraph."},

The term \"early-life exposure\" does not directly refer to a disease but rather to potential factors that might contribute to the development of diseases. Therefore, I have only identified \"latent disease outcomes\" as the disease entity in the provided paragraph."}
