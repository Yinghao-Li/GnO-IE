Torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia: This is a specific type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, and is considered a disease.\n2. dilated cardiomyopathy: This is a disease that affects the heart muscle, causing it to become enlarged and weakened.\n3. congestive heart failure: This is a disease that occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to fluid buildup in the body."},
