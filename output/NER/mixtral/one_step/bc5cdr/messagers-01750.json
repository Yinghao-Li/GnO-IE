Propranolol is a type of medication called a beta blocker, which is used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, and angina (chest pain). Therefore, the valid chemical entity in this paragraph is \"optical isomers of propranolol.\""},

Similarly, the term \"biological properties\" refers to the characteristics of a biological system, which is not a chemical entity. Therefore, these terms have been excluded from the table."}
