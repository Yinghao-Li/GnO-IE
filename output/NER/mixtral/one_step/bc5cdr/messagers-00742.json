The term \"blood\" in \"do not require blood level monitoring\" does not clearly refer to a chemical, so it has been removed. The other terms in the paragraph, such as \"safer\", \"disease\", \"symptoms\", \"exercise tolerance\", and \"mortality\" do not refer to chemical entities and have also been removed."}
