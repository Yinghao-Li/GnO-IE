Lipid emulsion: It is a formulation of essential fatty acids, lipid-soluble vitamins, and other ingredients, used in total parenteral nutrition.\n2. epinephrine: Also known as adrenaline, it is a hormone, neurotransmitter, and medication. It is often used in emergency situations to treat severe allergic reactions, cardiac arrest, and other medical conditions."},
