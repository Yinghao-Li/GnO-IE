    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| cocaine-induced locomotor activity |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised request, I am asked to remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease.\" In the original paragraph, all the mentioned entities are related to adenosine receptor agonists and their effects on cocaine-induced locomotor activity. None of them explicitly refer to a disease. However, \"cocaine-induced locomotor activity\" can be considered an abnormal behavior or condition caused by cocaine use, and thus, it can be classified as a \"Disease\" entity. Therefore, the valid entity is still \"cocaine-induced locomotor activity.\""}
