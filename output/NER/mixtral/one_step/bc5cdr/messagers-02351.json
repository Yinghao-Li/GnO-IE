Cystitis is the inflammation of the bladder, and in this context, it is induced by the administration of the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide. Therefore, the entire phrase \"cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis\" is considered a single disease entity."},

The other terms, such as \"P2X3 receptor\" and \"NK1 receptor antagonists,\" are related to receptors or drugs, not diseases."}

Therefore, the only valid chemical entity in the paragraph is \"cyclophosphamide,\" which is a well-known alkylating anticancer drug."}
