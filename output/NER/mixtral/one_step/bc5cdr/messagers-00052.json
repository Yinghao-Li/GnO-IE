Therefore, it can be considered as a disease entity.\n\nOn the other hand, human bone marrow progenitor (HBMP) cells are not a disease but rather a type of stem cell found in the bone marrow that can differentiate into various types of blood cells. Therefore, it is not considered a disease entity."}
