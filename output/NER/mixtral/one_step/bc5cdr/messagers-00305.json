The paragraph only discusses the number of infants excluded from a study and the reason for their exclusion, which is an insufficient medical and drug history. However, the term \"drug\" could potentially be considered a chemical, depending on the context. However, since the term \"drug\" is used in a general sense to refer to medication and not a specific chemical compound, I would not classify it as a chemical entity in this context."}
