Therefore, I have not made any changes to the previous table.\n\nNote that I have not included \"anxiety\" as a chemical entity, as it is not a chemical but rather a physiological or psychological state. Similarly, \"mice\" are not a chemical entity, but rather a type of animal used in the study."}
