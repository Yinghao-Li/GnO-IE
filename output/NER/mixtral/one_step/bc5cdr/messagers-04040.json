It is a risk factor or a predisposing condition that can lead to prolonged neuromuscular blockade.\n* Therefore, only \"prolonged neuromuscular blockade\" is included in the table as a valid disease entity."}

Anticholinesterases: These are a group of enzymes that inhibit the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n2. Prolonged neuromuscular blockade: This is a condition where the muscles remain relaxed for a longer time than normal, usually due to the administration of certain medications such as succinylcholine.\n3. Succinylcholine: This is a short-acting muscle relaxant that is often used during surgical procedures to facilitate endotracheal intubation.\n4. Atypical plasma cholinesterase: This is a type of cholinesterase that is less effective at breaking down certain drugs, such as succinylcholine, leading to prolonged neuromuscular blockade."},

Therefore, it has been excluded from the list of chemical entities."}
