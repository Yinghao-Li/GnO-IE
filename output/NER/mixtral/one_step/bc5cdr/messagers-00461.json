The term \"indinavir-related nephrotoxicity\" is not a disease per se but a side effect or complication related to the medication indinavir. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a disease entity."}

Although \"human immunodeficiency virus type 1\" is a virus and not a chemical, it is sometimes referred to as HIV-1, which can be abbreviated as a chemical compound in chemical databases. However, in this context, it is not clear that it is being used as a chemical entity, so it is not included in the table."}
