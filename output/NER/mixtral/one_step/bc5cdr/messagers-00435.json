The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, \"mice\" and \"untreated controls,\" do not refer to diseases.\n\n\"Mice\" is a general term for a group of rodents and does not refer to a specific disease. Similarly, \"untreated controls\" refers to a group of mice that did not receive any treatment, and it does not refer to a disease.\n\nTherefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"DBA / 2.\""}

In the previous answer, I identified the two strains of mice as the chemical entities in the paragraph. Since these are the only entities mentioned, and they are indeed genetic strains of mice, I will leave the previous answer as is."}
