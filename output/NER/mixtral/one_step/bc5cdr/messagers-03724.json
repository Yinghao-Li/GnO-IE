In this case, the convulsions are specifically induced by the administration of pilocarpine, which is a medication used to treat certain conditions but can also cause seizures or convulsions as a side effect. Therefore, \"pilocarpine-induced convulsions\" is the valid disease entity in the paragraph."},

Similarly, \"reduction of the threshold\" is a description of a medical phenomenon, but it does not refer to a disease. Therefore, the valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"pilocarpine-induced convulsions.\""}
