LPP stands for Lateral Posterior Parietal cortex, which is a region of the brain involved in sensory processing and attention. DG stands for Dentate Gyrus, which is a part of the hippocampus in the brain that plays a role in learning and memory. Although LPP and DG are not strictly chemicals, they are often referred to as such in the context of neuroscience research, where they are studied in relation to various chemical processes in the brain."},

LPP and DG are not chemicals, but rather regions of the brain. Therefore, there are no chemical entities to present in a table."}
