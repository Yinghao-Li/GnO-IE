It is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the formation of new blood vessels, thereby preventing the growth and spread of cancer cells.\n2. irinotecan: It is a chemotherapy medication used to treat colon or rectal cancer. It works by interfering with the DNA replication process in cancer cells, thereby preventing their growth and multiplication.\n\nBoth of these chemicals are mentioned in the context of being potential risk factors for CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) development, along with hypertension."},
