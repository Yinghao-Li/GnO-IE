The context suggests that this function was impaired, as it was restored after cessation of TDF (Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate), a medication used to treat chronic hepatitis B and HIV. Therefore, \"kidney function\" is identified as a disease entity."},

In this context, \"kidney function\" is the only clear disease entity. Although \"cessation of TDF\" is related to treating a disease, it does not directly refer to a disease itself. Therefore, no changes are made to the previous table."}
