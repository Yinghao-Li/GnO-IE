A \"dyscrasia\" is a medical term used to describe an abnormal condition of the blood. In this case, the abnormal condition is caused by a drug, making it a \"drug-induced blood dyscrasia.\" The term \"safe\" is not a disease entity, as it refers to a general concept rather than a specific medical condition."},
