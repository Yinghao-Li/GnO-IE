Therefore, it is not included in the final table.\n* \"digoxin excess\" is a condition where the level of digoxin (a medication used to treat heart conditions) in the body is too high, which can lead to various adverse effects. It is not a disease itself, but rather a side effect of medication use. Therefore, it is not included in the final table."}
