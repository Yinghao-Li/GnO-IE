These entities are mentioned as control groups and are likely referring to some chemical substances with the abbreviation \"SH\" and concentrations or dosages of 6 and 12.

The term \"vehicle\" is not a chemical entity, as it is a general term that can refer to a means of transportation or a carrier substance, but it does not refer to a specific chemical. Therefore, the table above only includes the entities \"SH (6)\" and \"SH (12)\" as chemical entities."}
