The glomeruli are a part of the kidney and the changes described, such as membrane spikes, prominent swelling of podocytes, and subepithelial deposits, are indicative of a type of kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. This condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and genetic disorders. The large, hump-like subepithelial deposits are a hallmark of a specific type of glomerulonephritis called membranous nephropathy."},

The glomeruli are a part of the kidney and the changes described, such as membrane spikes, prominent swelling of podocytes, and subepithelial deposits, are indicative of a type of kidney disease called glomerulonephritis.\n\nThe term \"glomerulonephritis\" is the only clear reference to a disease in the paragraph. The other terms, such as \"membrane spikes,\" \"prominent swelling of podocytes,\" and \"subepithelial deposits,\" are descriptive terms that refer to the physical changes seen in the glomeruli, but do not refer to a specific disease.\n\nTherefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"glomerulonephritis.\""}
