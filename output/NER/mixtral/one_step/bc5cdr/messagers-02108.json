Creatinine: It is a chemical waste molecule that's produced by your muscles and removed from your body by your kidneys.\n2. mg / dl: It is a unit of measurement for concentration. It stands for milligrams per deciliter.\n3. 1 . 46 + / - 0 . 8: It is a numerical value representing the concentration of creatinine in the PTRA group.\n4. 1 . 34 + / - 0 . 5 mg / dl: It is a numerical value representing the concentration of creatinine in the PTRA group after the procedure.\n5. PCI group: It is a group of patients who underwent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, a medical procedure. Although it is not a chemical, I have included it in the list because it was mentioned in the context of a change in creatinine levels.\n6. 1 . 44 + / - 0 . 6: It is a numerical value representing the concentration of creatinine in the PCI group before the procedure.\n7. 1 . 57 + / - 0 . 7 mg / dl: It is a numerical value representing the concentration of creatinine in the PCI group after the procedure."},
