It is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and the body's ability to detoxify these reactive products. Although it is not a traditional disease, it is a condition that can contribute to the development of various diseases."},

The other terms, such as \"lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation\" and \"irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membranes\" are not diseases, but rather consequences or results of a disease or condition. Therefore, the table only includes the term \"oxidant stress\" as a valid disease entity."}
