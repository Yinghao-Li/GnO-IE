    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| I/4e isopter |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe only possible chemical entity in the given paragraph is \"I/4e isopter\". It is mentioned in the context of Goldmann perimetry, which is a method used to measure visual fields. The \"I/4e isopter\" is a standardized light stimulus used in this test. It is not a chemical in the traditional sense, but it is a term used in the field of visual physiology and perimetry."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| I/4e isopter |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe revised answer only includes \"I/4e isopter\" as a valid chemical entity, as it is the only term in the paragraph that could potentially refer to a chemical. However, it is important to note that \"I/4e isopter\" is not a traditional chemical, but rather a standardized light stimulus used in visual field testing."}
