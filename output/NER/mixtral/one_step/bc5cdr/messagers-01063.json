The term \"cardiovascular disease\" is a condition or disorder, and \"dementia\" is a syndrome, so they do not clearly refer to a chemical. The term \"osteoporosis\" is a disease that is characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, and it can be treated with various medications, so it clearly refers to a chemical.
