However, \"olanzapine\" and \"risperidone\" are names of medications that are often used to treat certain medical conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These medications can have side effects, including weight gain, which is why they are mentioned in the context of body mass index (BMI) in the paragraph. Therefore, I have identified \"olanzapine\" and \"risperidone\" as the \"Disease\" entities in this case, even though they are not diseases themselves."},

The paragraph only discusses the body mass index (BMI) of individuals taking either olanzapine or risperidone, which are medications used to treat certain medical conditions. However, the text does not specify which diseases these medications are being used to treat. Therefore, I cannot provide a table of disease entities for this paragraph."}
