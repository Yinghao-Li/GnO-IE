Bradycardia refers to a heart rate that is lower than normal, which can be considered a disease or a medical condition. Therefore, I have identified \"bradycardia\" as the \"Disease\" entity in this paragraph."},

Therefore, the previously identified entity, \"bradycardia,\" remains the only valid \"Disease\" entity in this paragraph."}
