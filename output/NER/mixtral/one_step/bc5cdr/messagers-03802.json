Sustained ventricular tachycardia: It is a rapid heart rhythm that originates in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles).\n3. Acute myocardial infarction: It is the medical term for a heart attack, which occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot."},

Acute myocardial infarction: It is the medical term for a heart attack, which occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot.\n\nThe other two conditions mentioned in the paragraph, \"ventricular fibrillation\" and \"sustained ventricular tachycardia,\" are both heart rhythm disturbances, but they are not considered diseases in themselves. Instead, they are often symptoms or complications of underlying heart conditions or diseases. Therefore, they do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" and are not included in the table."}
