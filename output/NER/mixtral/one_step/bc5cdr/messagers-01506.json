It is named after Franz Nissl, who developed the technique in the late 19th century.\n2. \"calcium\" is a chemical element with the atomic number 20 and the symbol Ca. It is an essential nutrient for humans and other animals, and it plays a crucial role in many biological processes, including muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting.\n3. \"parvalbumin\" is a calcium-binding protein that is found in high concentrations in certain types of neurons in the brain. It is involved in regulating calcium levels in neurons and is often used as a marker for specific types of neurons in research."},
