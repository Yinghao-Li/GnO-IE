Instead, I have included \"acute cardiovascular complications\" as it is a general term that refers to a set of diseases or conditions that affect the cardiovascular system. However, I have kept \"toxic myocardial cell degeneration\" as it is a specific disease that refers to the degeneration of heart muscle cells due to toxins."}

The other entities, \"myocardial cell degeneration,\" \"acute cardiovascular complications,\" and \"diabetic patients,\" are medical conditions or descriptions of medical conditions, and do not clearly refer to chemicals."}
