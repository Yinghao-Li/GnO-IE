Isoprenaline: This is a medication used to treat bradycardia (a slow heart rate) and heart block (an obstruction in the heart's electrical pathways). It is a synthetic catecholamine, specifically a β-adrenergic agonist.\n2. ( - ) - propranolol: This is a medication used to treat various conditions such as hypertension, angina, irregular heartbeats, and essential tremors. It is a non-selective beta blocker, which means it blocks both β1 and β2 receptors.\n3. Circulating glucose: Glucose is a simple sugar that is a vital energy source for living organisms. Circulating glucose refers to the glucose present in the bloodstream.\n4. Lactate: Lactate is a chemical compound that is produced during anaerobic metabolism. It is a byproduct of the breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen.\n5. Free fatty acids: Free fatty acids are fatty acids that are not bound to proteins or other molecules. They are a significant energy source for the body and are released from adipose tissue during periods of fasting or exercise."},
