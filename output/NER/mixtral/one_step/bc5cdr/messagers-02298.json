Hypercalcemia is a condition in which the calcium level in the blood is above normal. It is not a disease itself but a symptom or a sign of other medical conditions. However, since the prompt asks for disease entities mentioned in the paragraph, I have listed hypercalcemia as the only valid entity."},
