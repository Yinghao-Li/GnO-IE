It is a condition characterized by a prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness between them. The term \"brain damage\" is not considered a disease in this context, but rather a consequence or result of the elevation of glutamatergic transmission and excitatory NMDA receptor-mediated mechanism."},
