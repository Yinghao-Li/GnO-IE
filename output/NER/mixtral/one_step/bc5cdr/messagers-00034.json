Allodynia refers to a condition where a person feels pain from stimuli that do not typically cause pain, while hyperalgesia is a condition where a person experiences heightened sensitivity to pain. These terms are used in the context of nociceptin-induced pain, and nocistatin's ability to block these pain sensations."},
