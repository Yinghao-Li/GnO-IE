Catalepsy is a condition characterized by a rigid, fixed posture and a decreased sensitivity to pain. In this case, it is induced by the drug haloperidol, which is used to treat various psychiatric disorders. Therefore, it is appropriate to identify \"haloperidol-induced catalepsy\" as a disease entity."},
