The term \"unresectable\" means that the tumor cannot be removed by surgery. Therefore, the exact phrase \"unresectable GBM\" is considered the disease entity."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| unresectable GBM |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only disease entity is \"unresectable GBM.\" The term \"patients\" refers to the individuals affected by the disease, not the disease itself. Therefore, \"patients\" is not considered a disease entity. The phrase \"one-third of the patients\" refers to the proportion of patients affected by the disease, so it is not a disease entity either. The term \"survival\" is a general concept related to health outcomes and not a specific disease. Therefore, it is not considered a disease entity."}

Therefore, there are no clear chemical entities in the given paragraph."}
