Sotalol-induced coronary spasm: This is a disease or condition where the coronary arteries go into spasm after taking the medication Sotalol.\n2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: This is a disease that affects the heart muscle, causing it to become enlarged and weakened, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood efficiently.\n3. Sustained ventricular tachycardia: This is a disease or condition where the heart beats abnormally fast in the lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart, which can lead to serious complications such as cardiac arrest."},

Therefore, it has been excluded from the list of disease entities."}
