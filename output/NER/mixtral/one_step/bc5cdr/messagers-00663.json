These terms are used in the context of lipophages and fat necrosis, indicating that they are being referred to as substances or materials rather than as general concepts. Therefore, it is appropriate to identify them as chemical entities."},

Therefore, the valid chemical entity in the paragraph is \"fat\"."}
