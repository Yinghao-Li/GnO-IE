The term \"this complication\" is not a clear disease entity, as it is a general term that could refer to any complication or problem. However, in this context, it is clear that \"this complication\" refers to \"bilateral abductor paralysis\", as it is the only condition mentioned in the paragraph. Nonetheless, to avoid any ambiguity, I have only included \"bilateral abductor paralysis\" in the table."}
