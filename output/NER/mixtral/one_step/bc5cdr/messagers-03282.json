It is a medical condition characterized by a prolonged period of time without breathing. The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"BCHE\" and \"point mutation (p. Val204Asp)\", refer to genetic variations or mutations, not diseases."},

It is a medical condition characterized by a prolonged period of time without breathing. The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"BCHE\" and \"point mutation (p. Val204Asp)\", do not clearly refer to diseases. BCHE is a gene that encodes the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase, and the point mutation (p. Val204Asp) is a genetic variation in this gene that can lead to a loss of activity and prolonged apnea with suxamethonium. However, these terms do not refer to diseases themselves."}

BCHE: Butyrylcholinesterase, also known as pseudocholinesterase or plasma cholinesterase, is an enzyme that breaks down certain chemicals in the body.\n2. p . Val204Asp: This is a point mutation, specifically a substitution of one amino acid (valine) for another (aspartic acid) at position 204 in the BCHE protein.\n3. suxamethonium: Also known as succinylcholine, this is a medication used to induce muscle relaxation during surgery or other medical procedures."},
