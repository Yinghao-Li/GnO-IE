These conditions include a reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma and the absence of minor fast-moving BChE components, specifically monomer, dimer, and monomer-albumin conjugate."},

The missing minor fast-moving BChE components are not considered diseases, but rather the absence of certain enzyme forms."}
