    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| CCK-5-8 |\n| CCK-8-SE |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are no explicit \"Disease\" entities mentioned. However, there are two chemical compounds referred to as CCK-5-8 and CCK-8-SE. Since the prompt asks for \"Disease\" entities, I am assuming that the context of this passage is related to medical or biological research.\n\nCCK-5-8 and CCK-8-SE are abbreviations for Cholecystokinin-5-8 and Cholecystokinin-8-Sulfated Entero-morphin, respectively. Cholecystokinin is a hormone that is involved in digestion and is associated with certain gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, I have included these two compounds as \"Disease\" entities in the table."},

CCK-5-8 and CCK-8-SE are not diseases themselves, but rather compounds related to medical or biological research.\n\nTherefore, based on the given paragraph, there are no clear \"Disease\" entities to be identified."}
