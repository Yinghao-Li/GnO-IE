Muscle fasciculations refer to sudden, involuntary contractions and relaxations of muscle fibers, which can be induced by the administration of suxamethonium, a type of muscle relaxant drug. Therefore, I have identified \"suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations\" as the disease entity in the paragraph."},

Although \"muscle fasciculations\" can be a symptom of various neuromuscular disorders, in this context, it is specifically referring to the fasciculations induced by the administration of suxamethonium. Therefore, I have identified \"suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations\" as the disease entity in the paragraph.\n\nThe other terms in the paragraph, such as \"Alfentanil\" and \"intragastric pressure,\" do not clearly refer to diseases and are therefore not included in the table."}
