It is a type of drug known as a beta-2 agonist, which works by relaxing muscles in the airways and increasing airflow to the lungs.\n2. beta - adrenoceptor: This is a type of receptor found in the body that is activated by the neurotransmitter adrenaline (epinephrine) and related hormones. Beta-adrenoceptors are found in various tissues, including the lungs, heart, and blood vessels, and play a role in regulating various physiological processes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and airway diameter."},

Therefore, it has been excluded from the table."}
