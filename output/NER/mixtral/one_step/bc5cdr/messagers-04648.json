Lithium carbonate is a naturally occurring chemical compound, while valproic acid is a synthetic chemical compound. Both of these chemicals have been shown to be effective in managing manic symptoms associated with stimulant use.\n\nHere are the chemical entities identified from the paragraph presented in a Markdown table:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| lithium carbonate |\n| valproic acid |\n| synthetic chemical compound |\n| naturally occurring chemical compound |"},
