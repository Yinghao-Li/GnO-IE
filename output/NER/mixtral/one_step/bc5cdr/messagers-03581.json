Isoproterenol is a medication used as a decongestant and a vasodilator. It is a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, which means it stimulates both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. It is used in the treatment of conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.\n\nIn this paragraph, isoproterenol is used in the context of a study on myocardial fibrosis, which is a condition characterized by the thickening and scarring of heart tissue. The study is a morphometric one, which means it involves the measurement of the size and shape of cells or tissues."},
