Catalepsy is a condition characterized by a rigid, inflexible state, usually of the limbs or trunk, which is sustained for a long period. It is mentioned as being enhanced by low doses of pilocarpine and induced by the dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol."},

In this case, the terms \"low doses of pilocarpine\" and \"the dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol\" are not diseases, so they should be removed. The only remaining disease-related entity is \"catalepsy,\" which is mentioned as being enhanced by low doses of pilocarpine and induced by the dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol."}
