The term \"peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha target gene activation\" is a biological process, not a disease."},

Peroxisome proliferator is a type of enzyme, and activated receptor - alpha is a type of protein, both of which are biological entities rather than chemical entities. Therefore, they are not included in the table."}
