In this paragraph, the phrase \"VCM-induced nephrotoxicity\" refers to the kidney damage caused by Vancomycin, which is a disease condition. Therefore, I identified \"VCM-induced nephrotoxicity\" as a disease entity."},

Therefore, I identified \"VCM-induced nephrotoxicity\" as a disease entity.\n* I did not include \"Erdosteine\" as a disease entity because it is a medication used to treat respiratory diseases, not a disease itself."}
