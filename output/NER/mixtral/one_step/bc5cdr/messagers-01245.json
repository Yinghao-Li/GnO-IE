It is a type of neurotransmitter, a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the brain and other areas of the body. The paragraph discusses the role of dopamine receptors and phasic dopamine signals in learning, and how tonic occupation of dopamine receptors can impair learning by competing with phasic dopamine signals. Therefore, \"dopamine\" is the only chemical entity in this paragraph."},
