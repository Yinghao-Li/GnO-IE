Its presence indicates that the virus is actively replicating.\n* anti - HBe: This is an abbreviation for antibodies to Hepatitis B e Antigen. The presence of these antibodies indicates that the individual has mounted an immune response to the hepatitis B virus and that the virus is no longer actively replicating.\n\nBoth HBeAg and anti-HBe are disease-related entities as they are directly related to Hepatitis B, which is a viral infection that affects the liver."},
