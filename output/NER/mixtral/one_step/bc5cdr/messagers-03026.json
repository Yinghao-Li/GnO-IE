Renal amyloidosis: A disease characterized by the buildup of an abnormal protein called amyloid in the kidneys, which can affect their function.\n2. SVC syndrome (Superior Vena Cava Syndrome): A group of symptoms caused by the blockage of the superior vena cava, usually due to a blood clot or a tumor.\n3. HITT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis): A rare but serious complication of heparin therapy, which can cause the formation of blood clots and a decrease in platelet count."},
