Catalepsy is a condition characterized by a lack of movement and a decreased sensitivity to pain, while neuroleptic-induced catalepsy is a form of catalepsy that is caused by the administration of neuroleptic drugs."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| catalepsy |\n\nExplanation:\n\nAfter reviewing the paragraph, the only clear disease entity is \"catalepsy\". The term \"neuroleptic-induced catalepsy\" is a specific form of catalepsy that is caused by neuroleptic drugs, but it is still a type of catalepsy. The term \"cholinergic systems\" and \"cholinergic mechanisms\" do not clearly refer to diseases, but rather to systems and mechanisms related to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine."}

Some examples of neuroleptics include haloperidol and chlorpromazine."},

Some examples of neuroleptics include haloperidol and chlorpromazine."}
