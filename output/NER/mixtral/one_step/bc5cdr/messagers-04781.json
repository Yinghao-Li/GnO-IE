This condition is associated with the administration of 17alpha - ethinylestradiol (EE) in rats, which also selectively inhibits the neutral pathway of bile salt (BS) synthesis."},

Therefore, they are not included in the table. The term \"intrahepatic cholestasis\" is a medical condition that refers to the impaired flow of bile from the liver to the small intestine, leading to the accumulation of bile in the liver."}
