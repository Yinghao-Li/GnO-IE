This is because the author suggests that this condition is likely due to the effects of lithium on the cAMP pathway and the expression of urea transporter (UT-A1) and water channel (AQP2) in the inner medulla. Therefore, the decreased capacity to concentrate urine is a pathological condition that is relevant to the discussion in the paragraph."},
