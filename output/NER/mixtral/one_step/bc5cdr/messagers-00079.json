Coronary artery disease: This is a condition where the blood vessels that supply the heart become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of cholesterol and fatty deposits, leading to a reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.\n2. Myocardial ischaemia: This is a condition characterized by an inadequate supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle, often due to the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries.\n3. Prolonged left ventricular dysfunction: This is a condition where the left ventricle of the heart, which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the rest of the body, does not function properly for an extended period, often due to damage from a heart attack or other heart conditions."},

Coronary artery disease: This is the only clear disease entity in the paragraph. It is a well-defined medical condition that affects the blood vessels that supply the heart.\n2. Myocardial ischaemia: This is also a clear disease entity in the paragraph. It is a condition characterized by an inadequate supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle.\n3. Prolonged left ventricular dysfunction: While this is a medical condition, it is not a disease in and of itself. Rather, it is a complication that can arise from various heart conditions, such as a heart attack or other forms of heart disease. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a disease entity in this context."}
