Cognitive deficits refer to the impairment in cognitive abilities such as learning, memory, perception, and reasoning. Streptozotocin is a chemical compound that is toxic to the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas and is often used in research to induce diabetes. However, in this context, it is being used to induce cognitive deficits in male Wistar rats."},

Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a disease entity."}
