Although CAA is not a disease in the traditional sense, it is an abbreviation for a condition called \"Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy,\" which is a disease that affects the blood vessels in the brain. Therefore, I have included CAA as a \"Disease\" entity in the table."},

Although the other entities mentioned, such as \"a loss in free intracellular thiols\" and \"an increase in necrosis markers,\" are medical conditions, they are not diseases themselves. Therefore, I have only included CAA as a \"Disease\" entity in the table."}
