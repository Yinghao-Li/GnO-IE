It is a chemical messenger that prepares the body for the \"fight or flight\" response.\n2. subtoxic bupivacaine: Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic and analgesic. Here, it is used with a prefix \"subtoxic\" which refers to a dose or level not high enough to cause death. So, subtoxic bupivacaine is a non-lethal dose of bupivacaine."},
