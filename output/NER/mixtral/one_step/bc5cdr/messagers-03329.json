Nephrotoxicity refers to the condition where the kidneys are damaged and cannot function properly due to exposure to certain toxins or drugs. The other terms in the paragraph, such as hemodynamic alterations, oxidative stress, mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and activity of respiratory complex I, are related to the mechanisms of the disease but are not diseases themselves."},

It has several medicinal properties.\n* Maleate: It is an organic salt of maleic acid, used as a food additive and also in the medical field.\n* Oxidative stress: It is a disturbance in the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and antioxidant defense systems.\n* Mitochondrial oxygen consumption: It is the process of consuming oxygen by mitochondria to generate energy in the form of ATP.\n* Activity of respiratory complex I: It is the first of five complexes involved in the electron transport chain, a process that generates energy in the form of ATP."},

Hemodynamic alterations refer to changes in the flow of blood in the body, oxidative stress is a condition characterized by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and the body's ability to detoxify or repair the resulting damage, mitochondrial oxygen consumption is a biological process, and activity of respiratory complex I is a biological process."}
