It is a condition in which a person's muscles stiffen and they become unable to move or speak. In this case, the text states that large doses of the cholinomimetic, pilocarpine, could induce catalepsy when peripheral cholinergic receptors were blocked."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| catalepsy |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The only term in the paragraph that clearly refers to a disease is \"catalepsy\". The other terms, \"cholinomimetic\" and \"pilocarpine\", refer to drugs or substances, not diseases. Similarly, \"peripheral cholinergic receptors\" refer to a type of receptor in the body, not a disease. Therefore, the only valid entity that can be classified as a disease is \"catalepsy\"."}
