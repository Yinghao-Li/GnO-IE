P - P interval: It is a term used in physiology and refers to the time interval between two consecutive R waves on an electrocardiogram (ECG), which represents the interval between two successive heartbeats.\n2. basic sinus cycle: It is a term used in physiology and refers to the normal rhythm of the heart, which is initiated by the sinoatrial node (SA node) and conducted through the atrioventricular node (AV node) to the ventricles.\n\nTherefore, these two terms are identified as chemical entities and presented in the table above."},
