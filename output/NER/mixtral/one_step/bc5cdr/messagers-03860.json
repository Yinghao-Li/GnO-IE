They can be a sign of kidney damage or disease.\n* APAP-induced nephrotoxicity: APAP is an abbreviation for acetaminophen, a common pain reliever and fever reducer. Nephrotoxicity refers to kidney damage or dysfunction. Therefore, APAP-induced nephrotoxicity refers to kidney damage caused by acetaminophen."},
