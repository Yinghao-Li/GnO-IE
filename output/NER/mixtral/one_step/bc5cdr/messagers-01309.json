Here, it is mentioned as a parent-rated symptom, which suggests that it is being assessed as part of a broader diagnostic or symptom-tracking tool.\n\n2. social withdrawal: This is another symptom that can be associated with various mental health conditions, such as depression or social anxiety disorder.\n\n3. emotional lability: This term refers to the tendency to experience rapid and unpredictable shifts in mood or affect. It can be a symptom of certain mental health disorders, such as bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder.\n\nNote that I did not include \"inattention\" as a disease entity, as it is not a disease itself but rather a symptom that can be associated with various conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)."},

However, in this context, they are being used as outcomes or measures that were assessed in the study. Therefore, I have included them as disease entities in the table, but it is important to note that they are not diseases themselves."}
