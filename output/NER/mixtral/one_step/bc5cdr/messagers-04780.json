EE is an abbreviation for a medical condition called \"Emergency Evacuation\" or \"Emergency Epidural\". However, in the context of this paragraph, it most likely refers to a drug called \"Ezetimibe and Esimerazole\" or \"Ezetimibe\", which are used to treat high cholesterol levels. Therefore, I have included \"EE\" as a disease entity in the table."},

The terms \"bile diversion\" and \"sterol 12alpha - hydroxylase\" and \"lithocholate 6beta - hydroxylase\" refer to medical procedures and enzymes, respectively, and not to diseases. Therefore, there are no valid disease entities to include in the table."}

It helps in the digestion of fats by emulsifying them.\n4. lithocholate 6beta - hydroxylase: Lithocholate 6beta - hydroxylase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of the lithocholate molecule at the 6beta position.\n5. EE: EE could be an abbreviation for a chemical compound, but without additional context, it is not possible to identify it precisely."},
