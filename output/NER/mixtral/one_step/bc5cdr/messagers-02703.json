However, there are two substances mentioned, CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365,260 and CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718, which are related to the treatment of a condition caused by Cholecystokinin (CCK) hormone. CCK-8 is a type of CCK that is known to cause certain effects, and the antagonists are used to reverse those effects. Therefore, I have identified \"CCK-8\" as the disease entity in this paragraph."},
