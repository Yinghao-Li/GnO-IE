While these are not diseases themselves, they are often used in medical research related to diseases, especially in the field of oncology. Therefore, I have included them as \"Disease\" entities in this table."},

The cells mentioned, HL60 and HBMP, are not diseases themselves, but rather cell lines used in medical research. Therefore, there are no valid \"Disease\" entities to present in a table."}
