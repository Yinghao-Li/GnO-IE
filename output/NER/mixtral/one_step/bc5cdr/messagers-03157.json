Flutamide: It is an antiandrogen medication used to treat prostate cancer.\n2. Letrozole: It is an aromatase inhibitor used in the treatment of breast cancer.\n3. Tamoxifen: It is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used to prevent breast cancer in high-risk patients and treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women.\n4. Testosterone: It is a steroid hormone that plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues and secondary sexual characteristics.\n5.
