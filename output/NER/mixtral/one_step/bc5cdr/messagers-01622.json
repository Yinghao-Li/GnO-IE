The term \"retrograde dye\" is a general category of substances used for tracing neural pathways, but \"Fastblue\" is a specific chemical name within that category. The other terms in the paragraph, such as \"tracing techniques,\" \"presumptive bladder afferent cells,\" \"lumbosacral,\" and \"DRG\" do not refer to chemical entities."}
