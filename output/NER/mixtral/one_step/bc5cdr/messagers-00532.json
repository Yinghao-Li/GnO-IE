However, there is a reference to \"cocaine-induced locomotor activity.\" Although it is not a typical disease, it is still considered a disorder or an abnormal condition in animals, often used in research related to substance use and addiction. Therefore, I have identified \"cocaine-induced locomotor activity\" as a Disease entity."},

Therefore, I have kept it as a Disease entity and presented it in a Markdown table."}
