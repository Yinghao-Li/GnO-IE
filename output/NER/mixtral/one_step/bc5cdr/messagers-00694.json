However, there is a reference to a \"glutamate / N - methyl - D - aspartate antagonist,\" which is a type of pharmacological agent used to block the actions of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the related compound N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) at their receptor sites. These agents are used in the treatment of various neurological conditions, such as epilepsy, stroke, and chronic pain, but they are not diseases themselves. Therefore, I have included this term in the table as it is the only potentially relevant entity in the context of the paragraph."},
