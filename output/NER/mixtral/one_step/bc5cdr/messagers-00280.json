The term \"APD\" stands for Action Potential Duration, which is a measurement in cardiology, and \"TDR\" stands for Transmural Dispersion of Repolarization, another measurement in cardiology. Neither of these is a disease. Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"dl - sotalol.\""},

Epicardial APD (Action Potential Duration) is a measurement of the time it takes for an action potential to propagate through the epicardial layer of the heart, and TDR (Transmural Dispersion of Repolarization) is a measurement of the difference in action potential duration between the epicardial and endocardial layers of the heart. These are not chemicals, but rather measurements or properties related to the heart's electrical activity."}
