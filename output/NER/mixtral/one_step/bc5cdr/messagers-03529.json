Hypertrophy refers to the enlargement of an organ or tissue due to the increase in the size of its cells. In this context, it is being used to describe a medical condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively. Therefore, \"hypertrophied rat heart\" is identified as a disease entity."},
