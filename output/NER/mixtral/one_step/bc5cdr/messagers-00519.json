NADH - dehydrogenase: This is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in energy production and is composed of several coenzymes, including NADH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide)."},

Mitochondrial calcium refers to calcium ions in the context of mitochondria, and NADH - dehydrogenase is an enzyme complex. Therefore, they do not meet the strict criteria for being considered chemical entities."}
