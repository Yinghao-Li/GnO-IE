Mesangial dysfunction: This term refers to a disorder or abnormality in the mesangial region of the kidney's glomerulus, which can affect kidney function.\n2. Glomerular sclerosis: This term refers to the scarring or hardening of the glomeruli in the kidney, which can impair kidney function and potentially lead to kidney failure.\n3. Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) model: While not a disease itself, this term refers to a laboratory model used to study the effects of puromycin aminonucleoside on the kidney, often used to investigate the mechanisms of glomerular injury and sclerosis."},
