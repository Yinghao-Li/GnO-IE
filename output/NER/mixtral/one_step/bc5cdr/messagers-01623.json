The other terms such as \"bladder afferent cells in DRG\" and \"p75 (NTR) - IR\" do not clearly refer to diseases, so they are not included in the table. \"Bladder afferent cells in DRG\" refers to specific types of cells in the body, while \"p75 (NTR) - IR\" likely refers to a specific protein or receptor. Therefore, the Markdown table above contains one column named \"Disease\" with the single entry \"cystitis\"."}
