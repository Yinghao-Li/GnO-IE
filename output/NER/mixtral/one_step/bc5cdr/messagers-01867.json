It is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and the body's ability to detoxify these reactive products. This imbalance can lead to damage to cells and tissues, which is why it is considered a stress or a diseased state."},

The term \"GSSG\" refers to glutathione disulfide, which is a byproduct of the antioxidant defense system in the body. It is not a disease itself, but rather an indicator of the body's response to oxidative stress. Similarly, \"hepatic tissue\" and \"hepatocytes\" are types of liver tissue and cells, respectively, and are not diseases. Therefore, they are not included in the table."}
