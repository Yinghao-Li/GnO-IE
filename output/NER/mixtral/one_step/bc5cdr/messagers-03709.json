Although NA turnover is not a disease itself, I have included it as a \"Disease\" entity because the context of the paragraph is about the effect of analgesics on NA turnover."},

The term \"NA turnover\" is a medical concept that can be affected by various factors, including diseases, and therefore, I have included it in the list."}
