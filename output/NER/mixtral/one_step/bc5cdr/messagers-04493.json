The term \"myocardial ischemia\" is the only clear mention of a disease in the paragraph. Therefore, the Markdown table still contains one row with the column name \"Disease\" and the value \"myocardial ischemia.\"\n\nThe other terms in the paragraph, such as \"CD - 832\" and \"stenosis,\" do not clearly refer to diseases, so they are not included in the table."}
