It compares the mean plasma lidocaine level in patients who are on beta-blocking agents to those who are not. Beta-blocking agents are a type of medication used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, heart failure, and abnormal heart rhythms, but they are not a disease. Therefore, there are no clear disease entities to extract from the paragraph."}

Instead, they refer to a class of chemicals with similar pharmacological effects. Therefore, they do not meet the criteria for a chemical entity in this context."}
