The term \"toxicity\" is the only disease-related entity in the paragraph, as it refers to an adverse effect or condition that may occur due to the interaction between flecainide and certain CYP2D6 inhibitors. Therefore, I have included \"toxicity\" as the valid disease entity in the Markdown table."}
