    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| isoproterenol |\n\nIn the given paragraph, the term \"isoproterenol\" is the only one that can be identified as a disease entity. Isoproterenol is a medication used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate) and heart block (interference with the normal conduction of electrical impulses through the heart). However, it can also have negative effects on the heart, such as increasing the risk of heart attack and heart failure, which is why it is mentioned in the context of a \"disease\" in this paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| isoproterenol |\n\nIn the given paragraph, the term \"isoproterenol\" is the only one that can be identified as a disease entity. The other terms mentioned, such as \"T . chebula extract\" and \"lipid peroxide formation,\" are not diseases, but rather substances or processes related to the study or experiment being described. Therefore, only \"isoproterenol\" is included in the table as a disease entity."}
