Therefore, \"hepatitis B\" is the valid disease entity in this paragraph. The term \"hepatitis B virus\" is a specific virus that causes the disease \"hepatitis B\", and not a disease itself, but I included it in the previous answer to make it clear what disease the entity referred to. However, to follow the instructions more precisely, I have revised the answer to only include \"hepatitis B\" as the valid disease entity."}
