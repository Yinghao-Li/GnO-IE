However, it is worth noting that some of these terms can also be considered as a symptom or a complication of other diseases. For example, cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension are often complications of other medical conditions, such as brain injury or infection. Similarly, fulminant hepatic failure is a severe form of liver failure that can be caused by various factors, such as viral hepatitis or drug toxicity."},

The remaining three terms are all medical conditions that can affect human health."}

Hypothermia: While not a chemical in the traditional sense, hypothermia is a condition related to body temperature and can be considered a chemical entity in a biomedical context.\n2. Cerebral edema: This is a medical condition characterized by an excess accumulation of fluid in the brain, leading to swelling.\n3. Intracranial hypertension: This is a medical condition characterized by increased pressure within the skull.\n4. Fulminant hepatic failure: This is a severe liver failure that occurs suddenly and can be life-threatening. It is not a chemical, but a medical condition, but I have included it as it is directly related to the context of the paragraph."},
