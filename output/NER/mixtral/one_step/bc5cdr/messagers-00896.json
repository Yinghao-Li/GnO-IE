Mitochondrial oxidative damage is caused by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria, while nitrative damage is caused by the addition of a nitro group (-NO2) to proteins, lipids, or other molecules. These chemical entities are important in understanding the sequence of events in cellular damage and the potential role of mitochondria in disease processes."},
