In this context, it is referred to as being present in the plasma, which is the liquid component of blood.\n2. \"systemic vascular resistance\": While not a chemical itself, systemic vascular resistance is a measurement of the resistance that the body's blood vessels provide against the flow of blood. It is influenced by various factors, including the diameter and length of the blood vessels, as well as the viscosity of the blood."},
