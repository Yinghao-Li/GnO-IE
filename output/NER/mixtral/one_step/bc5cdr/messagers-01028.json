An analgesic is a type of medication that is used to relieve pain. It is not a disease itself, but it is related to the treatment of diseases or conditions that cause pain. However, since the prompt asks for the identification of disease entities, I have included \"analgesic\" in the table."},

The paragraph discusses the use of analgesics, which are medications used to relieve pain, but it does not specify any particular disease or condition that the analgesics are being used to treat. Therefore, there are no disease entities to present in a table."}

The other terms in the paragraph, such as \"odds ratio,\" \"95% CI,\" and \"0.89 - 1.66,\" are statistical terms and do not refer to any chemical entities."},
