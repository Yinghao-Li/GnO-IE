However, \"ecstasy\" is referred to, which is a slang term for a drug called MDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Although MDMA is not a disease itself, its prolonged use can lead to various health issues, including psychological and neurological disorders. Therefore, I have included \"ecstasy\" as a disease entity in this case, understanding that it is a substance use disorder."},
