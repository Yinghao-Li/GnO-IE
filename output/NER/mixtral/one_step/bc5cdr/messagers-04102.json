A tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic muscle contraction and relaxation that causes a shaking movement. It is a symptom of various diseases or disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or essential tremor. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific disease associated with the tremor."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| tremor |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised request, I understand that I should only present the entities that unambiguously refer to diseases. In this context, \"tremor\" is the only term that can be considered a disease entity, even though it is more accurately described as a symptom or a manifestation of various neurological conditions. The term \"substances\" does not refer to a disease, and the phrase \"therapeutic doses\" implies a medical context but does not directly name a specific disease."}
