Nifedipine is a type of drug that belongs to a class of drugs called calcium channel blockers. It is used to treat high blood pressure, angina (chest pain), and certain heart rhythm disorders. Therefore, it is identified as a chemical entity and presented in the table above."},

The term \"tachycardia\" is a medical condition that refers to a heart rate that is faster than normal. It is not a chemical entity, so it is not included in the table. Similarly, the term \"hearts\" refers to an organ in the body, not a chemical, so it is not included in the table. The term \"normally innervated\" refers to the normal supply of nerves to an organ or body part, which is not a chemical entity and is not included in the table. Therefore, only the term \"nifedipine\" is presented in the table above."}
