Appetite suppressants: These are drugs that reduce hunger and promote a feeling of fullness, which can lead to weight loss. They are often used in the treatment of obesity.\n\n2. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH): This is a rare, progressive lung disorder in which the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs become narrowed, making it harder for the heart to pump blood through the lungs. It is also known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)."},
