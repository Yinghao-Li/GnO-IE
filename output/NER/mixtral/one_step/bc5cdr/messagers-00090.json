In this context, it is used to describe the reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, which is a symptom of coronary artery disease. Therefore, it is not included in the table. Similarly, \"exercise\" is not a disease entity, but rather an activity that can trigger ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, it is not included in the table."}
