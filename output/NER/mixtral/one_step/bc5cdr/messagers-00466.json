Persistent sterile leukocyturia: This term refers to a condition where white blood cells are present in the urine without any evidence of infection. It is considered a disease as it is a symptom or sign of an underlying medical condition.\n2. mild increase in the urine albumin / creatinine ratio: Although this is not a disease per se, it is a medical condition that can indicate kidney damage or disease.\n3. microscopic hematuria: This term refers to the presence of red blood cells in the urine that can only be detected under a microscope. It is considered a disease as it can be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as a kidney or bladder problem."},

It is not a disease itself, but rather a symptom or sign of an underlying medical condition. Therefore, it was not included in the final table."}
