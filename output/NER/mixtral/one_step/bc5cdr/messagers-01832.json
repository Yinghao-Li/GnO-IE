Although it is not a disease itself, it is closely related to the management of a medical condition, specifically coagulation disorders. Therefore, I have included it in the table as a \"Disease\" entity."},

However, in the given paragraph, there are no explicit disease names mentioned. The term \"International Normalized Ratio\" is a laboratory value used to monitor the effect of anticoagulant therapy, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, I have only included it in the table as a \"Disease\" entity due to its close relation to coagulation disorders."}

International Normalized Ratio (INR): It is a standardized way of reporting the result of a blood test to measure the clotting time of blood, specifically for patients taking anticoagulants such as warfarin.\n3. Warfarin: It is an anticoagulant medication used to prevent blood clots in the veins, arteries, and heart.\n\nAll three entities are mentioned in the paragraph and are related to anticoagulant medications and blood clotting."},
