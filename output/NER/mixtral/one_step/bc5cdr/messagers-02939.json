LVEF decline: LVEF stands for Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, which is a measure of the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently. A decline in LVEF is indicative of heart failure or other heart diseases."},

A decline in LVEF is indicative of heart failure or other heart diseases.\n\nThe other term, myocardial contrast enhancement, is not a disease itself, but rather a medical procedure or imaging technique. Therefore, it was not included in the final list."}
