Gentamicin: It is an antibiotic drug used to treat various types of bacterial infections.\n2. Na ( + ): It represents the Sodium ion.\n3. K ( + ): It represents the Potassium ion.\n4. ATPase: It is an enzyme that combines ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and a cation (like Na+ or H+) to create a concentration gradient.\n5. NHE3: It stands for Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 3, a protein that regulates pH and sodium levels in the kidney.\n6. NBC1: It stands for Sodium-Bicarbonate Cotransporter 1, a protein that regulates bicarbonate levels in the kidney.\n7. AQP1: It stands for Aquaporin 1, a protein that regulates water transport in the kidney.\n8. OAT: It stands for Organic Anion Transporter, a protein that regulates the transport of organic anions in the kidney."},
