    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| None |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph does not mention any specific diseases. It discusses the process of performing a dose-response curve (DRC) and measuring various responses such as airway responses (FEV1, FEF25-75), heart rate (HR), tremor, and metabolic responses (K, Glu) at different dosage levels. However, there is no mention of any specific diseases."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| None |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph still does not mention any specific diseases. The terms \"airway responses\" and \"metabolic responses\" are general medical terms that do not refer to specific diseases. Therefore, there are still no valid disease entities to present in the table."}
