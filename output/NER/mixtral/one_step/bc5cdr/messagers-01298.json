It is a medication used to treat certain stomach or urinary conditions and also used to induce experimental status epilepticus in animal models of epilepsy. Therefore, it is identified as a chemical and presented in the table."},

In the original paragraph, there were no other entities that could be considered as chemical entities. Therefore, the table remains the same with only one entry for the chemical \"pilocarpine\"."}
