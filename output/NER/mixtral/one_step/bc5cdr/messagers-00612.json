These entities are mentioned in the context of their effects on the body and are therefore considered chemical entities."},

Therefore, both of these entities are clearly chemical in nature.\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"animals\", \"ventilation\", and \"centrally determined\", do not refer to chemical entities and have been excluded from the list."}
