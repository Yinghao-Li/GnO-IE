The other terms, such as \"protection,\" \"overexpression of superoxide dismutase,\" \"hypothesis,\" \"oxidant stress,\" and \"aminoglycoside-induced\" do not clearly refer to diseases. Therefore, the table above contains the sole valid disease entity, \"ototoxicity,\" presented precisely as in the original paragraph."}
