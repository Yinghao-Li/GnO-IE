The other terms, \"Paclitaxel\" and \"5-fluorouracil,\" are actually drugs or chemotherapeutic agents used to treat various types of cancer. Therefore, they do not meet the criteria for being a disease entity. After removing these non-disease entities, we are left with only one disease entity, which is \"MCF-7 cell lines.\""}
