However, since it is specifically referred to as \"coronary\" CTA, I have listed it as a separate entity to highlight the distinction from a regular CTA.\n2. \"serial markers\" are a type of medical measurement, likely referring to cardiac biomarkers that are measured over time to assess heart function.\n3. \"cardiac marker measurements\" are a type of medical measurement, likely referring to the quantification of cardiac biomarkers to assess heart function."},
