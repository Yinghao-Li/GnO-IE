It is a collective term for highly reactive chemicals containing oxygen. Since it is a well-defined chemical or chemical class, it is a valid chemical entity. The other term, \"mitochondria,\" is an organelle in a cell and not a chemical, so it is not included in the table."},

Therefore, I have removed \"interfibrillar mitochondria\" from the list, as it is not a chemical entity. \"ROS\" (Reactive Oxygen Species) remains the only valid chemical entity in the paragraph."}
