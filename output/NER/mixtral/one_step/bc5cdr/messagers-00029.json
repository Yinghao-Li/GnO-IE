Quinine-sensitive channels are a type of potassium channel that can be affected by the drug quinine, while 4 - aminopyridine-sensitive K(+)-channels are a type of potassium channel that can be affected by the drug 4 - aminopyridine. These channels are mentioned in the context of morphine reward, suggesting that they may play a role in the rewarding effects of this drug."},

The terms \"quinine-sensitive\" and \"4 - aminopyridine-sensitive K(+)-channels\" refer to specific types of ion channels that can be affected by certain substances, rather than diseases. Therefore, there are no disease entities to present in a table."}
