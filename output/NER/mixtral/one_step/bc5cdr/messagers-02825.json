The phrase \"dexamethasone-induced hypertension\" indicates that the high blood pressure is a result of dexamethasone administration."},

The term \"antioxidant effects\" refers to a property or characteristic, not a disease. Similarly, \"bovine lactoferrin\" is a protein, and \"rat\" is an animal model used in the study, neither of which are diseases."}
