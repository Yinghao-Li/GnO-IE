Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP): This is a chemical compound that acts as a neurotransmitter and a hormone. It is a polypeptide consisting of 28 amino acids.\n2. positive inotropic properties: While not a specific chemical, this term refers to the ability of a substance to increase the force of heart muscle contractions. It is included here because it is a characteristic of certain chemicals, such as some drugs used to treat heart failure."},
