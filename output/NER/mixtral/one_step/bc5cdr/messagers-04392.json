    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Pulmonary edema |\n| Shock |\n| High-dose aracytine-C for lymphoma |\n| TNF-alpha |\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Pulmonary edema: A condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lungs.\n2. Shock: A serious condition characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure and may lead to inadequate blood flow to the organs.\n3. High-dose aracytine-C for lymphoma: Aracytine is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including lymphoma. Here, it is mentioned in the context of a high-dose treatment.\n4. TNF-alpha: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine involved in the inflammatory response and has been implicated in various diseases.\n\nNote: I assumed \"aracytine-C\" is a typo and should be \"cytarabine\" (also known as Ara-C), a chemotherapy drug. However, I left it as is in the table since the goal is to identify the entities precisely as they appear in the original paragraph."},

Aracytine-C is a chemotherapy drug, and TNF-alpha is a cytokine involved in the inflammatory response."}
