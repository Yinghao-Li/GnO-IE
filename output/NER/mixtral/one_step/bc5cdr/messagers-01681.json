The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"sural nerve sensory action potential (SAP)\" and \"refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE)\", do not refer to chemicals. \"Sural nerve\" is a type of nerve, \"sensory action potential (SAP)\" is a measurement of nerve function, and \"refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE)\" is a medical condition. Therefore, these terms do not meet the criteria for being considered chemical entities."}
