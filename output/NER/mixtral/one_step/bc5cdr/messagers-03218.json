CsA: It is a well-known chemical, which is an abbreviation for Cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressant drug.\n2. TGF - b: It is a chemical compound, which stands for Transforming Growth Factor-beta, a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation.\n3. IL - 7: It is a chemical compound, which stands for Interleukin-7, a cytokine that plays a vital role in the immune system.\n4. TBARs: It is a chemical compound, which stands for Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances, a group of compounds used as a marker for lipid peroxidation.\n5. mTOR: It is a chemical compound, which stands for mammalian Target of Rapamycin, a protein kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism."},

It is a term used to describe the liquid part of the blood that remains after clotting and is often used to describe the source of a chemical compound, in this case, TGF-b and IL-7. Similarly, \"kidney\" was not included as it is an organ and not a chemical."}
