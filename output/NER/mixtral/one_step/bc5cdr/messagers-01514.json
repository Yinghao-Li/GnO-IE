The term \"lesion\" refers to an abnormal change in the body, often associated with disease or injury. In this context, the \"massive lesion\" is the disease entity being described."}

The terms \"glial\" and \"neuronal\" are biological terms that refer to types of cells in the nervous system, and therefore do not qualify as chemical entities."}
