It is a syndrome characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram, which can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities. The phrase \"drug-induced\" indicates that the syndrome is caused by a medication, making it a specific medical condition."},
