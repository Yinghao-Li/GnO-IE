However, there is a reference to \"amphetamine-induced stereotypies.\" While stereotypies are not a disease themselves, they can be a symptom or manifestation of certain medical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and drug-induced states. Since the paragraph specifically mentions \"amphetamine-induced stereotypies,\" it is reasonable to include this term as a disease entity for the purpose of this exercise."},

Since the paragraph specifically mentions \"amphetamine-induced stereotypies,\" it is reasonable to include this term as a disease entity for the purpose of this exercise.\n\nThe other term mentioned in the paragraph, \"DSP4,\" is not a disease entity. It is a neurotoxin that selectively damages noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and is used in research to study the effects of noradrenergic deafferentation. Therefore, it should not be included in the list of disease entities."}
