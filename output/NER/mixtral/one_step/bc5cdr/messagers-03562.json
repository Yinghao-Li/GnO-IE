However, there is a reference to a \"cholinergic - opioid interaction.\" While this is not a disease itself, it could be related to certain medical conditions or diseases involving the nervous system, where cholinergic and opioid systems interact. Nonetheless, since the paragraph does not explicitly mention any diseases, the table above lists the \"cholinergic - opioid interaction\" as the only identifiable entity."},

Therefore, there are no valid disease entities to present in a table."}
