However, it is not a disease in the traditional sense. The phrase describes the physiological characteristics of the heart muscle (myocardium) that are affected by barium exposure. I have included it as a single entity because it is unclear from the context whether the individual components (excitability, contractility, and metabolic characteristics) are affected separately or as a whole."},
