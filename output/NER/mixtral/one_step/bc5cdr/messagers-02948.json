These specific weights are 10 g, 15 g, 60 g, and 100 g. However, the term \"gauges\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a unit of measurement for the thickness or diameter of the von Frey filaments. Therefore, the table above lists only the weights as the chemical entities found in the paragraph."}
