Flurothyl is a chemical that is used to induce seizures in experimental animals, and seizures are a symptom of various neurological disorders, so it can be considered a disease entity.\n\nThe term \"MSG\" (monosodium glutamate) is a food additive and is not a disease entity. Similarly, \"neonatally\" refers to the time of treatment and is not a disease. The term \"seizure thresholds\" refers to the minimum amount of Flurothyl required to induce seizures and is not a disease entity. The term \"flurothyl seizure testing\" refers to the experimental procedure used to evaluate the effects of MSG on seizure thresholds and is not a disease entity."},
