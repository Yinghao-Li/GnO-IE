However, there are no specific diseases mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nHypoalbuminemia and heavy proteinuria are medical conditions, but they are not diseases in themselves.

I analyzed the given paragraph and found two words that can be identified as \"Chemical\" entities.\n2. The words are \"hypoalbuminemia\" and \"proteinuria\".\n3. \"Hypoalbuminemia\" refers to a medical condition characterized by low levels of albumin in the blood.\n4. \"Proteinuria\" is a medical condition where an excessive amount of protein is present in the urine.\n5. I have presented these entities in a Markdown table with one column named \"Chemical\".\n6. The entities are presented precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},

I reviewed the previously identified entities and removed any that do not clearly refer to \"Chemical\" entities.\n2. The word \"diuretic\" is a type of medication that increases urine production, but it is not a chemical entity.\n3. The remaining entities are \"hypoalbuminemia\" and \"proteinuria\", which are medical conditions related to the levels of certain chemicals in the body.\n4. I have presented these entities in a Markdown table with one column named \"Chemical\".\n5. The entities are presented precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."}
