In the original paragraph, there is only one chemical entity mentioned, which is \"cocaine\". Therefore, the table above contains one row with the chemical name \"cocaine\" in the \"Chemical\" column. The other entities in the paragraph, such as \"coronary CTA\" and \"chest pain\", are medical terms that do not clearly refer to chemicals, so they are not included in the table."}
