Memory deficit is a common symptom of various neurological disorders.\n* STZ (ICV; 3mg/Kg) is also identified as a disease entity because it is a drug (Streptozotocin) that is known to induce diabetes when administered in a certain way (ICV - Intracerebroventricular). It is possible that the memory deficit observed in the experiment is a result of the STZ administration."},
