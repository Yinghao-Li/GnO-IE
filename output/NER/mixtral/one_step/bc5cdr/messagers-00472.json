Albumin is a protein found in the blood that can pass through damaged kidneys into the urine, while creatinine is a waste product that's produced by normal muscle breakdown and is excreted by the kidneys.\n4. creatinine: This is repeated from the first bullet point, but it is mentioned again in the paragraph, so I included it as a separate entity."},
