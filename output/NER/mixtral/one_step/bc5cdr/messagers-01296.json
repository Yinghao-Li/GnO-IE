Seizures are abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can cause a wide range of symptoms, from brief lapses in attention to convulsions and loss of consciousness. Status epilepticus is a condition in which seizures last for a prolonged period of time or occur in a repeated, continuous manner, and it can be a medical emergency."},
