It is possible that the author is using the term \"therapy\" to refer to a medical treatment for a specific disease or condition, but the text does not provide enough information to determine what that disease or condition might be. Therefore, I have included \"daptomycin therapy\" in the table as it is the only possible entity that could be related to a disease or medical condition."}
