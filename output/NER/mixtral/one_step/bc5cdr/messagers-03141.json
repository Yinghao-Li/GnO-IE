An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart, and in this case, it revealed a heart rate of 37 beats per minute, which is slower than the normal resting heart rate for adults (usually between 60-100 beats per minute). This slower-than-normal heart rate is referred to as \"sinus bradycardia\"."},
