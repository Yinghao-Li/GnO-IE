The phrase \"drugs\" is not a chemical entity because it is a general term that can refer to a wide variety of substances, including both chemicals and non-chemicals. In this case, \"drugs\" is used as a general term to refer to medications that may contain vitamin A, so it does not refer to a specific chemical entity."}
