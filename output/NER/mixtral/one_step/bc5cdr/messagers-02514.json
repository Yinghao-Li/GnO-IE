METH: METH is an abbreviation for Methamphetamine, which is a chemical compound.\n\nThe other term \"frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic homoeostasis\" is a complex term that refers to the balance or equilibrium of dopamine and serotonin in the frontostriatal region of the brain. While dopamine and serotonin are chemical messengers in the brain, the term \"frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic homoeostasis\" is a concept that refers to the balance of these neurotransmitters in a specific region of the brain, rather than a specific chemical entity. Therefore, it does not clearly refer to a \"Chemical\" and should not be included in the list of chemical entities."}
