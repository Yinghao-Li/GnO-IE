    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| STZ induced glial activation |\n| apoptotic cell death |\n| post synaptic neurotoxicity |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* STZ (Streptozotocin) induced glial activation: STZ is a chemical agent that is used to induce diabetes in experimental animals. The activation of glial cells is a response to the damage caused by STZ.\n* apoptotic cell death: Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the death of brain cells.\n* post synaptic neurotoxicity: Neurotoxicity refers to damage to the nervous system. In this case, it specifically refers to damage to the post-synaptic region of the neuron, which is the part of the neuron that receives signals from other neurons."},
