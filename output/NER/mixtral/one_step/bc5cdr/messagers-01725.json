The improved glomerular filtration rate, ameliorated glomerulosclerosis, and decreased proteinuria are not chemical entities but rather the effects of losartan treatment."},

The other terms such as glomerular filtration rate, glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria are medical conditions or physiological processes, not chemical entities. Therefore, the table only includes 'losartan' as the valid chemical entity."}
