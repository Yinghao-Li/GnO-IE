The first one, \"optic neuropathy,\" is a condition that affects the optic nerve, while the second one, \"axonal polyneuropathy,\" is a condition that affects the peripheral nerves. Both of these conditions are related to the nervous system and can have serious consequences if not treated promptly."},

The term \"Ethambutol\" is a drug and not a disease, so it is not included in the table. The other terms in the paragraph are related to the diseases or their symptoms, but they do not refer to diseases themselves. Therefore, they are not included in the table.\n\nTo clarify, the table includes only the two diseases mentioned in the paragraph, and no other entities."}
