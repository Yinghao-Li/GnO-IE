It is mentioned as the substance that five male Wistar rats received through repeated subcutaneous injections. Although PAN is an abbreviation, it is mentioned as a substance that is being injected, and it is not clear what it stands for from the context. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that PAN is a disease entity in this context."},

The other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"male\", \"Wistar rats\", \"subcutaneous\", and \"saline\" do not refer to diseases. Therefore, the valid disease entity is \"PAN\", which is presented in the table above."}

It is mentioned as being injected into five male Wistar rats. The other substance mentioned, \"saline\", is a solution that is primarily water and may not be considered a chemical in the same sense as PAN. Therefore, only \"PAN\" is included in the table as a chemical entity."},

In the original paragraph, only one substance was mentioned that can be classified as a \"chemical\", which is \"PAN\". Therefore, the table still only includes \"PAN\" as a chemical entity. The other substance mentioned, \"saline\", is a solution that is primarily water and may not be considered a chemical in the same sense as PAN. Therefore, it is not included in the table."}
