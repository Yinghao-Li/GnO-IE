Angioedema is a similar condition but it occurs deeper in the skin, often around the eyes and lips, and can cause severe swelling. Both urticaria and angioedema can be caused by allergic reactions."},

Erythema is a symptom of inflammation, and rush is a symptom of an allergic reaction. They are not chemicals themselves, but rather, they are conditions caused by chemicals or other substances."}
