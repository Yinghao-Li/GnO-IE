These are a type of receptor that binds to specific ligands, such as neurotransmitters or hormones, and triggers a response in the body. In this case, the specific type of receptor is \"beta 2\", which is a subtype of beta receptors that are activated by catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline."},

The other terms such as \"physiologic\" and \"pathologic\" are not chemical entities, but rather they are related to the study of the functions and abnormalities of living organisms, respectively. Therefore, they should not be included in the table of chemical entities."}
