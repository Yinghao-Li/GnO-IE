    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Controlled hypotension anesthesia |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, there is only one disease entity mentioned, which is \"Controlled hypotension anesthesia.\" It is a medical condition where the blood pressure is deliberately lowered during surgery to reduce bleeding. The other medical terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"intraoperative bleeding,\" \"intraoperative blood pressure,\" and \"propofol-remifentanil total i.v. anesthesia,\" are not considered diseases."},

I have removed any ambiguous entities and provided a table with the valid disease entity."}
