Fibrosis refers to the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ, which can be caused by various factors, including chemical exposure or injury. Hepatocellular regeneration is the process of liver cells (hepatocytes) regenerating and repairing damaged liver tissue, which can also be influenced by chemical agents."},

Therefore, I have removed it from the list."}
