However, since the original paragraph does not provide enough context to determine if prostaglandin synthesis is mentioned in the context of a specific disease, I have included it as a \"Disease\" entity."}

Prostaglandins are naturally occurring lipid compounds that have diverse hormone-like effects in animals. They are derived from fatty acids and are not consumed or produced in a laboratory setting in this context, but they are still considered a chemical. Therefore, the valid entity is \"prostaglandin.\""},

The term \"corticomedullary gradient\" refers to a spatial distribution or pattern of prostaglandin synthesis and does not directly refer to a specific chemical. Therefore, the valid entity is \"prostaglandin.\""}
