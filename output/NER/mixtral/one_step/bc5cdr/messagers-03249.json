Although \"neuromuscular\" in itself is a term related to the nervous and muscular systems, it is often used in the context of diseases or conditions affecting these systems. Here, it is used in the context of monitoring the neuromuscular function, which can be associated with various neuromuscular disorders or diseases."},
