Tachycardia refers to a rapid heart rate, usually over 100 beats per minute. It is listed as a side effect of i.c. carbachol injection, and propranolol is mentioned to inhibit this specific effect."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| tachycardia |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised request, I have carefully reviewed the paragraph again and confirmed that \"tachycardia\" is the only disease entity mentioned. The other terms in the paragraph refer to drugs, treatments, or measurement units, and not diseases. Therefore, the updated table only contains \"tachycardia\" as the valid disease entity."}
