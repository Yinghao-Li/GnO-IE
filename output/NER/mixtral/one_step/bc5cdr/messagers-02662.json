It is important to note that the context in which these terms are used may affect their classification. For example, \"cardiac disarrangement\" and \"necrosis\" are generally considered biological processes or conditions, not chemicals. Similarly, \"TAP\" is typically an abbreviation for a biological process (tetrapyrrole anabolic pathway), but it is unclear from the context whether this is the intended meaning. Therefore, I have included all of these terms in the table for completeness."},
