Corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones that are produced in the adrenal cortex. They play an important role in the body's response to stress and in the regulation of inflammation. Therefore, I have identified \"corticosteroid\" as the valid chemical entity and presented it in a Markdown table with one column \"Chemical\"."},

In the original paragraph, there was only one chemical entity, which was \"corticosteroid\". Therefore, I have presented this entity in a Markdown table with one column \"Chemical\", as requested."}
