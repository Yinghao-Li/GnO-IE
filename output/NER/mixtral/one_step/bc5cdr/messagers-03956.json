    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| menopausal |\n\nI have reviewed the paragraph again, and I confirm that \"menopausal\" is the only term that can be considered a disease entity. While menopause is a natural biological process, it is often referred to as a \"condition\" or a \"stage\" in a woman's life, and it can also be associated with various symptoms and health issues, which is why it is sometimes considered a \"disease\" in a broader sense. However, I understand that you may be looking for more specific medical conditions or diseases, in which case, I would like to clarify that the paragraph does not contain any clear disease entities."}
