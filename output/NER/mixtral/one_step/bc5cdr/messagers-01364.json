Vomitus refers to the act of vomiting or the matter vomited, while diarrhea is a condition characterized by frequent and watery stools. Tinnitus is the perception of ringing or other sounds in one or both ears, and loss of hearing is the inability to hear in one or both ears. These entities are presented precisely as they appear in the original paragraph."},

The remaining three entities, diarrhea, tinnitus, and loss of hearing, are all clear examples of diseases or medical conditions. These entities are presented precisely in the same words as they appear in the original paragraph."}
