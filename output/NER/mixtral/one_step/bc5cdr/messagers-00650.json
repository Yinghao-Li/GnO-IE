Dyskinesias refer to involuntary muscle movements, and in this context, they are caused by a drug. Therefore, I have identified \"drug-induced dyskinesias\" as the disease entity in the table above."},

In the original paragraph, there was only one such entity, which is \"drug-induced dyskinesias\". This term refers to a specific medical condition characterized by involuntary muscle movements caused by a drug. Therefore, I have not made any changes to the table I provided earlier."}
