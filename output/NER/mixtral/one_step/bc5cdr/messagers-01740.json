Although it's not a disease itself, it is a common term used in medical contexts to describe the outcome of patients with certain diseases or conditions. In this case, the diseases or conditions that led to the mortality are not specified in the paragraph."},

After reviewing the paragraph again, I realize that there is no clear mention of any specific disease. The term \"high risk surgery\" refers to a category of surgeries that are associated with a higher risk of complications or mortality, rather than a specific disease entity. Therefore, I cannot provide a table of disease entities for this paragraph."}
