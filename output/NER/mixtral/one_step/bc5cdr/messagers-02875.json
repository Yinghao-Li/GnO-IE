In the original paragraph, there are no other entities mentioned besides \"pethidine\", which is a synthetic opioid drug and therefore a chemical. Therefore, the Markdown table remains the same as in my previous response, with one row containing the chemical name \"pethidine\" in the \"Chemical\" column."}
