This is because it refers to a specific medical condition where morphine use leads to memory impairment. The other terms mentioned, such as CCK-8 and CCK2 receptors, are related to neurotransmitters and receptors, not diseases."},

The other terms in the paragraph, such as \"hippocampal LTP\" and \"memory impairment,\" do not refer to chemicals and are therefore not included in the list."}
