The term \"PAS\" in the paragraph refers to paired associative stimulation, which is a technique used in research and not a disease. Therefore, it is not included in the table."}

The terms \"LIDs\" and \"PAS\" are still abbreviations for \"Learned Illusory Disability\" and \"Paired Associative Stimulation,\" respectively, and do not refer to any specific chemicals."}
