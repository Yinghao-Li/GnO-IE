Electron: It is a subatomic particle that carries a negative electric charge. In the context of the paragraph, electrons are used in the process of electron microscopy.\n2. Cytoplasm: It is the material within a cell, excluding the cell nucleus. It is composed of cytosol, organelles, and various chemicals.\n\nNote: I am assuming that the term \"surface cells\" refers to a type of cell and not a chemical entity. If it is a chemical entity, please let me know, and I will update the answer accordingly."},
