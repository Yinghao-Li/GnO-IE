Mefenamic acid-induced neutropenia: Neutropenia is a condition characterized by an abnormally low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, in the blood. In this case, it is caused by mefenamic acid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).\n2. Renal failure: Renal failure, also known as kidney failure, is a condition in which the kidneys lose their ability to function properly, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the body.\n3. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, leading to various symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance."},
