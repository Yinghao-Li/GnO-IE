    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| NMDA receptors |\n| lithium |\n| pilocarpine |\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. NMDA receptors: These are a type of glutamate receptor, which are ion channels in the brain that are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. They are referred to as \"NMDA\" because they are selectively activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate.\n2. lithium: This is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white metal that is highly reactive and flammable. In medicine, lithium salts are used as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of bipolar disorder.\n3. pilocarpine: This is a cholinergic agonist, which means that it binds to and activates muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. It is used in the treatment of glaucoma and other conditions that involve increased pressure within the eye. In research, it is sometimes used to induce seizures in animal models of epilepsy."},
