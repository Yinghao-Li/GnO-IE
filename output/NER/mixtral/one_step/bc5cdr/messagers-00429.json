These terms are used in the context of the effects of the drug cyclophosphamide on the bladder of female mice. While \"delayed toxicity\" refers to the harmful effects that occur with a delay, \"toxicity\" is a more general term that refers to the degree to which a substance can cause damage to living organisms."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| delayed toxicity |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only disease entity that is clearly referred to is \"delayed toxicity\". The term \"toxicity\" is a symptom or effect of a disease, rather than a disease itself. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a disease entity. The terms \"DBA / 2\" and \"C57BL / 6\" are strains of mice, not diseases. Therefore, they are not included in the table."}

In this case, the original paragraph does not contain any other entities that can be classified as chemicals. Therefore, the resulting Markdown table remains the same, containing only one row with the chemical name \"cyclophosphamide\" presented precisely as it appears in the original paragraph."}
