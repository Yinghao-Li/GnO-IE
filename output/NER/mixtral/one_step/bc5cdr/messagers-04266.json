However, since the context of the paragraph is focused on diseases, I have included \"acute eosinophilic myocarditis\" as a disease entity.\n\nThe term \"acute cardiogenic shock\" is a medical condition, but it is not a disease. It is a complication of an underlying disease, in this case, \"cardiac hemosiderosis\". Therefore, I have not included \"acute cardiogenic shock\" as a separate disease entity."}
