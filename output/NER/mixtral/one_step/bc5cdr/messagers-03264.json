However, I have included them as possible diseases since the text uses them in a way that suggests they may be diseases or conditions."}

The other terms, such as \"WT\" and \"PKCa KO,\" do not clearly refer to chemicals and are therefore not included in the table. \"WT\" typically stands for \"wild type\" and refers to the normal or typical form of an organism or gene, while \"PKCa KO\" likely refers to a specific genetic knockout of a protein kinase C isoform, but neither of these terms are chemicals."}
