Therefore, I have identified \"cardiac safety profile\" as the only disease entity in the text."},

In this case, the original paragraph only contains one possible health-related term, \"cardiac safety profile.\" Although it is a more general term and not a specific disease, I will still include it in the table as it is the closest match to a disease entity in the text."}
