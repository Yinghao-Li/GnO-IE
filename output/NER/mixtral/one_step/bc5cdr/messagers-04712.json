Therefore, the table above contains this single disease entity."},

However, I have included it in the table since the prompt did not specify that the entities should be diseases only. The term \"left ventricular systolic and diastolic function\" is not a disease but a condition or state of the heart. However, it is often associated with various heart diseases, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, I have excluded it from the table."}
