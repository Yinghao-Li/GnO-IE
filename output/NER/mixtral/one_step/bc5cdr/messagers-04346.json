Hypertrophy refers to the enlargement of an organ or tissue from the increase in the size of its cells. In this context, hypertrophic hearts imply a disease condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively. Therefore, \"hypertrophic hearts\" is a valid disease entity."},
