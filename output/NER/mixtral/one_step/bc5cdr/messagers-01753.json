It is a type of drug known as a beta-adrenergic agonist, which works by stimulating the beta-adrenergic receptors in the body.\n- ( + ) - propranolol: This is a type of drug known as a beta blocker, which works by blocking the effects of certain hormones on the heart and blood vessels. It is used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, and certain types of tremors.\n- ( - ) - propranolol: This is the opposite enantiomer of propranolol, which also has beta-blocking effects. It is used for the same indications as propranolol.\n\nIn the given paragraph, these three chemical entities are mentioned and are relevant to the discussion of the relative potency of the two forms of propranolol in blocking the effects of isoprenaline."},

The terms \"positive inotropic\" and \"chronotropic responses\" are medical terms that describe the effects of certain substances on the heart, but they do not refer to specific chemicals. Therefore, they are not included in the table."}
