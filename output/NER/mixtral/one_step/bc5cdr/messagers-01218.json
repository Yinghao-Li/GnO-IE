D2 receptor\n\nThese entities are related to the field of pharmacology and neuroscience. Antipsychotic drugs are a class of medications used to manage psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, or disordered thought. The D2 receptor is a type of dopamine receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of motor control, emotion, and cognition. The paragraph mentions that typical antipsychotic drugs have a high affinity with the D2 receptor, which is a common cause of extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS), a group of side effects associated with antipsychotic medications."},

D2 receptor\n\nThe other entity, \"typical antipsychotic drugs,\" is a class of drugs that are used to treat certain mental disorders. While these drugs do have chemical components, they are not a chemical entity themselves. Therefore, I have removed this entity from the table."}
