Encephalopathy is a disease or a disorder of the brain that causes a change in mental status or consciousness. It is explicitly mentioned in the paragraph as \"changes consistent with encephalopathy.\" Therefore, it is a valid disease entity.\n2. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies are not a disease per se, but their presence can indicate certain neurological disorders, such as autoimmune encephalitis. However, the paragraph only mentions their presence and does not explicitly associate them with any specific disease. Therefore, NMDA receptor antibodies are not considered a valid disease entity in this context."},
