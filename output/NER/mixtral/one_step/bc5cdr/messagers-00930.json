It is a condition where there is an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the interstitial space of an organ, leading to tissue scarring and loss of function. In this case, it is specifically located in the renal cortex of animals treated with gentamicin."},

The other term \"gentamicin\" refers to a type of antibiotic and not a disease. Therefore, it is not included in the table. \"Renal cortex\" refers to a specific region of the kidney and not a disease, so it is also not included in the table."}

Similarly, \"renal cortex\" is an anatomical structure and not a chemical entity."}
