Glomerulosclerosis refers to the scarring or hardening of the glomeruli, which are the tiny blood vessel clusters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. Therefore, the valid entity is \"glomerulosclerosis\"."},

Although \"PCE\" is mentioned, it does not clearly refer to a disease entity. PCE stands for polychlorinated biphenyls, which are a group of man-made chemicals that were widely used in electrical equipment, but they are not a disease. Therefore, the valid entity is \"glomerulosclerosis\"."}
