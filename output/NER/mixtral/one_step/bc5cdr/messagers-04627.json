Hyperprolactinemia is a disease or medical condition where there are elevated levels of prolactin in the blood. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates breast development and milk production in women. Hyperprolactinemia can cause various symptoms, including menstrual irregularities, infertility, and reduced sexual desire in women and decreased libido and erectile dysfunction in men."},

Hyperprolactinemia and prolactinemia are both conditions related to the hormone prolactin, but hyperprolactinemia is specifically characterized by abnormally high levels of prolactin in the blood. Dopaminergic systems refer to the neural pathways in the brain that use dopamine as a neurotransmitter. Dopamine is a type of neurotransmitter that plays a role in various physiological processes, including movement, motivation, and reward."},
