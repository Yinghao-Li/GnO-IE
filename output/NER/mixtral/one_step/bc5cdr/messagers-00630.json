It is a medical condition that results in severe damage to the liver and can lead to liver failure.

It is a soluble form of the Fas protein, which is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the immune system.\n2. ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay): ELISA is a biochemical technique used to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample. In this case, it is used to measure the serum levels of sFas in patients with acute liver failure and normal control subjects."},
