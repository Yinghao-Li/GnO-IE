Dysmetria refers to the lack of coordination of movement, typically of the limbs, and is a common symptom of cerebellar disorders. Dysarthria, on the other hand, is a motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury or disease, which may include weakness of the speech muscles, paralysis, or poor coordination. Therefore, these two diseases are the valid entities in the paragraph."},
