Estradiol: Aestradiol is a type of estrogen, which is a class of steroid hormones. It is a chemical that plays an essential role in the estrous cycle of females and the reproductive system.\n2. bupivacaine: Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic used to numb areas of the body for surgical procedures. It is a chemical that works by blocking the transmission of pain signals from the nerves to the brain.\n3. progesterone: Progesterone is a steroid hormone that plays an essential role in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. It is a chemical that prepares the lining of the uterus for implantation and maintains the pregnancy."},
