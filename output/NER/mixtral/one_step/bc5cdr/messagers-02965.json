Elevated IOP is a condition where the pressure inside the eye is higher than normal, which can lead to optic nerve damage and vision loss. It is often associated with glaucoma, but can also be a symptom of other eye diseases."},

Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, often due to high IOP. Therefore, I have added glaucoma as the disease entity in this paragraph."}
