    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| d , l - sotalol |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only chemical entity mentioned is \"d, l-sotalol\". Sotalol is a medication used to treat and prevent various types of heart rhythm disorders. The \"d, l-\" refers to the enantiomers of sotalol, which are optically active forms of the drug. Therefore, the valid chemical entity is \"d, l - sotalol\"."},

The other phrases, \"clinical efficacy\", \"incidence of torsades de pointes\", and \"risk factors for torsades de pointes\" do not refer to specific chemicals, but rather to medical concepts and conditions. Therefore, the valid chemical entity is \"d, l - sotalol\"."}
