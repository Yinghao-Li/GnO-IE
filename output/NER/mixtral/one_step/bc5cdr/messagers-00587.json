    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| bladder irrigation |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the term \"bladder irrigation\" is the only chemical-related entity. It is mentioned in the context of causing a prolongation of the QT interval, which can potentially trigger a serious heart rhythm disorder known as Torsades de Pointes (TdP). Bladder irrigation typically involves the introduction of a solution into the bladder through a catheter to flush out debris, blood clots, or other materials. The solution used for irrigation may contain various chemicals, depending on the specific medical indication and the patient's condition. Therefore, it is appropriate to identify \"bladder irrigation\" as a chemical entity in this context."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| bladder irrigation |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised request, I am asked to remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Chemical.\" In the original paragraph, there were no other entities explicitly referring to chemicals. Therefore, the table remains unchanged, and the only chemical entity identified is \"bladder irrigation.\""}
