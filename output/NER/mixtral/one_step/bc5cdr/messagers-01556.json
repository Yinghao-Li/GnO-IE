It is a condition that can occur after a person has had herpes zoster (shingles), which is a painful skin rash caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Even after the rash has healed, some people may continue to experience pain in the affected area, which is known as post-herpetic neuralgia. If this pain persists for more than three months, it is considered chronic."},
