Tubular damage refers to an injury or harm caused to the tubules in the kidneys, which can lead to various kidney diseases. Therefore, \"marked tubular damage\" is considered a disease entity in this context."},

Although \"renal blood flow (RBF)\" and \"inulin clearance (CIn)\" are medical terms, they do not refer to diseases. RBF is a measure of blood flow in the kidneys, and CIn is a test used to measure kidney function. Therefore, the valid disease entity is \"marked tubular damage\"."}
