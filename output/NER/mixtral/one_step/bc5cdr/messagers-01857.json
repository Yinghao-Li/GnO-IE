The term \"neuroprotection\" refers to a protective mechanism against neural damage or disease, but it is not a disease itself."}

CB1 receptors: CB1 receptors are a type of cannabinoid receptor that are activated by certain chemicals found in cannabis. They are mentioned specifically in the text, so they should be included as a chemical entity.\n2. dopaminergic lesion: A dopaminergic lesion is a type of injury to the brain that affects the production or transmission of dopamine, a neurotransmitter. While \"lesion\" is not a chemical, \"dopaminergic\" indicates that it is related to dopamine, which is a chemical.\n3. L - DOPA: L-DOPA is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter. It is mentioned specifically in the text, so it should be included as a chemical entity.\n4. dyskinesias: Dyskinesias are involuntary movements that can be a side effect of L-DOPA treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. While \"dyskinesias\" is not a chemical, it is mentioned in the context of L-DOPA treatment, so it should be included as a chemical entity."},
