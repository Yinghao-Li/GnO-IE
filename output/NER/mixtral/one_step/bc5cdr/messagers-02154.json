HIT (Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is a condition caused by the administration of heparin, but the term \"HIT\" itself does not refer to a chemical entity. Therefore, the valid chemical entity in the paragraph is \"Heparin\"."},

In the original paragraph, there is only one entity mentioned, which is \"Heparin\". As \"Heparin\" is a well-known anticoagulant drug, it is a clear chemical entity. Therefore, the valid chemical entity in the paragraph is still \"Heparin\", and it is presented in the table as before."}
