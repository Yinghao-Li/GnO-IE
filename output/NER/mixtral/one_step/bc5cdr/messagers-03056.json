Embryolethality refers to the death of an embryo, teratogenicity refers to the ability of a substance to cause birth defects, and growth retardation refers to the inhibition of normal growth and development."},

However, since the paragraph specifically mentions the types of toxicity as embryolethality, teratogenicity, and growth retardation, we can infer that these are specific medical conditions or adverse effects that are being referred to in this context. Therefore, I have included them in the table above."}
