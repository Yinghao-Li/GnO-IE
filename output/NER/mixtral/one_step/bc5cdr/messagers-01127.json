This term refers to a condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of cholesterol and fatty deposits, leading to decreased blood flow and potentially causing chest pain or a heart attack. Therefore, \"coronary arterial disease\" is identified as the disease entity in this paragraph."},

The other term, \"antiandrogenic therapy,\" refers to a type of medical treatment, not a disease. Therefore, \"coronary arterial disease\" is the only valid disease entity in this paragraph."}

Therefore, I have included it as a \"chemical entity\" in this table."},
