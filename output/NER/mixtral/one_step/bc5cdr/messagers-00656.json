It is not a disease itself, but it is included as a potential entity because it is relevant to the context of the paragraph.\n3. \"retinoblastoma\" - This is a specific disease, a type of eye cancer that affects children.\n\nNote that the entities are presented precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},

The other entities, \"ocular motility changes\" and \"subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy,\" do not refer to diseases but rather to symptoms or medical treatments. Therefore, we can remove those entities and present the valid disease entity in a Markdown table as follows:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| retinoblastoma |"}
