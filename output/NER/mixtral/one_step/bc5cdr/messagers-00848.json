These are liver enzymes, and an increase in their levels can indicate liver damage or disease. Therefore, I have included this entire term as a single disease entity in the table."},

This term refers to a condition where the levels of liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase are elevated more than three times the normal upper limit, which can indicate liver damage or disease. Therefore, I have included this entire term as a single disease entity in the table.\n\nThe other terms in the paragraph, such as \"Incidence\" and \"0.3%\", do not clearly refer to diseases and have not been included in the table."}
