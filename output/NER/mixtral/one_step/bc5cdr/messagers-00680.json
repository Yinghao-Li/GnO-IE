The term \"gustatory hyperhidrosis\" refers to a medical condition characterized by excessive sweating in response to taste stimuli, and \"compensatory focal hyperhidrosis\" refers to a condition where excessive sweating occurs in a specific area of the body as a compensatory mechanism for reduced sweating in another area. These terms do not refer to any specific chemical substances."}
