The other terms, such as \"adult offspring kidneys\", \"PCE group\", \"elevated levels of serum creatinine\", and \"urine protein\" are not diseases, so they are not included in the table."},

I have rechecked the paragraph and confirmed that the two identified diseases are the only entities that refer to medical conditions."}

The other entities, \"serum creatinine\" and \"urine protein\", are not chemicals themselves, but rather substances that can be measured and are often used as indicators of kidney function. They are not chemicals in the same sense as PCE, which is a specific compound. Therefore, I have removed them from the list."}
