However, ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) and SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) are abbreviations for molecules or genetic variations. They are not diseases themselves, but I am assuming that you want me to list them as entities since they are the only recognizable terms in the text.

If you are looking for actual disease entities, I would recommend providing a different paragraph as this one does not contain any references to diseases."}
