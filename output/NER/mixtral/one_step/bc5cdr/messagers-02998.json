It is a condition that affects the breast tissue and can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). The rats in the study were induced with chemically-induced breast tumors, which suggests that the tumors are malignant. However, the term \"breast cancer\" is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, so we can only identify \"breast tumors\" as the disease entity."},

The other terms, such as \"chemically\" and \"cancerous\", do not refer to specific diseases, but rather describe the method of inducing the tumors or the potential malignancy of the tumors. Therefore, the valid disease entity is \"breast tumors\", which is presented in the table as a single-column Markdown table."}
