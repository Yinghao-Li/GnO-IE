Therefore, it is not included in the table. The term \"isolated aspects of clinical pain disorders\" is not a disease entity, but rather a description of specific symptoms of various disease conditions. Therefore, it is also not included in the table."}

These are substances that are being injected intradermally for experimental purposes. Glutamate is a type of amino acid that functions as a neurotransmitter, while capsaicin is a compound found in chili peppers that can cause a burning sensation when ingested or applied to the skin. Both of these substances are known to cause hyperalgesia and allodynia, which are symptoms that mimic isolated aspects of clinical pain disorders."},
