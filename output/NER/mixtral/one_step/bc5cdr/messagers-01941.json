These are medical conditions that affect the brain and are caused by different mechanisms. Ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain, while haemorrhagic stroke is caused by a rupture of a blood vessel in the brain. Cocaine is identified as a risk factor for both these types of strokes."},
