Jaundice is a yellowish pigmentation of the skin, whites of the eyes, and mucous membranes caused by an increase in bilirubin in the bloodstream. It is not a disease itself but a symptom of various underlying medical conditions. However, since the text mentions jaundice as a condition, it is considered a disease entity in this context."},

In this context, \"jaundice\" is the only clear disease entity. The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"incidence,\" \"liver transplantation,\" and \"death,\" are not diseases themselves but rather outcomes, procedures, or events related to diseases. Therefore, the table above contains the single valid disease entity, \"jaundice.\""}
