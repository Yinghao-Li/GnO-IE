Although \"jj rats\" is not explicitly a disease, it is a specific strain or group of rats used in the study. However, since the context of the task is to identify disease entities, I am providing \"jj rats\" as the only potential candidate. Please note that the actual medical condition or disease that the \"jj rats\" are affected by is not specified in the paragraph."},

The term \"jj rats\" is not a disease but a specific strain or group of rats used in the study. Therefore, I have added \"No clear disease entities found in the paragraph\" in the table to reflect this."}

The term \"aspirin\" is a common name for acetylsalicylic acid, which is a chemical compound. However, in this paragraph, aspirin is mentioned only in the context of its administration to rats, and not as a chemical entity itself. Therefore, the Markdown table above contains one row with the chemical name \"PGF2 alpha\"."}
