A seizure is a transient symptom of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can cause various physical changes, such as involuntary muscle movements or staring spells. In this case, the seizure is described as \"convulsive\", indicating that it involves involuntary muscle contractions and relaxations. Therefore, the valid disease entity is \"convulsive seizure\"."},

Therefore, they are not included in the table."}
