This is because it refers to the intentional use of a substance (in this case, amisulpride) to harm oneself. The specific substances mentioned (5 g and 3.6 g of amisulpride) are not considered disease entities, as they are not diseases themselves but rather the cause of the disease (poisoning) in this context."},

It mentions the same chemical compound (amisulpride) with a different quantity (3.6 g)."},
