However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact disease that \"TS\" stands for. It could potentially refer to Takotsubo syndrome, also known as broken heart syndrome, or another medical condition with similar abbreviations. Therefore, I have presented \"TS\" as the disease entity in this case."},

The other terms in the paragraph, such as \"coronary angiogram,\" \"coronary arteries,\" \"left ventricular ejection fraction,\" and \"wall motion abnormalities,\" are medical procedures or measurements rather than diseases.
