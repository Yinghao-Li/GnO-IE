It is a type of disease characterized by high blood pressure. The term \"adult population\" is not a disease entity, as it refers to a group of people and not a disease. Similarly, \"children\" are not a disease entity, but rather a group of individuals. The term \"generically\" is not a disease entity, as it refers to the availability of a medication without a brand name. The term \"Aldomet\" is not a disease entity, as it is a trade name for the medication methyldopa."}
