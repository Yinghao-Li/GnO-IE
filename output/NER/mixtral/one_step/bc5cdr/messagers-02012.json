In the context of the paragraph, \"liver\" is being described in terms of its physical attributes, specifically its size and weight. However, the term \"liver\" is not being used as a disease or medical condition. Instead, it is being used to refer to the organ itself. Therefore, it does not qualify as a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nNonetheless, I have included it in the table as it is the closest term to a disease entity in the paragraph."},

The paragraph describes the physical attributes of the liver in mice, but it does not mention any specific diseases or medical conditions. Therefore, there are no valid entities to present in a Markdown table."}
