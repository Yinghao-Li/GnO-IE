It is a medication that was previously used to treat nausea in pregnant women, but was banned due to its severe side effects causing birth defects. In this paragraph, it is mentioned in the context of its subclinical neurotoxic potential, which means the drug's ability to damage nerve cells at doses lower than those required to produce clinically evident symptoms."},
