In the given paragraph, the sequential measurements of cardiac output were performed on animals administered with DOX, either alone or in combination with HPMA copolymer. The reduction in cardiac function observed in these animals suggests the onset of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Therefore, DOX is identified as a disease entity in this context."},

HPMA copolymer and free DOX are not diseases, but rather forms of drug administration. Therefore, only DOX is identified as a disease entity in this context."}

It is a delivery vehicle for the drug, not a drug itself. Therefore, it is not included in the table."}
