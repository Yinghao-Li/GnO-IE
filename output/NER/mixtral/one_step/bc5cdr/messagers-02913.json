This term is used to describe a clinical syndrome characterized by myelin loss in the spinal cord, which can be caused by various factors such as vitamin B12 deficiency or copper deficiency. The MRI results suggest changes in the spine that are consistent with this disease."},

The term \"MRI\" refers to a medical imaging technique and not a disease. Therefore, it should not be included in the list of disease entities. The term \"changes\" is a general description of the MRI findings and not a specific disease. Therefore, it should not be included in the list of disease entities either. The term \"subacute combined degeneration\" is the only specific disease entity mentioned in the paragraph."}
