However, \"lymph node\" is not a disease itself, but rather a part of the lymphatic system. If \"Disease\" entities should only refer to actual diseases, then there would be no valid entities in this paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| temsirolimus therapy |\n\nNote: In this paragraph, there is only one entity that can be considered a \"Disease,\" and that is \"temsirolimus therapy.\" Temsirolimus is a medication used to treat certain types of cancer, so it can be considered a disease in a broad sense. However, it is not a disease in the strict sense, and the paragraph does not provide enough context to determine if it is being used to treat a specific disease. Therefore, the list of \"Disease\" entities is empty."}
