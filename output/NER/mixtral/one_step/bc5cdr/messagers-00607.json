The term \"hyperventilation maneuver\" is a medical procedure and not a chemical. Similarly, \"spontaneous ventilation\" refers to the natural breathing process and not a chemical. Therefore, the Markdown table above contains one row with the chemical name \"pilocarpine\" in the \"Chemical\" column."}
