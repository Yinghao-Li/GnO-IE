It is a medical condition that can cause various symptoms, such as heart rhythm abnormalities (e.g., bradycardia), which is the case in the paragraph provided."},

The other terms, such as \"coronary artery bypass grafting,\" \"myocardial infarction,\" \"loss of consciousness,\" and \"bradycardia\" are medical conditions or symptoms, but they do not directly refer to chemicals. Hyperkalemia, on the other hand, is a medical condition that is caused by an imbalance of potassium ions in the body, making it a chemical entity."}
