However, \"C + E\" is a term that is used to describe a group, and it is contrasted with \"C only\" group, indicating that \"C + E\" might refer to a condition or state that is different from the \"C only\" group. As the prompt asks for \"Disease\" entities, we can interpret \"C + E\" as a condition or state that is being studied in the context of the paragraph.
