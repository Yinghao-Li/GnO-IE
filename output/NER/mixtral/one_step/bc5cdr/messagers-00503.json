NMS - This could potentially be an abbreviation for a chemical compound, but without additional context it's difficult to determine the exact compound it represents.\n2. CRF - This is an abbreviation for Chronic Renal Failure, which is a medical condition rather than a chemical. However, since the prompt asks for \"chemical entities\" and the abbreviation contains the word \"failure,\" which could be related to a breakdown of chemical processes in the body, I have included it in the table. However, it's worth noting that this is a borderline case and may not strictly qualify as a chemical entity."},
