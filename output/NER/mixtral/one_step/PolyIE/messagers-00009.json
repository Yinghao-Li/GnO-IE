Smaller domain sizes in the active blend layer could afford a short exciton diffusion length , which is desirable to suppress the recombination loss. 44 The active layer morphologies recorded are in good accordance with the J sc performance of the PffBBn : PC71BM - based devices. Consistent with the observed homogeneous donor : acceptor network with the smallest rms roughness , the PffBB-14 - based device exhibited the highest J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 and FF of 64.36% , suggesting efficient charge dissociation and transport. In short , AFM results confirm that the PffBB-14:PC71BM blend layer exhibited a desirable morphology for efficient photovoltaic properties. Our results also indicated that the extremely strong aggregation strength of the donor polymer would hinder for the formation of a desirable homogeneous donor / acceptor interpenetration network for efficient photovoltaic performance . We have developed a new series of donor - acceptor copolymer derived from 4,5-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and dialkyl-substituted difluorinated 4,7-di-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole units , such as PffBB-n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , and 16 ) as a low band gap donor material for the application of highly efficient BHJ PSCs. PffBB-n exhibited intriguing strong and controllable aggrega - tion behavior , which can be modulated by the size of the alkyl side chain attached on the polymer backbone , processing temperature and solvent used. Because of the strong aggregation behavior , the absorption cut - off of the polymer thin films could extend to ∼ 780 nm , giving rise to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Taking advantage of the temperature - dependent aggregation effect , BHJ PSCs with PffBB-n:PC71BM as an active blend layer spin - coated at different temperatures were fabricated and investigated which showed considerably various photovoltaic performance. Among PSCs fabricated , the PffBB-14:PC71BM - based device with an active blend layer spin - coated at 80 °C , showed the best photovoltaic performance with the highest PCE of 9.93% , a large V oc of 0.92 V , a highest J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36% . Such an excellent device performance was attributed to the strong and aggregation - broadened absorption , superior exciton dissociation , desirable film morphology , better balanced charge carrier mobilities , and minimal recombination loss. Our results demonstrated that the side chain length modification and processing temperature modulation were proved to be useful for tuning polymer interchain interactions , absorption properties , active layer morphology , and charge carrier properties , thus optimizing the ultimate device performance of BHJ PSCs.
