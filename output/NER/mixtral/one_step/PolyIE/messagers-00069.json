Herein , the EQE curves of the devices with the optimal performance are shown in Figure 8. The devices showed a relatively high photoconversion efficiency over the whole wavelength range of 300-700 nm , with monochromatic EQE values around 50-60 % . Compared to the absorption spectra of pristine polymers , the significantly broadened EQE responses in the visible region can be attributed to both the intrinsic absorptions of the polymers and PC71BM. Also , it can be noted that devices based on PzNDTDTBO show stronger Field - Effect Transistor Properties. The performances of polymer field - effect transistors based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO were investigated using a bottom-gate , bottomcontact configuration. . ( Figure 9 ). All devices with L = 5 μm showed the highest hole mobility at different annealing temperatures. The devices showed a typical p - type transporting characteristic measured under ambient conditions. As shown in Table 4 , for both polymers the annealing temperature tends to affect the hole mobility. All devices based on both polymers were annealed at 60 , 100 , 140 , 180 , 220 , and 260 °C , and both polymers showed thermal stability on each device. Figure 10 shows the output curves and transfer characteristics of the OFETs based on the polymers at 25 °C and optimal annealing temperature. ( Other OFETs data at different annealing temperatures are shown in Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2. ) After thermal annealing , the hole mobilities of both copolymers are increased , which implies that the crystallinity of the polymer films and ordered lamellar structure of π-π closepacking for polymer main chain are significantly improved at higher temperatures. High current modulation is observed with on / off current ratio of 10^6 -10^7 for PzNDTBTBO while PzNDTDTBT shows relatively lower on / off ratio of 10^3 -10^4. The resulting optimal P-channel transistors demonstrate high hole mobilities of 0.43 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and 0.34 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTBTBO. Both the hole mobilities are among the highest values for BT-or BO - based polymers. In order to deeply study the variation of the performances of OFETs of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO after annealing , the thin - film microstructures and topographies were investigated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and AFM. Figure 11 shows XRD patterns of the polymer thin films deposited on OTSmodified Si / SiO 2 substrates. For both polymers , obvious diffraction peaks were detected before the samples were annealed , which indicates that some degree of crystallinity has been formed at room temperature. PzNDTDTBT showed a sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = 21.4 ° and two weak peaks at 23.8 ° and 26.6 ° for the as-prepared thin film.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
