In contrast , for (BDTT-TPD)-(BDTT-DPP)-(BDTT-TPD) , the electron density distribution in the HOMO wave function is different from those of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 5c,d ). Therefore , the small portions of DPP could hinder the preseparation of an exciton into a loosely Coulombically bound exciton , which suppresses electron transfer from donor ( polymer ) to acceptor ( PCBM ). 48-50 Therefore , one possible explanation of the lower PCEs in P5 and P6 is that the DPP acts as a trapping site , resulting in poor intramolecular charge transfer. In contrast , as evidenced in the results of the DFT calculations for (BDTT-DPP)-(BDTT-TPD)-(BDTT-DPP) , the electron distribution in the HOMO and LUMO wave functions is similar to those of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 ( Figures 5a,b ). Such a trapping effect is expected to be trivial in P2 and P3 random terpolymers with a higher DPP to TPD ratio. Therefore , the incorporation of different electron - deficient units could significantly influence the intramolecular charge transfer , suggesting that the optimum composition is required to tune the intra-and intermolecular charge transfer and their performance of PSCs. More detailed studies are currently underway. Finally , to further improve the PCE of P3 : PC71BM , methanol was spin - coated on the top of the active layer before electrode deposition. The effect of a polar solvent in such a case has been reported. 51-53 The P3 : PC71BM device exhibited a V OC of 0.76 V , a J SC of 16.32 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.51 with a high PCE value of 6.33% . Structural Properties and Morphological Behavior. The compositional effect of the two electron - deficient groups on the polymer packing and nanostructured order in thin films was investigated by grazing incidence X-ray scattering ( GIXS ) measurement. A thin layer ( 40-50 nm ) of PEDOT : PSS was spin - coated onto silicon substrates , and the pristine polymer or the blended thin films were produced by spin - coating on top of the PEDOT : PSS layer. Figure S8 shows the GIXS patterns of the pristine P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 , while Figure 6 presents the GIXS patterns of the P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 blended films with either PC71BM or PC61BM under optimized device conditions.
