Make sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Integration of the two distinct peaks for all random terpolymers was consistent with the feed ratio of DPP to TPD. The compositions of different terpolymers were also measured by elemental analysis and both values show good agreement. Thermal Properties. The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure S2. The TGA revealed that the decomposition temperatures ( T d ) of P1-P7 ( 5% weight loss ) are 405 , 407 , 413 , 417 , 433 , 433 , and 444 °C , respectively. Thus , the thermal stability of the polymers improved as the amount of TPD increased. All of the polymers exhibited excellent thermal stability , which is important for their applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices. 35,36 Optical Properties. The optical properties of all the polymers in dilute chloroform solutions and thin films are shown in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 2. All the random terpolymers exhibited multiple absorption bands ranging from 300 to 900 nm , a common feature of polymers based on donor and acceptor units. 37 In addition , all polymers showed broader absorption in thin films compared to in solution due to stronger interchain aggregation. 28 The optical band gaps of P1-P7 were estimated to be 1.38 , 1.38 , 1.40 , 1.42 , 1.49 , 1.55 , and 1.85 eV , respectively , based on the onset of the light absorption. The absorption onset of P7 was blue - shifted compared to P1 , which was due to the weaker electronwithdrawing character of TPD compared to DPP. Upon comparison of the absorption onset of P2-P6 , a similar trend was observed with a gradual blue - shift from P2 to P6 with higher TPD content. In addition , the increased amount of TPD caused the appearance of a new absorption band around 500- 600 nm , which can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) band from BDTT to TPD. On the other hand , the absorption band around 700-800 nm , the ICT band from BDTT to DPP , gradually decreased as the content of TPD increased. By regulating the composition of the electrondeficient units , broad absorptions of the random copolymers , P2-P6 were observed from 400 to 900 nm compared to the parent polymers , P1 and P7 , indicating that incorporating two different electron - deficient units into polymer backbone is an effective method to broaden the absorption band and control the optical band gap. Electrochemical Properties. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements ( Figure 3 ). All CV measurements were recorded in a solution of 0.1 M Bu 4 NPF 6 in nitrogen - saturated anhydrous acetonitrile at a scanning rate of 50 mV / s. The results of the electrochemical measurements are listed in Table 2.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
