These entities include \"the donor\" and \"the acceptor,\" which are materials likely used in a donor-acceptor configuration within the devices. Additionally, \"blend films\" are mentioned, which could refer to a combination of different material layers within the device. Lastly, \"the cathode metal\" is mentioned, which is a material used in the construction of the device's cathode."
