The entity \"the blend of the copolymer and PC71BM\" is a material made from a mixture of the copolymer and PC71BM. The other two entities, \"the copolymer\" and \"PC71BM\", are not explicitly mentioned as materials in the paragraph, but they are implied to be materials since they are used in the fabrication of the solar cell device. Therefore, I have removed the two implied entities and kept only the explicit one in the final answer."
