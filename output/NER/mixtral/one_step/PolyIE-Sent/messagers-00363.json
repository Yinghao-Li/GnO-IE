These are:\n\n1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM): This is a type of microscopy used to study the surface morphology of materials at a very high resolution.\n2. 1 : 4 w / w blend films: This is a specific type of film that has been optimized for study. The \"1 : 4 w / w\" refers to the weight ratio of the components in the blend."
