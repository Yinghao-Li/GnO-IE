Here's the explanation:\n\n* \"the lower FF\" refers to a property value, where FF stands for \"fill factor,\" a parameter used in solar cell characterization. The fill factor is a measure of the quality of a solar cell and is defined as the ratio of the maximum power point to the product of the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current. A lower fill factor indicates a less efficient solar cell."
