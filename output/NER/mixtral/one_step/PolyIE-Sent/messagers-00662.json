Instead, they are examples of common organic solvents in which the substance with \"good solubility\" and \"three solubilizing n-dodecyl groups\" can dissolve.\n\nThe remaining entities, \"good solubility\" and \"three solubilizing n-dodecyl groups,\" are the only ones that clearly refer to the value of a material property. \"Good solubility\" describes the ability of a substance to dissolve in a solvent, while \"three solubilizing n-dodecyl groups\" refers to a chemical structure that enhances the solubility of a substance."
