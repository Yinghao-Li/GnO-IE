In this case, the property names are \"crystallinity\" and \"compositions of T and 2T\".\n\n\"Crystallinity\" is a property that describes the degree of structural order in a material. Here, it is being controlled by varying the compositions of T and 2T.\n\n\"Compositions of T and 2T\" refer to the relative amounts of thiophene (T) and dithiophene (2T) present in the terpolymers. This property can be varied to control the crystallinity of the terpolymers."
