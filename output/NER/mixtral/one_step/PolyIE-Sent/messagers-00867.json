However, it is closely related to the material properties of the polymer films, so I have included it in the table.\n* The ordered lamellar structure of π-π closepacking is a specific arrangement of molecules in the polymer, which can be considered a material property. However, it is not clear from the context whether this is a property that is being measured or changed, or simply a description of the structure. Therefore, I have not included it in the table."
