These are:\n1. 10^-2 cm^2 (the area with a value of 10 to the power of -2 in square centimeters)\n2. V (the symbol for voltage)\n3. -1 (the exponent for the unit siemens, S, which is the reciprocal of ohms, Ω)\n4. s^-1 (the reciprocal of seconds, s, which is used to describe frequency)\n\nIt's worth noting that the paragraph seems to describe a physical quantity with units of electrical conductivity, which is typically given in units of S/m (siemens per meter) or Ω-1 m-1 (ohm-1 meter-1). The value 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 can be converted to these units by multiplying by 100 to convert the area from square centimeters to square meters, and then dividing by the speed of light in meters per second to convert the units to ohm-1 meter-1. However, the exact conversion will depend on the context and the specific physical quantity being described."
