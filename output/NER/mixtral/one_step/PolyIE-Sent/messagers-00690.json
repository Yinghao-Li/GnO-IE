I have grouped them together as \"w / w (1:1)\" to indicate that they are related.\n* I have removed \"ITO\" and \"PEDOT : PSS\" from the list as they are more likely to refer to layers or structures in the device rather than material properties. However, it is possible that they could be considered material properties in some contexts, so I have included them here for completeness."
