I see that the other entities I had identified as \"Material Name\" entities are not actually referring to specific materials, but rather to the performance of a material (PSC) and a comparison to other materials (other reported random terpolymers).\n\nThank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will strive to be more precise in my future responses."
