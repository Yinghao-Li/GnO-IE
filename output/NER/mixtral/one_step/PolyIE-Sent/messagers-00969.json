Conjugated polymers: These are a class of polymers that have alternating double and single bonds, which facilitate the delocalization of electrons, leading to unique optical and electrical properties. They are designed with specific energy levels and light absorption characteristics for use in bulk heterojunction photovoltaic solar cells (BHJ PSC).\n2. BHJ PSC: This stands for Bulk Heterojunction Photovoltaic Solar Cells, which are a type of organic solar cell that uses a mixture of electron donor and acceptor materials to create a bulk heterojunction. This structure facilitates charge separation and transport, leading to improved solar cell efficiency."
