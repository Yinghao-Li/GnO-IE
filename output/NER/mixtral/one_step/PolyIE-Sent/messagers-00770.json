In the given paragraph, it is acting as a donor material.\n* PCBM: This is an abbreviation for Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, which is a fullerene derivative commonly used as an electron acceptor material in organic solar cells."

DPP is an abbreviation for diketopyrrolopyrrole, which is a type of organic material, but it is not clear if it refers to a specific material or a class of materials. Similarly, polymer is a general term for a class of materials, and it is not clear if it refers to a specific material in this context."
