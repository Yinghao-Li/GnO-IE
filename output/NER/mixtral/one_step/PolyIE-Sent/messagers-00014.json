For example, \"PBT\" and \"PTT\" are names of materials, but not material properties themselves. Similarly, \"energy levels of the parent P3HT\" is a phrase that refers to the energy levels of a specific material, but it is not a material property in and of itself. Instead, I have specified the HOMO and LUMO energy levels as the material properties in this paragraph."
