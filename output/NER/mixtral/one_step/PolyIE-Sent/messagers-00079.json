Similarly, \"electron transport\" and \"exciton diffusion\" are also material properties, as they refer to the ability of a material to conduct electricity and the movement of energy within a material, respectively."

The other two entities, \"effective electron transport\" and \"exciton diffusion\", are also values of material properties, but they are not explicitly stated as properties of PffBB-n.
