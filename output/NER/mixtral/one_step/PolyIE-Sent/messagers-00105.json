The other entity, \"best photovoltaic performance\", is a desirable outcome that can be achieved through the optimization of material properties, but it is not a property itself. Therefore, I have removed it from the list.\n\nExciton dissociation is a material property that describes the ability of a material to separate excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) into free charge carriers, which is an important process in photovoltaic devices."
