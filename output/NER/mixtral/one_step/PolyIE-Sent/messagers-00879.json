AFM images: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a technique used to analyze the topography of surfaces at a very high resolution. Here, AFM images refer to the visual representations of the surface topography obtained using this technique.\n2. polymer thin films: These are thin layers of polymer material used in the experiment. Thin films are essential in various applications, such as coatings, optics, and microelectronics.\n3. OTSmodified SiO 2 / Si substrates: OTS (Octadecyltrichlorosilane) is a chemical used to modify the surface of SiO2 (Silicon dioxide) or Silicon substrates. This modification enhances the adhesion and stability of the polymer thin films."
