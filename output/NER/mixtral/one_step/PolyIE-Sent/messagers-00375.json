It is a term used in molecular orbital theory, which is a fundamental concept in chemistry and physics.\n2. VOC: VOC stands for Open-Circuit Voltage. It is a term used in photovoltaics and electronics to describe the maximum voltage that can be produced by a solar cell or other type of voltage source.\n\nBoth LUMO levels and VOC are material properties, and therefore, they are considered as material names in this context."

LUMO levels: This term clearly refers to a material property, specifically the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital in a material. It is a concept used in molecular orbital theory, which is a fundamental concept in chemistry and physics.\n\nThe other term, \"VOC,\" was identified as a material name in my previous response, but upon further review, I realized that it is not a material name in this context. VOC usually stands for \"Volatile Organic Compounds\" in other contexts, but in this paragraph, it is an abbreviation for \"Open-Circuit Voltage,\" which is a property of a device or system, not a material. Therefore, I have removed it from the list of material names."
