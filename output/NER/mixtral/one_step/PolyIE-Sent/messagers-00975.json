In this context, it refers to copolymers that contain DPP units.\n* fused heteroarenes: Heteroarenes are aromatic compounds that contain at least one heteroatom (an atom that is not carbon) in their ring structure. Fused heteroarenes are multiple heteroarene units that are fused together. These materials have been used in organic electronics due to their excellent optoelectronic properties."
