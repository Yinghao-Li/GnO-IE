The remaining entities are more specific and can be considered as \"Material Name\" entities.\n\n\"Polymer\" is a broad category of materials, and without further specification, it is not clear which specific polymer is being referred to in this context. Similarly, \"Al\" could refer to any compound containing aluminum, so it is not a clear \"Material Name\" entity.\n\nOn the other hand, \"ITO\" refers to a specific material made of Indium Tin Oxide, \"PEDOT : PSS\" is a specific material made of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, \"PC71BM\" is a specific material made of [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, and \"TiO x\" is a specific material made of Titanium Oxide with a variable amount of oxygen. These entities are more specific and can be considered as \"Material Name\" entities."
