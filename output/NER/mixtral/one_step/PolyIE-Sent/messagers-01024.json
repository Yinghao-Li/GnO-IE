The other terms, such as PCE and efficiency, are more related to the measurement or quantification of a material property rather than the property itself. However, since the context of the paragraph is about the efficiency of anthracene-based low band-gap conjugated copolymers, it is reasonable to infer that \"highest efficiency\" refers to a material property."
