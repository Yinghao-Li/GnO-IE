However, it is important to note that the last three entities are not materials themselves, but rather properties or characteristics of the polymers mentioned earlier in the sentence. Nonetheless, I have included them in the table as they are referred to using descriptive language that could be interpreted as material names in other contexts. The first entity, \"polymers,\" is the only clear and unambiguous material name in the paragraph."
