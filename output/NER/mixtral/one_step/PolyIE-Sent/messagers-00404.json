These entities are mentioned as a single phrase in the original paragraph, and they refer to a property of the copolymers. The phrase \"measured\" indicates that the band gaps have been determined or calculated, while \"optical\" suggests that the band gaps are related to the interaction of light with the copolymers. The word \"band gaps\" refers to the range of energies between which a material can absorb or transmit light. Overall, the phrase \"measured optical band gaps\" provides important information about the properties of the copolymers."
