COL17A1 related disease: Although not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, the decreased expression of type XVII collagen is caused by mutations in the COL17A1 gene, which can lead to various skin disorders, including generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa."},

The other entity, \"COL17A1\", is a gene that encodes a protein associated with the disease, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, the valid disease entity is presented in the table above."}
