Troponin T is a protein that is part of the troponin complex, which plays a crucial role in muscle contraction. Cardiac troponin T is a specific form of this protein that is found in heart muscle cells. Elevated levels of cardiac troponin T in the bloodstream can indicate damage to the heart muscle, which can be a sign of various heart conditions such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), heart failure, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider \"human cardiac troponin T (cTNT)\" as a disease entity in this context."},
