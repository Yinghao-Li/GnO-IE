It is mentioned as the specific genetic mutation that patients have. The term \"common ancestry\" suggests that many patients have inherited this mutation from a common ancestor, and the phrase \"spontaneously recurring\" implies that new cases of this mutation can occur independently, but such cases are rare. Therefore, \"ATM mutations\" is the valid disease entity in this paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| ATM mutations |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the term \"ATM mutations\" is the only disease-related entity. The term \"common ancestry\" is not a disease entity, but rather a description of the origin of the mutations in the patients. Similarly, the phrase \"spontaneously recurring\" is not a disease entity, but rather a description of how the mutations can occur. Therefore, \"ATM mutations\" is the valid disease entity in this paragraph."}
