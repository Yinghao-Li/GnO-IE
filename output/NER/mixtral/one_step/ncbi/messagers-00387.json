The term \"Jewish mutation carriers\" refers to individuals who carry a genetic mutation, but it does not clearly refer to a disease. Therefore, it is not included in the table. The context of the paragraph suggests that there might be different allelic patterns at the BRCA1 locus, which might indicate that the mutation arose independently in some Jewish mutation carriers. However, the focus of the paragraph is still on the BRCA1 gene, which is a disease-related entity."}
