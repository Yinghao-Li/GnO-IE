These are the only entities that clearly refer to diseases, and therefore, they are the valid entities.\n\nThe term \"germ-line mutations\" refers to genetic mutations that are present at birth and can be passed down from parents to their offspring. It does not refer to a disease. Similarly, the term \"tumor suppressor\" refers to a type of gene that helps prevent cancer by controlling cell growth and division. It is not a disease itself.\n\nTherefore, the valid entities are \"breast cancer\" and \"ovarian cancer\", and they are presented in the table above."}
