ATM is a gene associated with a hereditary disorder known as ataxia-telangiectasia, which is characterized by neurological deterioration, immune system problems, and an increased risk of cancer. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention the disease but refers to the \"ATM cDNA,\" which is a gene related to the disease. Therefore, I have identified \"ATM\" as the \"Disease\" entity in the table."},
