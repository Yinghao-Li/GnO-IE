It is a rare form of eye cancer that usually develops in early childhood. In this case, the paragraph mentions a \"novel missense mutation\" in patients from a \"retinoblastoma pedigree\" who show only mild expression of the tumor phenotype. Therefore, \"retinoblastoma\" is the only valid disease entity that can be identified in the paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| retinoblastoma |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only disease entity mentioned is \"retinoblastoma\". The term \"tumor phenotype\" refers to the physical characteristics of a tumor, which is a manifestation of the disease rather than the disease itself. Therefore, \"tumor phenotype\" is not a valid disease entity. The term \"missense mutation\" refers to a type of genetic mutation that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in a protein. It is not a disease entity, but rather a genetic mechanism that can contribute to the development of a disease. Therefore, the valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"retinoblastoma\"."}
