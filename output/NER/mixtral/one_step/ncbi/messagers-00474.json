    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| mutations that lead to exon skipping or premature protein truncation |\n\nI have kept the same response as before, as the term \"mutations\" in this context still refers to genetic mutations that can be associated with genetic disorders and diseases. However, I understand that it might not be the exact answer you are looking for. If you need diseases with common names, the paragraph does not provide enough information for identification of such diseases."}
