After reviewing the paragraph again, I still believe that \"HLA-typed samples\" is the only possible disease entity, as it refers to samples that have been typed for HLA genes, which are associated with various diseases. However, I acknowledge that \"HLA-typed samples\" is not a specific disease but rather a type of genetic sample that may be associated with various diseases. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to include it as a disease entity in this context."}
