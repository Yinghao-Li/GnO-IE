It is a genetic condition that affects the development of the eye and is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the iris. The mention of \"aniridia patients\" in the paragraph confirms the identification of this disease entity."},

The other term \"pathological missense mutations\" refers to genetic mutations that result in the production of an abnormal protein, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, it is not included in the table."}
