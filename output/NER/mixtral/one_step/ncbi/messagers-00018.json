The absence of this protein kinase is associated with a form of muscular dystrophy known as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). However, since the term is mentioned as \"DMPK absence\" in the paragraph, I have listed it as is."},

The term \"DMPK absence\" refers to the absence of a protein kinase (myotonic dystrophy protein kinase) but does not directly refer to a disease. Therefore, there are no valid disease entities to present in a table."}
