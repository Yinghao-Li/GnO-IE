While it is more commonly known as a gene (Mullerian inhibiting substance), there is a rare genetic disorder called \"Persistent MÃ¼llerian duct syndrome\" which is sometimes abbreviated as PMDS or MIS. However, based on the context provided, it seems more likely that MIS refers to the gene rather than the disorder. Nonetheless, I have included it as a potential disease entity in the table."},
