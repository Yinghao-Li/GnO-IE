A phenotype refers to the observable characteristics or traits of an individual, which are the result of the interaction between their genetic makeup and the environment. In this case, the phenotype is associated with a disease, indicating that the mutations in the WFS1 gene are leading to a particular disease condition in the affected individuals from six WFS families."},
