These are genetic mutations that can increase the risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer. They are specifically mentioned in the paragraph as the object of detection, so they are the relevant disease entities."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| BRCA2 mutations |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe only entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"the four BRCA2 mutations\". Since \"mutations\" are changes in the DNA sequence that can lead to diseases or disorders, they are considered disease entities. Therefore, the valid entity is \"BRCA2 mutations\".\n\nThe phrase \"the odds of detection\" is not a disease entity, but rather a measure of the likelihood of detecting something. In this case, it refers to the likelihood of detecting the BRCA2 mutations."}
