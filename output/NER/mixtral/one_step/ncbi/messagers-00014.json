DMPK (Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase) is a gene associated with certain types of muscular dystrophy. In this experiment, the researchers have created a genetic modification where the DMPK gene is \"knocked out\" in mice, meaning it is non-functional. The mice with this genetic modification are referred to as \"DMPK [- / -] knockout\" mice."},
