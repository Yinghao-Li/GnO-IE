This disease is implied through the use of the \"DM region\" in the context of a transgenic mouse model being used to study somatic instability of a CTG repeat expansion. Myotonic Dystrophy is a genetic disorder caused by expansions of CTG repeats in the DMPK gene, which is why the \"DM region\" is relevant in this context."},
