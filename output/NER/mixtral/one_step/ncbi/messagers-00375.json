DMS: It is mentioned twice in the paragraph, and both instances refer to the same disease.\n2. exon 8 mutations among 46 , XY patients with female phenotype: Although it is not the disease itself, it is a specific condition related to the disease.\n3. exon 8 mutations among 46 , XY patients with sexual ambiguity or male phenotype: Again, it is not the disease itself, but it is a related condition that is specific to the disease."},

Therefore, they are not included in the table."}
