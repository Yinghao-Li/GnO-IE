It is a serious form of skin cancer that can be difficult to treat if it spreads to other parts of the body.\n\nThe other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"germline mutations,\" \"p16 gene,\" and \"CDK4 gene,\" are not diseases themselves but rather genetic factors that may contribute to the development of melanoma."},
