Gastrulation is a process in the embryonic development of many organisms, and a defect in this process can lead to various developmental disorders or diseases. Therefore, I have identified \"gastrulation defect\" as the disease entity in the paragraph."},

The other terms in the paragraph, such as \"mutant Smad4 ES cells\" and \"wild - type tetraploid morulae,\" refer to specific types of cells or embryos and do not clearly refer to a disease. Therefore, I have only identified \"gastrulation defect\" as the disease entity in the paragraph."}
