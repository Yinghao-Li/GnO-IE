It is a genetic disorder characterized by an excess of phenylalanine in the blood, which can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems if not treated promptly. The disorder is often detected through newborn screening and managed through dietary restrictions and supplements."},

The other term \"PAH mutations\" refers to genetic mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, which is associated with hyperphenylalaninemia, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, it is not included in the table."}
