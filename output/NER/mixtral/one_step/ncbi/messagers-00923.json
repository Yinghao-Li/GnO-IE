However, the specific disease is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised request, I am assuming that the \"Disease\" category includes not only specific diseases but also conditions that can lead to diseases. Therefore, I have identified \"familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\" as the disease entity in the paragraph.\n\nThe paragraph mentions an isoleucine-to-lysine polymorphism at codon 1307 (I1307K) of the APC gene, which is a genetic mutation associated with an increased risk of developing familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is a rare inherited condition that causes hundreds to thousands of polyps to form in the colon and rectum, which can lead to colorectal cancer if left untreated."}
