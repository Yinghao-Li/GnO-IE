In the given paragraph, the term \"Wilms tumor 1\" is the only disease-related entity mentioned. It is a childhood kidney cancer, and the gene responsible for it is being discussed in the context of mammalian gonadogenesis. Therefore, the valid disease entity is \"Wilms tumor 1.\" The other term, \"steroidogenic factor 1,\" is a gene and not a disease, so it is not included in the table."}
