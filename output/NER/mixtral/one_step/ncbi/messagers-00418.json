FGFR3 P250R mutation: This is a genetic mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene, which can lead to diseases such as achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism.\n2. FGFR2 VV269 - 270 deletion: This is a genetic mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene, which can be associated with various medical conditions, such as Apert syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, and Pfeiffer syndrome.\n\nBoth FGFR3 P250R mutation and FGFR2 VV269 - 270 deletion are specific genetic mutations that can lead to various diseases, so they are considered \"Disease\" entities in this context."},
