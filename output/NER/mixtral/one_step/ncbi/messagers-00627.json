However, there is a mention of the \"VLCAD gene\". VLCAD stands for Very Long Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase, which is a type of enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism. Deficiency of this enzyme can lead to a rare genetic disorder called \"Very Long Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency\" (VLCADD). Therefore, I have included \"VLCAD gene\" as a \"Disease\" entity in the table."},
