However, the paragraph only mentions the \"ARSA enzyme activity\" and the \"R496H mutation\". The ARSA enzyme activity is not a disease itself, but rather a measurement of the enzyme's activity level. Therefore, it should not be included as a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"R496H mutation\" is a genetic mutation, but it is not clear from the paragraph whether it is associated with any specific disease or medical condition. Therefore, it is also not appropriate to include it as a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nAs a result, the markdown table above contains no rows, as there are no clear \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph."}
