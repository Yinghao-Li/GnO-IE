However, there are two genetic mutations mentioned - I113F and T312S. Genetic mutations can be associated with various diseases, but without additional context, it's impossible to determine the specific diseases associated with these mutations. Therefore, I have listed the mutations as the \"Disease\" entities in the table."},
