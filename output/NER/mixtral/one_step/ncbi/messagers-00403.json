The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"RNAs\", \"expanded allele\", \"gain-of-function mutation\", \"inappropriate binding\", \"proteins\", and \"CUG repeats\" are not diseases, but rather components or processes related to the disease. Therefore, the table above only includes the disease entity \"DM\"."}
