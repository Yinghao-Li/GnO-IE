However, the text refers to a \"nonsense mutation\" in the gene of certain affected individuals in a family. The specific gene is not mentioned by name, but the mutation is described as producing a stop signal in codon 82 (Glu) of NPII. Therefore, I have listed \"NPII\" as the disease entity, as it is the only potential disease-related term mentioned in the text. However, it is important to note that NPII is not typically considered a disease, but rather a protein."},
