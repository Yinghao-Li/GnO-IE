    {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"Disease\" entities in the following paragraph. Please present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\". Make sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: The follow - up observation of an identical and unique pattern of progressive bone dysplasia in the two patients ( one with SJS type 2 , one with SWS ) surviving beyond infancy adds to the evidence in favor of identity .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| SJS type 2 |\n| SWS |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* SJS type 2 refers to Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare and serious skin condition typically caused by a reaction to medication.\n* SWS stands for Sturge-Weber syndrome, a neurological disorder present at birth that affects the brain and skin.\n\nBoth SJS type 2 and SWS are unique diseases, and the mention of these conditions in the paragraph indicates that they are the \"Disease\" entities."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Please remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" and present the valid entities as a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\".\n\nMake sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Progressive bone dysplasia |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The only entity in the paragraph that clearly refers to a \"Disease\" is \"progressive bone dysplasia,\" which is a medical condition affecting bone growth and development.\n* The other entities, \"SJS type 2\" and \"SWS,\" are not explicitly referred to as diseases in the paragraph, but they are medical conditions, and it is reasonable to infer that they are being discussed as diseases in the context of the paragraph. However, since the prompt specifies to remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease,\" I have excluded them from the table."}
