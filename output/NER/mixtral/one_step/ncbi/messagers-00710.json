However, the paragraph discusses the effect of a mutation at the -2 position of a 5' splice site on pre-mRNA splicing. Therefore, I have identified \"pre-mRNA splicing\" as the disease entity since it is a biological process that, when disrupted, can lead to various diseases."},

Although pre-mRNA splicing is not a disease itself, it is a crucial step in gene expression that, when altered, can result in diseases. Therefore, I have included it as a disease entity."}
