    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| inactivation (when referring to the sodium channels) |\n\nThe text mentions two issues with the sodium channels: one is that they recover from inactivation more rapidly than normal, and the other is that a frameshift mutation causes the sodium channel to be non-functional. However, these are not considered diseases in themselves but rather as potential factors contributing to certain medical conditions. Therefore, I am not identifying any specific diseases in this paragraph. The term \"inactivation\" is used in the context of the sodium channels' functioning, not as a disease."},
