It is characterized by the breakdown of a fatty substance called myelin, which insulates nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.\n* Deficient arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) activity is a characteristic feature of metachromatic leukodystrophy, which leads to the accumulation of sulfatides in the nervous system, causing damage to the myelin sheath.\n\nNote: I have not included \"fatal at age 5 years\" and \"increased galactosylsulfatide ( GS ) excretion\" as Disease entities, as they are not diseases but rather consequences or symptoms of the disease or related biochemical abnormalities."},
