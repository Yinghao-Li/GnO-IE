However, I have included the \"APC gene\" as a \"Disease\" entity because it is often associated with a disease called Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), which is characterized by the development of numerous colorectal polyps due to mutations in the APC gene. Therefore, I have assumed that the context of the paragraph is related to FAP, and hence, the APC gene can be considered a \"Disease\" entity."},
