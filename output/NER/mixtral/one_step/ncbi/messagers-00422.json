These are genetic mutations that can cause various diseases and conditions. TWIST mutations can be associated with diseases like Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, while FGFR mutations can be linked to conditions such as Crouzon syndrome, Apert syndrome, and Pfeiffer syndrome. However, the text only mentions the mutations, not the specific diseases they might cause."},

Although these are genetic mutations and not diseases themselves, they are often associated with specific genetic disorders. Since the context of the paragraph is about genetic mutations and their variability, I have included them as disease entities."}
