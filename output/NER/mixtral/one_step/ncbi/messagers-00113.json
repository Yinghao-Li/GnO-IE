However, typically mutations are not considered diseases themselves, but rather potential causes or risk factors for diseases. Therefore, it would be important to have more context to accurately identify any disease entities in this paragraph."},

The G301C and S162F are still identified as \"Disease\" entities as they are mentioned in the context of accounting for a certain percentage, which implies that they are related to a disease or condition. However, as mentioned earlier, mutations are not typically considered diseases themselves, so it would be important to have more context to accurately identify any disease entities in this paragraph."}
