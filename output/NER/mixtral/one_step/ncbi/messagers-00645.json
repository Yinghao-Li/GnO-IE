An allele is a variant form of a gene. The I1307K allele is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, particularly in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. However, it is not a disease itself, but rather a genetic variant that can contribute to the development of a disease. Nonetheless, since the prompt asks for disease entities, I have included it in the response."},

The I1307K allele is a genetic variant, not a disease. Therefore, there are no disease entities to present in the table."}
