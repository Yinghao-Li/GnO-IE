PAH deficiency: This is a disease entity as it refers to a specific medical condition where the body lacks or has reduced levels of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), an enzyme responsible for breaking down the amino acid phenylalanine.\n2. PAH - mutation genotype: This is also a disease entity as it refers to a genetic mutation that affects the PAH gene, which can lead to PAH deficiency."},
