These deletions are referred to as \"4649delA in exon 33\" and \"7883del5 in exon 55\". Therefore, I have identified these two entities as \"Disease\" for the purpose of this task. However, it's important to note that the context of these deletions and their specific impact on human health is not provided in the paragraph, so further research would be needed to determine if they are indeed associated with any known diseases."},
