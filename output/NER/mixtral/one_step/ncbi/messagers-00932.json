Therefore, \"breast carcinomas\" is the disease entity in this paragraph. The term \"loss\" can be associated with a disease, but it is not a disease itself. Similarly, \"high-grade\" is a description of the severity of the disease, not a disease entity. Therefore, these terms are not included in the table."}
