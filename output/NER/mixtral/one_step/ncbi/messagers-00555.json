Haploinsufficiency refers to a genetic condition where a person has only one functional copy of a gene instead of the usual two copies. In this case, the gene in question is located in the distal part of the short arm of chromosome 3, hence \"distal 3 p\"."},

The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"45 chromosomes\" and \"derivative 3\", are genetic features or abnormalities, but they are not diseases in themselves. Therefore, only \"haploinsufficiency of distal 3 p\" is included in the table as a valid disease entity."}
