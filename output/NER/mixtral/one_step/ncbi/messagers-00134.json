Congenital refers to a condition that is present from birth, and DM stands for myotonic dystrophy, which is a genetic disorder that affects muscle function. Therefore, \"congenital DM\" refers to the congenital form of myotonic dystrophy."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| congenital DM |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only clear disease entity is \"congenital DM\". The other term, \"paternal transmission,\" refers to the way in which a genetic disorder is passed down from parent to child, rather than the disease itself. Therefore, \"paternal transmission\" is not a disease entity and is not included in the table."}
