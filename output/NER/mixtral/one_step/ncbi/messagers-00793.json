    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| single-nucleotide events (if considered as a genetic disease) |\n| deletions (if considered as a genetic disease) |\n| substitutions (if considered as a genetic disease) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"single-nucleotide events\", \"deletions\", and \"substitutions\" are molecular defects that can lead to genetic diseases if they occur in certain regions of the genome. However, they are not diseases in themselves.\n* \"splice sites\" and \"codons\" are molecular regions or units that, when altered, can lead to abnormal RNA processing or protein synthesis, respectively, and potentially to disease. However, they are not diseases in themselves.\n* Therefore, I have added a qualification to the first three entities to indicate that they can be considered as genetic diseases if they occur in certain contexts."}
