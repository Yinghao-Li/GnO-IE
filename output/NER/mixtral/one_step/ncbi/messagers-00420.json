TWIST is a gene associated with a rare genetic disorder called Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. However, the paragraph only mentions \"mutations\" in the TWIST gene, not the actual disease itself. Nonetheless, I have included it in the table as it is still related to a genetic condition."},

Although \"mutations\" are not diseases themselves, they are closely related to genetic disorders. In this context, TWIST mutations refer to genetic changes in the TWIST gene, which can lead to diseases like Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Therefore, I have kept \"TWIST mutations\" in the table as a disease-related entity."}
