However, it is important to note that the mutation itself is not a disease but a genetic variation that can contribute to the development of a disease. Nonetheless, for the purpose of this task, I have identified \"Cys282Tyr mutation\" as a disease entity, as requested."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n\nExplanation:\n\nUpon closer examination, there are no clear disease entities mentioned in the paragraph. The only entity mentioned, \"Cys282Tyr mutation,\" is a genetic variation that can contribute to the development of certain diseases, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, there are no valid disease entities to present in a table format."}
