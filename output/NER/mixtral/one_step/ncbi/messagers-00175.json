The term \"DM\" in \"DM CTG repeat\" is an abbreviation for \"myotonic dystrophy\" and is therefore not considered a separate disease entity. The term \"CTG repeat\" refers to a genetic characteristic of myotonic dystrophy and is not a disease entity. The term \"clinical severity\" is a general term used to describe the severity of a disease and is not a disease entity. The term \"repeat length changes\" is a description of a genetic characteristic of myotonic dystrophy and is not a disease entity. The term \"varying clinical severity\" is a description of the severity of myotonic dystrophy and is not a disease entity. The term \"CTG repeat size\" is a description of a genetic characteristic of myotonic dystrophy and is not a disease entity. The term \"time intervals\" is a general term used to describe a period of time and is not a disease entity."}
