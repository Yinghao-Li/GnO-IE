However, it is important to note that \"DMPK\" is actually a gene, specifically the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene. It is not a disease itself, but mutations in this gene are associated with certain diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy type 1. Therefore, the labeling of \"DMPK\" as a \"Disease\" entity might be a misunderstanding or a mistake in the original paragraph."},

While \"DMPK\" is a gene associated with certain diseases, it is not a disease itself. Therefore, there are no valid \"Disease\" entities to present in a table."}
