MLH1 is a gene associated with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and other types of cancer. However, the specific term \"MLH1 mutation\" is the only direct mention of a disease-related entity in the paragraph. Therefore, the valid entity to extract is \"MLH1 mutation\"."},

Although \"MLH1 mutation\" is a genetic mutation, it is a disease-causing mutation. Therefore, it is appropriate to include it as a disease entity. There are no other disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."}
