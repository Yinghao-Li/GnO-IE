DMD stands for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, which is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness due to the lack of dystrophin protein. The analysis of the dystrophin gene is performed to define the localization of deletions and duplications in relation to the different DMD promoters."},

The other entities such as \"deletions\", \"duplications\", and \"promoters\" are genetic terms that do not refer to a disease. Therefore, the valid entity is \"DMD\", which is presented in the Markdown table."}
