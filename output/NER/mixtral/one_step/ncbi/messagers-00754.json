Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer: This is a type of colon cancer that is inherited and not associated with polyps.\n2. I1307K APC mutations: APC is a gene associated with familial adenomatous polyposis, a type of colon cancer. I1307K is a specific mutation in the APC gene.\n3. hMLH1 mutations: hMLH1 is a gene that helps repair mistakes in DNA. Mutations in this gene can lead to Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of colon cancer."},
