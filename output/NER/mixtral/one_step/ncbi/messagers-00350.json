However, there is a reference to a \"missense mutation, a splice-donor mutation, and a frameshift mutation in the coding region of SCN5A.\" SCN5A is a gene that encodes the alpha subunit of the cardiac sodium channel, and mutations in this gene can lead to various cardiac arrhythmias and diseases such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and cardiac conduction disease. Therefore, I have listed SCN5A as the \"Disease\" entity in this case, even though it is technically a gene and not a disease."},
