However, it does not specify the exact name of the disease. The only other disease mentioned is \"ADNDI,\" which is an abbreviation for \"Autosomal Dominant Neurohypophyseal Diabetes Insipidus.\" Therefore, I have included both of these terms in the table as potential \"Disease\" entities."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| ADNDI |\n\nIn the revised table, I have removed the term \"the disease\" since it is too vague and does not clearly refer to a specific medical condition. The only remaining disease entity is \"ADNDI,\" which is an abbreviation for \"Autosomal Dominant Neurohypophyseal Diabetes Insipidus.\" This term is mentioned specifically in the paragraph as a genetic disorder that is associated with mutations in the AVP-NPII gene. Therefore, it is a clear and valid \"Disease\" entity."}
