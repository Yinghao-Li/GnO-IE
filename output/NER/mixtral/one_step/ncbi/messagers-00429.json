However, the text does not explicitly mention any specific diseases. Therefore, I made an inference based on the context that the mutations described could potentially lead to a disorder related to the UBE3A protein."},

The only possible disease-related entity is the UBE3A protein, which is associated with certain genetic disorders. However, the text does not specify any particular disease. Therefore, I have kept the same inferred disease entity as before."}
