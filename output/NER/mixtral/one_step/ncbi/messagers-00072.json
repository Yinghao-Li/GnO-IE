However, there are two protein/gene names mentioned - BARD1 and BRCA1. Among these, BRCA1 is associated with certain types of cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancers. Therefore, I have included BRCA1 as a \"Disease\" entity in the table. However, it's important to note that BRCA1 is not a disease itself, but a genetic mutation in the BRCA1 gene can increase the risk of developing certain types of cancers."},
