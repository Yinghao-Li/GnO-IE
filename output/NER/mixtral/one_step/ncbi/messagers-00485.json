It is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and is characterized by the accumulation of a particular type of fatty substance called gangliosides in the body's cells. The disease is caused by a mutation in the HEXA gene, which is responsible for producing an enzyme that helps break down gangliosides. The paragraph mentions a proband who manifested a subacute variant of this disease, indicating that the individual displayed symptoms of the disorder."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| G (M2) gangliosidosis |\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only disease entity mentioned is \"G (M2) gangliosidosis\". The other terms mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"subacute variant\" and \"1422 G - - > C ( amino acid W474C ) substitution in the first position of exon 13 of HEXA\" are not diseases themselves, but rather describe the manifestation or genetic mutation associated with the disease. Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"G (M2) gangliosidosis\"."}
