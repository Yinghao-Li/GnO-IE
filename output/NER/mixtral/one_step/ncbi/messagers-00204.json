The other terms in the paragraph, such as \"786 - 0 cell line\" and \"cell cycle,\" do not refer to diseases. The 786 - 0 cell line is a specific type of cell, and the cell cycle is a biological process that cells undergo as they grow and divide. Therefore, these terms are not included in the table."}
