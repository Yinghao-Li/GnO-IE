The term \"the disease\" is referring to \"AS\", so it is also included as a valid entity. The term \"genetically determined\" is related to the genetic predisposition of the disease, and \"environmental trigger\" is related to the environmental factors that may cause the disease, but neither of them are diseases themselves."}
