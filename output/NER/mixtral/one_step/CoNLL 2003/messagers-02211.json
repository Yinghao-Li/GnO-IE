    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Person |\n| --- |\n| head of the existing inquiry |\n\nNote: In the original paragraph, \"Australian opposition\" and \"federal court\" are not clearly \"Person\" entities. \"Australian opposition\" generally refers to a political group rather than an individual person, and \"federal court\" is an institution rather than a person. Therefore, I have removed them from the list of valid entities. However, \"head of the existing inquiry\" is likely to refer to a specific person, so I have kept it in the list."}

The only clear \"Location\" entity in the paragraph is the \"Australian diplomatic service,\" which refers to a specific location within the country where the alleged wrongdoing took place."}
