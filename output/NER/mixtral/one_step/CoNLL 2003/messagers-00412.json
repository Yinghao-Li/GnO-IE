I misunderstood the prompt and provided both team names as location entities. However, upon closer examination, neither \"Phoenix\" nor \"ST LOUIS\" clearly refer to a location in the given paragraph. Instead, they refer to the teams playing in the game. Since the prompt asks for location entities, I have removed both entities from the table.\n\nAs there are no clear location entities in the given paragraph, I cannot provide a valid Markdown table for this prompt."}

However, since the prompt asks for organization entities, I will assume that these are the intended entities and present them as before."}
