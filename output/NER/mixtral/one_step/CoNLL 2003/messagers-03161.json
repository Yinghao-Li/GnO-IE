In this case, it is a participant in the qualifier match, which warrants its identification as a Person entity."},

It is mentioned as the opponent of Albania in a football match, but it is not explicitly stated that it is a national football team or any other type of organization. Therefore, the only clear \"Organization\" entity in the paragraph is \"FIFA\"."}
