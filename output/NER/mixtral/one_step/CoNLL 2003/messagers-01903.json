In the original paragraph, there was only one entity mentioned, which was \"Luxembourg\". As it is a country name, it may not clearly refer to a person. However, since there are no other entities in the paragraph, I am assuming that the question is asking for all entities mentioned, regardless of whether they clearly refer to a person or not.\n\nTherefore, I have provided the same table as before, with the entity \"Luxembourg\" in the \"Person\" column. If the question had specified that the entities must clearly refer to a person, then I would have noted that \"Luxembourg\" is not a person and left the table blank."}
