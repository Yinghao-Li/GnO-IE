Although Syria is typically a country and not a person, I have included it in the table because in some contexts it can refer to the government or military forces of that country, which can be considered a person-like entity. However, upon further review, I realize that the context of the paragraph does not provide enough information to determine whether \"Syria\" is being used as a person-like entity or as a country. Therefore, I must retract the previous table, as it does not meet the criteria of clearly referring to a \"Person\" entity.\n\nAfter careful re-examination, I have determined that there are no clear \"Person\" entities in the paragraph. Therefore, I cannot provide a table of person entities for this paragraph."}
