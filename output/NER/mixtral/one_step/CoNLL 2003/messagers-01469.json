The other entity, \"Congress\", is a general term that can refer to a legislative body or a group of people who come together to make decisions. However, in this context, it is clear that \"Congress\" refers to the Chilean Congress, as it is preceded by the possessive adjective \"Chilean\". Therefore, \"Congress\" is included in the table as \"Chilean Congress\"."}
