However, it's important to note that this is not an organization in the strict sense, but rather a position held by an individual. Therefore, it's not a perfect match for the \"Organization\" entity type. The other named entity \"Belo\" is assumed to be a person or event, not an organization, and is therefore not included in the table."},

This is because it refers to a group of individuals representing a country (Indonesia) in a diplomatic capacity in another country (Norway). It is a well-defined organization with a clear structure and purpose, and is therefore a valid \"Organization\" entity."}
