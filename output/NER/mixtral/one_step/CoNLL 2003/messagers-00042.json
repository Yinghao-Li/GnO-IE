After reevaluating the paragraph, I realized that there are no clear \"Person\" entities mentioned. The only entity mentioned is \"Japan,\" which typically refers to a country, not an individual person. I included it in the previous response due to the context of sports, but upon further reflection, I believe it is more appropriate to not include any entities in this case."}
