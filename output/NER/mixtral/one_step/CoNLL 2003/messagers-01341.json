However, since the paragraph does not provide enough context to determine a precise location, I included it as a location entity based on the possibility of it referring to the Clinton Presidential Library or another location associated with Bill Clinton. \"President Boris Yeltsin\" refers to the former President of Russia, and thus is a location entity in the context of the Russian government."},
