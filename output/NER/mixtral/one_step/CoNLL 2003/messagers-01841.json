The entity \"U.N.\" could be considered a \"Person\" in some contexts, but in this paragraph, it is used as an abbreviation for the United Nations, which is an organization, not a person. Therefore, it is not included in the table. Similarly, \"U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping\", \"U.N. special envoy for Burundi\", \"U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95\", and \"secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference\" are not \"Person\" entities, but rather roles or titles held by the individuals listed."}
