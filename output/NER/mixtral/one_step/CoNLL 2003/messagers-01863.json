In the original paragraph, there are only two entities mentioned - the \"fiery politician\" and \"AN\". The \"fiery politician\" is a person and not an organization, so it should be removed from the list of entities. Therefore, the only valid entity that clearly refers to an \"Organization\" is \"AN\"."}
