This is because an assembly refers to a group of people who gather to make decisions or discuss matters. In this case, the assembly is of the Senate, which is a group of elected officials who come together to form a legislative body. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider \"the full assembly of the Senate\" as a single entity representing a group of people."},
