It is a professional football club based in Udine, Italy, that competes in Serie A, the top flight of Italian football. The context of the sentence suggests that Oliver Bierhoff is a player for Udinese, and the fact that he is injured is good news for Milan, which is likely a reference to AC Milan, another Italian football club.

Therefore, these entities are not included in the table."}
