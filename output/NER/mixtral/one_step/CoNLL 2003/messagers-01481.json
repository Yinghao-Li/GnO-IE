Similarly, the \"news conference caller\" could be a specific person, and the \"attendees\" of the OIC meeting would also be considered people. Finally, I included \"Jakarta\" as a person since it is a city and some cultures and languages consider cities to be \"persons\" or entities with their own identity and agency."},
