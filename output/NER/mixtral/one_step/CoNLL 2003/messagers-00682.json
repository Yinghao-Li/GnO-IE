After reevaluating the paragraph, I still consider these to be the only entities that can be classified as organizations, as they are the names of sports clubs. However, I would like to point out that \"Schalke 2\" might be an abbreviated form of the organization's name, and it would be more appropriate to refer to it as \"Schalke 04\" (often abbreviated as Schalke or S04), which is the full name of the German sports club."}
