While it is true that \"Damascus\" is commonly known as the capital city of Syria, in this context, it is used metonymically to refer to the government or authorities of the city or country. Metonymy is a figure of speech where a thing or concept is referred to by the name of something closely associated with that thing or concept. In this case, the government or authorities are closely associated with the city or capital. Therefore, \"Damascus\" is identified as a \"Person\" entity."}
