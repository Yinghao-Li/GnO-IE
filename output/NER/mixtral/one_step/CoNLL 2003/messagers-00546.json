While \"NY Jets\" can be interpreted as a location (the team's home stadium), it is more commonly referred to as a sports team. However, since the prompt asks for location entities, I have included it in the table. Similarly, \"New England\" is a region, but in the context of the paragraph, it's likely that it's referring to the New England Patriots, an American football team that plays in Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts. Therefore, I have included it in the table as well."}
