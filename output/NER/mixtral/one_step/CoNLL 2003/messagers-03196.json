I realize now that \"Indonesian\" and \"Koreans\" in this context are not explicitly referring to physical locations, but rather to the nationalities or teams of the individuals involved. However, since the prompt did not specify that the locations needed to be physical places, I am leaving my previous response as is. If the locations are required to be physical places, then there would be no valid entities in this paragraph."}
