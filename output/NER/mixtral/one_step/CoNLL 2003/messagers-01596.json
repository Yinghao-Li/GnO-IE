In this context, it is being used to refer to the Jewish state, which is a person (government with the ability to demand).\n* \"Lahd\" is a proper noun and likely refers to a person, although more context is needed to determine their exact identity.\n* \"SLA\" is an acronym that stands for \"South Lebanon Army,\" which is a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force.
