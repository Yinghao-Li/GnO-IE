However, the prompt asks to remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Location\". Since \"cities\" is not the focus of the paragraph and is only mentioned in relation to the migrant workers, it may not be a clear reference to \"Location\". Therefore, I have removed \"cities\" and only included \"home villages\" as a valid entity, which is the location where the migrant workers are flocking back to."}
