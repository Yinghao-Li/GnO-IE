The term \"rebels\" is a collective noun referring to a group of people, but it is not a proper noun and does not clearly refer to a specific individual, so it is not included in the table. Similarly, \"the Rwandan refugees\" is a group of people, but it is not a proper noun and does not clearly refer to specific individuals, so it is not included in the table."}

Therefore, I have removed it from the list of \"Organization\" entities."}
