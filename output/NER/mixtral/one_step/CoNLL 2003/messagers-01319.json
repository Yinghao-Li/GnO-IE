Similarly, \"Duma deputies\" refers to members of the State Duma, the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, but it is not clear whether they are being referred to as an organization or as a group of individuals. Therefore, only \"Norilsk\" is included in the table as a valid \"Organization\" entity."}
