However, it is more likely that \"PT Tambang Timah\" is a company name, as it is a common practice to use \"PT\" as an abbreviation for \"Perseroan Terbatas\" which means \"limited liability company\" in Indonesian. Therefore, it is not a clear reference to a \"Person\" and could be excluded from the list of entities. In this case, I would recommend reviewing the source of the paragraph to determine the correct context and interpretation of \"PT Tambang Timah\"."}
