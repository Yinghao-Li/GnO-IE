Therefore, there is no need to remove any entities, and the valid entity can be presented as a Markdown table with one column \"Organization\" as follows:\n\n| Organization |\n| --- |\n| Australian child-sex inquiry |\n\nNote that \"court\" is not included as an organization in this case because it is not clear from the paragraph which court is being referred to. Additionally, \"head\" is not included as an organization because it refers to a person, not an organization."}
