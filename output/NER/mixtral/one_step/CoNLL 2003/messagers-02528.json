I understand now that you want to extract organizations from the paragraph even if they are not explicitly labeled as such. Here's the corrected response:\n\nParagraph: 10. United States 164\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are no clear \"Organization\" entities. The only text present is a number (10), a country name (United States), and another number (164). Therefore, I cannot provide a table with \"Organization\" entities in this case.\n\nHere's the table with the header \"Organization\" but no rows for entities:\n\n| Organization |\n| --- |\n\nPlease provide a new paragraph for analysis if you would like to identify \"Organization\" entities."}
