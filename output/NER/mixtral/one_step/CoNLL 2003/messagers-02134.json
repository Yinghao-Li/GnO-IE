The \"independence march\" does not refer to a specific person, and \"Venice\" and the \"Po River\" are place names, not person names. The only possible person entity is the \"self-styled 'Republic of Padania'\", but it is unclear whether this refers to a person or a group of people, and it is not explicitly named as a person. Therefore, I have included it in the table with quotation marks to indicate its ambiguity."}
