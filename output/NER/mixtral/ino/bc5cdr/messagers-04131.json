Acute tubular necrosis is a condition characterized by the death of tubular cells that make up the renal tubules in the kidneys. Ischemic origin refers to the cause of the acute tubular necrosis, which is reduced blood flow to the kidneys. Vascular-mediated damage suggests that the damage to the kidneys is caused by problems with the blood vessels supplying the kidneys."},

It is not specific to any particular cause, but in this context, it is being compared to damage caused by ischemia (restriction of blood supply).\n2. \"ischemic origin\" - This refers to a type of damage that is caused by a restriction in blood supply, leading to a lack of oxygen and nutrients in the affected tissues.\n3. \"vascular-mediated damage\" - This refers to damage that is caused by problems with the blood vessels, such as inflammation or blockages.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in this paragraph are:\n\n* non-specific acute tubular necrosis\n* ischemic origin\n* vascular-mediated damage\n\nThese entities are medical conditions or processes that involve the body's response to various chemical and biological stimuli."},
