Postzosteric trigeminal neuralgia is a type of nerve pain or disease that occurs after an outbreak of shingles (a viral infection that causes a painful rash) on the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensation in the face.\n2. Bradycardia is a disease or condition characterized by a slower-than-normal heart rate.\n3. Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that makes it difficult to pronounce words, caused by damage to the nervous system or muscles used for speaking.\n4. Dysphagia is a swallowing disorder that can be caused by damage to the nervous system, muscles, or structures involved in swallowing.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Postzosteric trigeminal neuralgia\n* Bradycardia\n* Dysarthria\n* Dysphagia"},
