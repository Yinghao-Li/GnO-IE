They are produced by the adrenal glands and play important roles in the body's \"fight or flight\" response.\n2. VIP (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide): This is a chemical that acts as a neurotransmitter and a hormone. It is involved in regulating a variety of bodily functions, including the contraction and relaxation of muscles in the gastrointestinal tract.\n3. Norepinephrine: Also known as noradrenaline, this is a chemical that functions as a hormone and a neurotransmitter.
