Research or analyze the context of these words or phrases to determine if they refer to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph \"Autoradiographic evidence of estrogen binding sites in nuclei of diethylstilbesterol induced hamster renal carcinomas,\" the potential disease-related phrases are \"estrogen binding sites,\" \"nuclei,\" and \"renal carcinomas.\"\n\nNow let's analyze the context:\n\n* \"Estrogen binding sites\" are locations in the body where estrogen (a hormone) can attach and have an effect. They are not a disease.\n* \"Nuclei\" refer to the central part of a cell containing most of the cell's genetic material. It is not a disease.\n* \"Renal carcinomas\" are a type of cancer that forms in the lining of the kidney tubules, the very small tubes in the kidney that filter waste and fluids. Therefore, \"renal carcinomas\" refers to a disease.\n\nSo, the disease entity in this paragraph is \"renal carcinomas.\""},
