While not a chemical itself, it describes the administration of the chemicals mentioned.\n2. Abecarnil: This is a benzodiazepine derivative, which acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. It is a chemical compound.\n3. Diazepam: Also known as Valium, this is a benzodiazepine medication. It is used to treat a range of conditions, including anxiety, seizures, and alcohol withdrawal. Diazepam is a chemical compound.\n4. [35S] TBPS: This is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist labeled with the radioisotope sulfur-35 ([35S]). TBPS stands for t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate. It is a chemical compound.\n5. Cerebral cortex: This is the outermost layer of the brain, responsible for higher brain functions such as consciousness, thought, and decision-making. While not a chemical, it is the location where the chemical interactions mentioned in the paragraph occur.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Abecarnil\n* Diazepam\n* [35S] TBPS\n\nThese chemicals are used in the experiment to understand their effects on GABAA receptors in the cerebral cortex of rats."},
