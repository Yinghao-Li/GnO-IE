Prostaglandin synthesis - Prostaglandins are a group of lipid compounds that are derived enzymatically from fatty acids and have diverse hormone-like effects in animals. Synthesis refers to the process of producing or manufacturing a chemical compound.\n2. Hyporeninemic - This term refers to a condition characterized by decreased levels of renin, an enzyme produced by the kidneys that plays a key role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which helps regulate blood pressure and fluid balance.\n3. Hypoaldosteronism - This is a condition characterized by low levels of aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that helps regulate sodium and potassium levels in the body, which in turn affects blood pressure and fluid balance.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are prostaglandin synthesis, renin, and aldosterone."},
