So, we can exclude this from our list.\n2. The paragraph discusses the absence of certain vesicles in the cytoplasm of surface cells. Let's examine these terms:\n * Vesicles: These are membrane-bound sacs or compartments within cells that store or transport cellular products. They can contain various substances, including chemicals. In this context, vesicles are not chemical entities but rather cellular structures that can contain chemicals.\n * Cytoplasm: This is the material within a living cell, consisting of cytosol (a jelly-like substance), organelles, and various chemicals. Here, cytoplasm is a cellular component, not a chemical entity.\n * Surface cells: These are a type of cell found on the surface of an organ or tissue. The term \"surface cells\" refers to a specific cell type and does not represent a chemical entity.\n\nBased on the paragraph, there are no specific chemical entities mentioned. The text discusses the absence of certain cellular structures (vesicles) in the cytoplasm of surface cells, but it does not specify any particular chemical substances."},
