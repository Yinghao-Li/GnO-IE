Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n\n* \"Treatment\" - This could be related to a disease, as treatment is often associated with illnesses.\n* \"Died\" - This indicates a negative health outcome, which could be related to a disease.\n* \"Bovine serum albumin (BSA)\" - This is a protein derived from cows, and it is not a disease.\n* \"Pertussis immunization\" - This is a vaccine for a disease, not the disease itself.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing context:\n\n* \"Treatment\" - In this context, \"treatment\" refers to the absence of medical intervention, which could be related to a disease. However, the text does not explicitly mention which disease the animals were suffering from.\n* \"Died\" - The animals died after being injected with BSA during pertussis immunization. This suggests that the deaths were related to the immunization process or the BSA, not a specific disease.\n\nThere are no explicit \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph. The context suggests that the animals might have been affected by a disease, but the text does not provide enough information to identify the specific disease."},
