APD: This stands for Action Potential Duration, which is a measure of the time it takes for an action potential to be generated and then return to its resting state. It is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of the effects of azimilide and dl-sotalol.\n5. EADs: This stands for Early Afterdepolarizations, which are abnormal electrical signals that can occur in the heart. It is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of the effects of azimilide.\n6. TDR: This stands for Transmural Dispersion of Repolarization, which is a measure of the variation in the time it takes for different parts of the heart muscle to recover after an action potential.
