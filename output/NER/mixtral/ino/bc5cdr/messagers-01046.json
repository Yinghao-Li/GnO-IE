Research or use knowledge of medical terminology to determine if the terms are associated with a disease.\n3. In the given paragraph, the terms \"GAP43\" and \"Pilo\" do not directly refer to diseases. However, the context suggests that there is a loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP-43, which could potentially be associated with a disease state.\n4. The term \"loss\" implies a negative change in the system being studied, which might be related to a disease.
