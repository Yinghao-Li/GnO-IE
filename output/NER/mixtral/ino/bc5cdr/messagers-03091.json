DOX: DOX is an abbreviation for Doxorubicin, a chemotherapy drug used to treat various cancers, but it is not a disease.\n3. STAT3: STAT3 is a protein involved in various cellular processes, but it is not a disease.\n4. MHC: MHC stands for Major Histocompatibility Complex, a group of proteins responsible for the immune system's response to foreign substances, but it is not a disease.\n5. CB7: CB7 is a protein that forms a complex with Ku70 and Ku80, but it is not a disease.\n6. Ku70 and Ku80: Ku70 and Ku80 are DNA repair proteins, but they are not diseases.\n\nSince none of the entities in the paragraph clearly refer to a disease, there are no entities to keep after removing the irrelevant ones."},
