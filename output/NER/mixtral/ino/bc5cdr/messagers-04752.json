UPDRS scores: The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a tool used to measure the severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms. While UPDRS is not a disease itself, it is used to assess the severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms, so it is relevant to the context of the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are bradykinesia, rigidity, and Parkinson's disease (implied by the mention of UPDRS scores)."},
