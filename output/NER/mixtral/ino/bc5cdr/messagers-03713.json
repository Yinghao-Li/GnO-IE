Let's analyze the context to ensure these entities can be classified as diseases:\n * Convulsions: A convulsion is a series of violent, involuntary muscle contractions. While not a disease itself, it can be a symptom of various medical conditions, such as epilepsy or meningitis. However, in this context, it is used to describe a specific reaction to monosodium glutamate administration in neonatal rodents.\n4. Since the context does not imply that the convulsions are a symptom of a specific disease, we will not classify it as a disease entity in this case.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the provided paragraph."},
