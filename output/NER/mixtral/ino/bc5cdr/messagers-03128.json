It works by preventing the thyroid gland from producing excess thyroid hormones.\n4. Hepatocellular necrosis: This is a serious medical condition characterized by the death of liver cells. It can be caused by various factors, including viral infections, toxins, and certain medications.\n5. Lupus-like syndrome: This is a medical condition that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that can affect various organs and tissues in the body. In this case, the lupus-like syndrome is associated with the use of propylthiouracil.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are propylthiouracil, hepatitis, methimazole, and lupus-like syndrome."},
