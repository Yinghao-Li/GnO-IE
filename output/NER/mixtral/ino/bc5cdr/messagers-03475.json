It is a pharmacological concept.\n2. Systemic: This term does not directly refer to a chemical but rather a route of administration where the drug is absorbed and distributed throughout the body.\n3. High dose inhaled salbutamol: Here, we have three chemical entities:\n * High dose: This is a quantitative term and not a chemical entity.\n * Inhaled: This term refers to the route of administration, not a chemical entity.\n * Salbutamol: This is the primary chemical entity in the paragraph. It is a medication used to treat asthma and other lung conditions. Its chemical name is albuterol.\n4. Asthmatics: This term refers to individuals suffering from asthma, a chronic respiratory disease, and is not a chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is salbutamol (albuterol)."},
