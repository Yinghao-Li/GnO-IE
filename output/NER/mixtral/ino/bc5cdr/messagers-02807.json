Cholestatic presentation: This refers to a condition where there is reduced bile flow, leading to the accumulation of bile salts and bilirubin in the liver. It is a symptom or manifestation of various diseases, but in this context, it is associated with a specific cause - yellow phosphorus poisoning.\n2. Yellow phosphorus poisoning: This is a disease entity, as it refers to the condition resulting from the ingestion or exposure to a toxic substance called yellow phosphorus.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
