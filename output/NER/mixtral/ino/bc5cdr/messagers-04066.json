Analyze the terms and determine if they are being used as a disease or a non-disease term.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential medical conditions or diseases are:\n\n* Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation\n* Accelerated junctional rhythms\n\nTo confirm if these terms are being used as diseases, let's consider their meanings:\n\n* Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation: This refers to a situation when the atria and ventricles in the heart beat independently, without a regular relationship between them. This is considered an abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia, which is a disease condition.\n* Accelerated junctional rhythms: This refers to an abnormally fast heart rhythm originating from the junctional area (AV node) of the heart. It is also considered an arrhythmia, which is a disease condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation\n2. Accelerated junctional rhythms"},
