Pharmacological: While not a chemical itself, this term refers to the branch of science that deals with the study of the interactions between chemicals and living organisms.\n2. Characteristics: This is a general term and does not refer to any specific chemical.\n3. Galenic formulation: This term refers to a type of pharmaceutical preparation method named after Galen, an ancient Greek physician. It does not directly refer to a specific chemical, but rather a process or method related to chemicals.\n4. Propofol: This is the primary chemical entity in the paragraph. It is a short-acting general anesthetic used in procedures such as induction and maintenance of anesthesia, and sedation for mechanically ventilated adults.\n5. Soyabean oil: This is another chemical entity in the paragraph. It is a common solvent for propofol, but in this case, it is specified as not being present in the new formulation.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are propofol and soyabean oil."},
