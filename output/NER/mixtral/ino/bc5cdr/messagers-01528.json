Analyze the paragraph and highlight the disease entities.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are no specific diseases mentioned. However, there are references to medical conditions or health-related concepts:\n\n* BCNU: This is an abbreviation for a chemotherapy drug called Carmustine, which is used to treat various types of cancer.\n* Malondialdehyde: This is a naturally occurring compound in the body, but increased levels can indicate oxidative stress, which is associated with various diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n* Superoxide dismutase: This is an enzyme that helps break down potentially harmful oxygen molecules in cells, which is important for preventing damage to tissues. Lower levels of this enzyme can be associated with certain diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn summary, while there are no specific diseases mentioned in the paragraph, there are references to medical conditions or health-related concepts, including BCNU exposure, malondialdehyde levels, and superoxide dismutase levels."},
