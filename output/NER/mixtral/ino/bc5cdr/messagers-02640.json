Chemotherapy\n\nExplanation:\n- The term \"recent\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a time specifier.\n- The abbreviation \"CIN\" (Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is not a chemical entity, but a medical condition.\n- The number \"4 . 5\" is a numerical value and not a chemical entity.\n- The term \"patients\" refers to a group of individuals under medical treatment, not a chemical entity.\n- The term \"cancer\" is a medical condition and not a chemical entity.\n- The term \"developed\" refers to a process or event, not a chemical entity.\n\nHence, the only relevant chemical entity in the paragraph is \"chemotherapy.\""},
