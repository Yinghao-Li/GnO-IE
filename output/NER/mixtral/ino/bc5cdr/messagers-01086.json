Therefore, \"cholestatic\" can also be considered a \"chemical\" entity in the context of the given paragraph.\n3. Mixed: While \"mixed\" is not a chemical entity on its own, it is used here in conjunction with \"laboratory criteria\" to describe a type of liver damage that has both hepatocellular and cholestatic features. Therefore, \"mixed\" can be considered a \"chemical\" entity in the context of the given paragraph.\n\nTo summarize, the \"chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* Hepatocellular\n* Cholestatic\n* Mixed (when used in the context of liver damage with both hepatocellular and cholestatic features)"},
