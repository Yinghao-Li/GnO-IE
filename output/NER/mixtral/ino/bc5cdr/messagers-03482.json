It is a common measurement in spirometry.\n2. FEF25-75: Forced Expiratory Flow at 25-75% of the FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) is a measure of the average rate of airflow during the middle portion of a forced expiratory maneuver.\n3. HDS: It is not clear from the context what HDS stands for, but based on the context it seems to be a treatment or drug that is being administered to the subjects in the study.\n4. DRC: Dose-Response Curve is a graphical representation of the change in response of a system to a change in the stimulus (dose).\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are not explicitly mentioned, but HDS could potentially be a chemical or drug, and FEV1 and FEF25-75 are measurements related to lung function that can be affected by chemical exposures or treatments."},
