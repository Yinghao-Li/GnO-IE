Analyze each potential entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text:\n\n* serum\n* proteins\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each potential entity:\n\n* serum: Serum is a yellowish fluid that is derived from blood plasma after clotting factors have been removed. It is a complex mixture of various substances, including proteins, hormones, electrolytes, antibodies, and enzymes. Since serum is a bodily fluid that contains various chemicals, it is considered a chemical entity in this context.\n* proteins: Proteins are large biomolecules consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. They are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's tissues and organs. Proteins are classified as chemicals, so \"proteins\" is a chemical entity in this context.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. serum\n2. proteins"},
