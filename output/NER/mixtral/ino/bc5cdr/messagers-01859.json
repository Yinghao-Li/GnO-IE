Plasma: This is the liquid component of blood in which cells and other particles are suspended.\n5. Bile flow rate: This is a measure of the amount of bile produced by the liver.\n6. Neutrophil sequestration: This refers to the process by which neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, become trapped within the liver.\n7. Liver: This is an organ that plays a key role in metabolism, detoxification, and the production of biochemicals necessary for digestion.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hepatocellular enzyme\n* Plasma\n* Bile\n* Neutrophils (although not explicitly mentioned, they are implied in the term \"neutrophil sequestration\")\n* Liver (although not a chemical, it is a biological tissue where many chemical reactions take place)."},
