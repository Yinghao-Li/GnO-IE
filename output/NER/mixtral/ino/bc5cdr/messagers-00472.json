In this context, leukocyturia is mentioned as having disappeared within 3 months, implying that it was a condition the patient had.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Leukocyturia"},

Urine albumin/creatinine ratios: Both albumin and creatinine are chemical substances found in the urine. Albumin is a protein, and creatinine is a waste product, as mentioned earlier.\n3. Leukocyturia: This term refers to the presence of white blood cells (leukocytes) in the urine. White blood cells are chemical entities, being a type of cell in the human body.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are serum creatinine, urine albumin, urine creatinine, and leukocytes (white blood cells) in the urine."},
