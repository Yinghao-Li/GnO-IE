ANP: This stands for Atrial Natriuretic Peptide, which is a hormone that is produced and released by the heart in response to increased blood volume or pressure.\n4. AVP: This stands for Arginine Vasopressin, which is a hormone that is produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland in response to increased osmolarity or decreased blood volume.\n5. CCB: This stands for Calcium Channel Blockers, which are a class of drugs that are used to treat hypertension, angina, and certain arrhythmias by blocking the influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells.\n6.
