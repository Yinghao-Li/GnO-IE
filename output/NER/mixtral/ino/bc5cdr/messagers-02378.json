Analyze the context of each word or phrase to confirm if it is a disease entity.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n\n* hepatotoxicity\n* acute hepatitis\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the context:\n\n* Hepatotoxicity: It refers to chemical-driven liver damage or liver disease caused by drugs or other toxic substances. It is a condition, not a disease but closely related to liver diseases.\n* Acute hepatitis: Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, and acute hepatitis is a short-term condition where the liver becomes inflamed.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hepatotoxicity (related to liver diseases)\n2. Acute hepatitis"},
