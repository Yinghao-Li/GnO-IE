Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n * Renal cortex (as it is a specific part of the kidney)\n * Structural and functional renal changes (as any changes in the structure and function of the kidney can be considered a disease)\n * Additionally, gentamicin is a medication that can cause kidney damage or disease, so it can also be considered a disease entity in this context."},
