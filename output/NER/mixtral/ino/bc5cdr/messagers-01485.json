Determine if they refer to a specific disease or medical condition.\n\nIn the paragraph you provided, the potential disease-related phrase is:\n\n* \"temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the context:\n\n1. \"Local anesthesia\" is a medical procedure, and the paragraph mentions that it \"led to\" something.\n2. That \"something\" is \"temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis.\"\n3. \"Paralysis\" is a medical condition where muscle function is lost, and \"vocal cord paralysis\" specifically refers to the loss of movement in one or both vocal cords.\n4. In this case, the paralysis is \"temporary\" and \"ipsilateral,\" which means it affects the same side as the local anesthesia.\n\nBased on the analysis, \"temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis\" refers to a disease or medical condition. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis"},
