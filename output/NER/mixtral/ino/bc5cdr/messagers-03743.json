Myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, often by a blood clot. This can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.\n\nThe abbreviations \"ANT-MI\" and \"INF-MI\" are also used in the paragraph, which stand for anterior myocardial infarction and inferior myocardial infarction, respectively. These are more specific types of myocardial infarction, depending on the location of the blockage in the heart.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Myocardial infarction (MI)\n* Anterior myocardial infarction (ANT-MI)\n* Inferior myocardial infarction (INF-MI)"},
