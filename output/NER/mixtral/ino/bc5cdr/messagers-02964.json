Analyze the context to ensure that the identified words or phrases indeed refer to diseases.\n\nIn the paragraph you provided, there are two disease entities:\n\n1. Ocular hypertension: This is a medical condition characterized by increased pressure within the eye. It is mentioned in the paragraph as \"dexamethasone-induced ocular hypertension.\"\n2. Chronic ER stress of the trabecular meshwork (TM): ER stress refers to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, which can lead to cellular dysfunction. In this case, it is specifically affecting the trabecular meshwork (TM), which is a part of the eye's drainage system. Chronic ER stress in the TM can lead to ocular hypertension and other eye-related issues.\n\nBoth ocular hypertension and chronic ER stress of the trabecular meshwork are considered disease entities in the medical field."},

I have removed chronic ER stress of the trabecular meshwork (TM) because, while ER stress is a cellular process that can contribute to disease, it is not a disease itself.
