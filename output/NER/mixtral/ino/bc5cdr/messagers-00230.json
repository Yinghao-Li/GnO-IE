However, to provide a more specific identification, we would need to know the exact substances being referred to.\n\n2. These substances\n\nThe phrase \"these substances\" likely refers to specific chemicals that were mentioned previously in the text or will be mentioned later. Without additional context, it is not possible to identify these specific chemicals.\n\n3. Either drug\n\nThe term \"drug\" generally refers to a chemical or a mixture of chemicals that is used to prevent, treat or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being. In this case, the text mentions \"either drug,\" which implies that there are two drugs being compared.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Substances (general category)\n* These substances (specific chemicals, not identified in the text)\n* Either drug (two specific chemicals, not identified in the text)"},
