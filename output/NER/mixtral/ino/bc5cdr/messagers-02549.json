Subternal chest pain is the symptom for which the patient was admitted to the hospital. ST-segment elevation and positive troponin I are the results of the electrocardiogram and troponin test respectively, which indicate a possible myocardial infarction or heart attack."},

Myocardial infarction or heart attack (implied by ST-segment elevation and positive troponin I)\n\nThese are the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph that are directly relevant to the patient's condition. Mitral valve prolapse is a heart valve disorder, and myocardial infarction or heart attack is a condition in which blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, often by a blood clot, causing damage to the heart muscle. The other conditions mentioned in the paragraph, such as migraines and subternal chest pain, are symptoms or medical history, not diseases themselves."},
