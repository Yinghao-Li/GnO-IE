It is mentioned in the paragraph as the condition affecting a patient who has toxic flecainide plasma concentrations.\n\n2. Toxic flecainide plasma concentrations\n\nToxic flecainide plasma concentrations can be considered a disease state, as it is a condition that can lead to adverse health effects. Flecainide is a medication used to treat certain heart conditions, and toxic concentrations of the drug in the blood can cause symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath, and irregular heartbeat.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Delirium and Toxic flecainide plasma concentrations."},
