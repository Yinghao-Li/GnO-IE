LV end-diastolic pressure: This is a measurement of the pressure in the left ventricle (one of the heart's chambers) at the end of diastole (when the heart fills with blood). It is a physiological parameter and not a chemical entity.\n2. mmHg: This is a unit of measurement for pressure, specifically millimeters of mercury. It is a physical unit and not a chemical entity.\n3. Tau: This is a symbol used to represent the relaxation time constant of the heart. It is a physiological parameter and not a chemical entity.\n4. ms: This is a unit of measurement for time, specifically milliseconds. It is a physical unit and not a chemical entity.\n5. Fractional shortening: This is a measurement of the degree of contraction of the heart. It is a physiological parameter and not a chemical entity.\n6. LV base: This refers to the base of the left ventricle, one of the heart's chambers. It is an anatomical term and not a chemical entity.\n7. %: This is a symbol used to represent percentage.
