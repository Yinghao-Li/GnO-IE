The potential disease-related words or phrases in the paragraph are \"nephrotoxicity\" and \"metabolism.\"\n2. Checking a medical dictionary or reliable online source, we can find that:\n * Nephrotoxicity: damage or toxic effect on the kidney\n * Metabolism: the chemical changes in or by which a substance is transformed within an organism\n\nHowever, neither of these terms refers to a specific disease. Nephrotoxicity is a condition or adverse effect that can be caused by various substances, and metabolism is a natural process in living organisms.
