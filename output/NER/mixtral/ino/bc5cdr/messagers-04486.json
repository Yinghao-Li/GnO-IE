    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Calcium antagonist: This is a class of chemical compounds that inhibit the movement of calcium ions into cardiac and smooth muscle cells. In this case, the specific calcium antagonist being studied is \"CD - 832.\"\n2. Isoproterenol: This is a synthetic catecholamine used as a positive chronotrope and inotrope in the treatment of bradycardia and cardiogenic shock. It works by stimulating beta-adrenergic receptors, which increases heart rate and contractility.\n3. Myocardial ischemia: This is a condition in which blood flow to the heart muscle is reduced, leading to a lack of oxygen and nutrients. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and abnormal heart rhythms.\n4. Coronary stenosis: This is a narrowing of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. It can be caused by atherosclerosis, inflammation, or other conditions.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Calcium antagonist (CD - 832)\n* Isoproterenol\n* Myocardial ischemia\n* Coronary stenosis"},
