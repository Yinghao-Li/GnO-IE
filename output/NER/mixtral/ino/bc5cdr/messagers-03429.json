Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn this paragraph, the potential disease-related words or phrases are:\n\n* tachycardia\n\nNow, let's analyze the context of this word:\n\n* Tachycardia refers to a rapid heart rate, usually defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute in adults. It can be a normal response to physical activity, stress, or excitement, but it can also be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as heart disease, anemia, or hyperthyroidism.\n\nTherefore, in this context, tachycardia is being used to describe a symptom or condition that can be associated with various diseases. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific disease in connection with tachycardia.\n\nConclusion: The \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is tachycardia, which can be a symptom or condition associated with various diseases."},

It is not a disease.\n* Tachycardia: It is a rapid heart rate, which can be a symptom or condition associated with various diseases.\n* Normally innervated hearts: It refers to hearts with normal nerve supply. It is not a disease.\n\nConclusion: The only entity in the paragraph that clearly refers to a disease is tachycardia."},
