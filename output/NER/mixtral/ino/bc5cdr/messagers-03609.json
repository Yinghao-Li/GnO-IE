Fibrosis itself is not a disease, but it can be a symptom or a result of various diseases, especially chronic inflammation. In this context, it likely refers to liver fibrosis.\n* Hepatocellular regeneration: The process of liver cells (hepatocytes) dividing and replacing damaged or lost liver tissue.
