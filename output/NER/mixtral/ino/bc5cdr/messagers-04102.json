Here, it is used to describe the context in which the drugs are being administered. It is not a chemical entity but a description of the administration of a chemical.\n* 'Substances' generally refer to a material with a definite chemical composition. In this context, it is clear that 'substances' are chemical entities, as they are being administered for a therapeutic effect.\n\nTherefore, the identified chemical entities in the paragraph are 'substances'."},
