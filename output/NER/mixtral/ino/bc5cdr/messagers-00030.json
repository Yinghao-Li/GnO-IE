The K(+)-channels are sensitive to some of these substances.\n4. The paragraph mentions two types of activity related to morphine: hypoactivity and hyperactivity.\n5. The blockade of K(+)-channels sensitive to certain blockers is not sufficient to prevent morphine-induced hypoactivity.\n6. Morphine-induced hyperactivity seems to be connected to both quinine- and 4-aminopyridine-sensitive K(+)-channels.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Morphine-induced hypoactivity\n* Morphine-induced hyperactivity\n\nNote that these are not diseases in the traditional sense, but rather conditions or states that can be caused by the administration of morphine."},
