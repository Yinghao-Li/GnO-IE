Oxytocics are a group of drugs that stimulate uterine contractions, and are therefore used in childbirth and to control bleeding after childbirth.\n2. Blood transfusion: While not a chemical in the traditional sense, blood transfusion is a medical procedure that involves the transfer of blood or blood components from one person (the donor) to another person (the recipient). However, the blood itself contains various chemicals, such as hemoglobin, that could be considered chemical entities.\n3. 200 microg: This is a unit of measurement for a chemical substance. In this case, it refers to the dosage of oxytocics administered to the patients.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are oxytocics, blood (which contains various chemicals), and 200 microg (a unit of measurement for a chemical substance)."},
