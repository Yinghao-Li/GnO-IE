They are often used to treat or prevent blood clots in veins or arteries, which can lead to serious medical conditions such as stroke, heart attack, or pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulants work by inhibiting the coagulation cascade, which is a series of chemical reactions that lead to the formation of a blood clot. Examples of anticoagulants include heparin, warfarin, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran."},
