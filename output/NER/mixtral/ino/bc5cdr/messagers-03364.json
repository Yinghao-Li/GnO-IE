Analyze the terms to determine if they meet the criteria for a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential disease-related terms are:\n\n* azotemia\n* serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl\n* BUN greater than 50 mg/dl\n\nNow, let's analyze these terms to determine if they meet the criteria for a \"Disease\" entity:\n\n1. azotemia - This is a disease or medical condition characterized by the retention of nitrogenous waste products (urea, creatinine, etc.) in the blood due to kidney dysfunction.\n2. serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl - While creatinine itself is not a disease, elevated levels of creatinine in the blood (serum) can indicate kidney disease or dysfunction. In this context, a serum creatinine level greater than 2.5 mg/dl is indicative of significant kidney impairment and can be considered a disease state.\n3. BUN greater than 50 mg/dl - Similar to creatinine, BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) is not a disease but an indicator of kidney function. An elevated BUN level (greater than 50 mg/dl) can suggest kidney disease or dysfunction and can be considered a disease state.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* azotemia\n* serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl (indicating kidney disease or dysfunction)\n* BUN greater than 50 mg/dl (indicating kidney disease or dysfunction)"},
