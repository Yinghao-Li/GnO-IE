Although \"pro-apoptotic\" is not a chemical itself, it describes a property of certain proteins involved in chemical reactions during apoptosis.\n3. Anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2: BCL-2 is a specific protein known to inhibit apoptosis, making it an anti-apoptotic protein. In this context, BCL-2 is a chemical entity, as proteins are complex molecules consisting of amino acids and can be considered chemicals.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the specific protein BCL-2 and, more generally, the pro-apoptotic proteins (although \"pro-apoptotic\" itself is not a chemical)."},
