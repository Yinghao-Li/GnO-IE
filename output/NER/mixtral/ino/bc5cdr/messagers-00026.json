Morphine: This is a chemical compound that is a type of opiate and is derived from the opium poppy. It is a powerful painkiller and is used medically to treat severe pain.\n3. 4-Aminopyridine: This is a chemical compound that is a type of pyridine derivative. It is used in research to study the electrical properties of nerve cells and is also used as a medication to treat certain types of nerve damage.\n\nAll three of these entities are chemical compounds, so they can all be considered \"chemical\" entities."},
