It is not a chemical in the traditional sense, but rather a system involving several chemicals and enzymes.\n2. Beta - adrenoceptor (beta - AR): This is a type of receptor found on the surface of cells that is activated by catecholamines, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. It is not a chemical, but rather a type of protein.\n3. Isoproterenol (Iso): This is a synthetic non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist, a type of drug that mimics the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline by activating beta-adrenergic receptors. It is a chemical.\n\nSo, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Isoproterenol (Iso)."},
