An opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is a condition in which a patient experiences increased pain sensitivity due to opioid use.

Opioid addiction is a disease characterized by the compulsive seeking and use of opioids despite harmful consequences.\n4. Withdrawal from opioid addiction is a process where a person's body experiences various symptoms after reducing or stopping opioid use, which is also a part of the disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Opioid addiction\n* Withdrawal from opioid addiction"},

Opioid analgesics: These are a type of medication that is used to relieve pain. \"Opioid\" refers to a class of drugs that include legal painkillers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine, as well as illegal drugs like heroin. \"Analgesics\" are substances that reduce pain.\n\nTherefore, \"opioid analgesics\" refers to a category of drugs that are used to treat pain and are derived from the opium poppy or synthesized to have similar effects.\n\n2. Opioid addiction: This is a chronic and relapsing disorder characterized by the compulsive use of opioid drugs despite their harmful consequences.\n\nTherefore, \"opioid addiction\" is a condition in which a person becomes dependent on opioid drugs and experiences withdrawal symptoms when they try to stop using them.\n\n3. Withdrawal: This is a group of symptoms that occur when a person who has been using opioid drugs regularly stops taking them.\n\nTherefore, \"withdrawal\" in this context refers to the physical and psychological symptoms that can occur when a person who is addicted to opioid drugs stops using them.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"opioid analgesics\" and \"opioid addiction,\" which both refer to substances that are derived from the opium poppy or synthesized to have similar effects. \"Withdrawal\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a physiological response to the absence of opioid drugs in the body."},
