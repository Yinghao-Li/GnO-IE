    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Cholecystokinin - octapeptide (CCK-8): This is a chemical entity. It is a specific form of cholecystokinin, which is a hormone consisting of a chain of amino acids. In this case, CCK-8 is an octapeptide, meaning it is composed of eight amino acids.\n2. Central nervous system: While not a chemical itself, the central nervous system is mentioned in the context of the biological activities of CCK-8. It is made up of the brain and spinal cord and is responsible for processing sensory information, regulating vital functions, and controlling movement and behavior.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Cholecystokinin - octapeptide (CCK-8)."},
