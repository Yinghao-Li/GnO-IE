It can cause itching, swelling, and other symptoms.\n2. H1 receptors: These are a type of receptor in the body that are activated by histamine, leading to various physiological responses.\n3. Pertussis immunization: This is a vaccine that is given to protect against whooping cough, which is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. The vaccine contains chemicals that stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the bacteria.\n4. Encephalopathy: This is a general term that refers to any disease or damage to the brain. In this context, it is likely being used to describe a specific type of brain damage that can occur as a complication of pertussis immunization.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are histamine, H1 receptors, and the chemicals present in the pertussis immunization."},
