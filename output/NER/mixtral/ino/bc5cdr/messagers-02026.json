Urine is a fluid that is produced by the kidneys and excreted through the urinary tract.\n2. Volume: While not a chemical itself, urine volume refers to the amount of urine produced and is closely related to the chemical composition of the urine.\n3. Osmolality: This is a measure of the concentration of solutes (chemical particles) in a solution. In this case, urine osmolality refers to the concentration of solutes in the urine.\n4. Free water reabsorption: This refers to the process by which water is reabsorbed from the urine back into the body. While not a chemical itself, it is closely related to the chemical composition of the urine.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are urine, urine volume, urine osmolality, and free water reabsorption."},
