STZ (750 Î¼g): This is a chemical entity. STZ stands for streptozotocin, a chemical used to induce diabetes in experimental animals. The number 750 indicates the dose (750 micrograms).\n5. d 1 and d 3: These are abbreviations for days 1 and 3, not chemical entities.\n6. passive avoidance task: This is a behavioral test used in experimental psychology, not a chemical entity.\n7. 2 weeks: This is a time duration, not a chemical entity.\n8. first injection of STZ: This refers back to the chemical entity STZ mentioned earlier.\n\nSo, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is STZ (streptozotocin)."},
