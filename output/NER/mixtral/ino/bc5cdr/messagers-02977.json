Hyperalgesia is a medical condition, and \"opioid-induced\" suggests it is related to opioids, a class of chemicals. However, in this context, \"OIH\" is used as a noun referring to the condition itself, not the chemical substances causing it. Therefore, \"OIH\" is not a chemical entity in this paragraph.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are \"Rg1\" and \"Rb1\"."},
