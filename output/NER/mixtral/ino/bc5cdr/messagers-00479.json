Electrocardiogram (ECG): This is a medical test that measures the electrical activity of the heart, and while not a chemical itself, it is closely related to the field of electrochemistry.\n4. Myocardial necrosis: This is a medical condition that refers to the death of heart muscle cells, which can be caused by a variety of chemical processes, such as the deprivation of oxygen or the presence of toxins.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are cocaine, myocardial infarction (MI), and myocardial necrosis."},
