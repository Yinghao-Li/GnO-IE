MRI: While not a chemical itself, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a medical imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues within the body.\n3. Cerebral: This refers to the brain, specifically the cerebrum, which is the largest part of the brain and is responsible for higher brain functions including cognition, perception, and motor function.\n4. Deterioration: This is a process of becoming worse in condition or ceasing to function properly, it is not a chemical but it is related to the effect of chronic methamphetamine abuse on the brain.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"Methamphetamine\" and \"MRI\" (even though MRI is not a chemical, it is a technology that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of the body, and it is used in this paragraph to study the effects of methamphetamine on the brain)"},
