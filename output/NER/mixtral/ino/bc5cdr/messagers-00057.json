Determine if the words or phrases are being used to describe a disease or a condition.\n3. Analyze the context in which the words or phrases are used.\n\nIn this paragraph, the words \"necrosis\" and \"apoptosis\" are mentioned. Both of these terms refer to specific types of cell death or cellular conditions.\n\n1. Necrosis: Necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs as a result of acute cellular injury, such as infection, trauma, or toxins. It is often associated with inflammation and can lead to tissue damage.\n2. Apoptosis: Apoptosis is a programmed cell death process that occurs as part of normal development and tissue homeostasis. It is a controlled and orderly process that helps eliminate damaged or unnecessary cells without causing inflammation.\n\nIn this context, these terms are not being used to describe a disease itself, but rather the effects of certain compounds (NCQ436 and NCQ344) on cells. Therefore, \"necrosis\" and \"apoptosis\" are not considered \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},
