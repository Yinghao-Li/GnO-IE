Thromboxane: This is a chemical that is involved in the aggregation of platelets and is synthesized in the body from arachidonic acid via the action of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX).\n2. Treatments: Although not explicitly specified, it can be inferred that the treatments mentioned in the paragraph are chemical substances or medications, as they are being administered to affect the levels of thromboxane.\n3. COX-2: This is a chemical entity, specifically an enzyme, that is inhibited by the treatments. COX-2 is a form of cyclooxygenase that is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes.\n4. COX-1: This is another chemical entity, also an enzyme, that is not affected by the treatments. COX-1 is a form of cyclooxygenase that is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, but is not affected by the treatments in this study.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Thromboxane, treatments, COX-2, and COX-1."},
