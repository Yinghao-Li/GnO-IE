Analyze the context to ensure these terms are indeed referring to diseases.\n   - \"significant disease\": Although not explicitly defined, it refers to a medical condition, which can be considered a disease.\n   - \"cTnI elevations\": cTnI stands for cardiac Troponin I, a biomarker used to detect heart damage. Elevated levels indicate some form of heart disease or injury.\n   - \"MI\" (Myocardial Infarction): Also known as a heart attack, MI is a specific type of heart disease.\n4.
