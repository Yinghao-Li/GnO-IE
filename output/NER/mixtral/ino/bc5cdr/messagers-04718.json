Cocaine is a powerful stimulant drug that can have significant effects on the body, including the cardiovascular system, as described in the paragraph. However, it is not a disease entity.\n2. The paragraph describes the effects of cocaine on various cardiovascular parameters, such as heart rate, LV dP/dt, LV end-diastolic volume, systolic and mean arterial pressures, LV end-diastolic pressure, LV end-systolic volume, and LV ejection fraction. However, none of these parameters are diseases.\n3. Therefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
