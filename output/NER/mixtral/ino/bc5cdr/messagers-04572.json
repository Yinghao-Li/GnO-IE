Progestagen is a synthetic form of the natural hormone, progesterone, which is used in hormonal contraceptives. While hormonal contraceptives have been linked to an increased risk of certain diseases (e.g., blood clots, stroke), the phrase \"progestagen-only OCs\" itself does not clearly refer to a disease.\n\nTherefore, the irrelevant entities have been removed, and the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n1. VTE (Venous Thromboembolism)"},
