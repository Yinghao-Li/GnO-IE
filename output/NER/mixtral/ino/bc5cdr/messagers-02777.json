The paragraph is discussing a medical study or procedure related to chemotherapy and its impact on the heart.\n2.

The focus of the study is on \"cardiotoxicity,\" which is a condition where chemotherapy drugs negatively affect the heart.\n4. The terms \"cardiac troponin T\" and \"early detection and prediction\" suggest that the study is looking for ways to identify and predict the onset of cardiotoxicity.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* Cardiotoxicity\n\nThe main focus of the paragraph is to discuss the use of \"two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography\" and \"cardiac troponin T\" in detecting and predicting the onset of \"cardiotoxicity\" during \"epirubicin-based chemotherapy.\""},
