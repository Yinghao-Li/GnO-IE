Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two potential disease-related phrases:\n\n* Dexamethasone\n* hypertension\n\nLet's analyze the context of each phrase:\n\n* Dexamethasone: It is a medication used to treat various conditions such as inflammation, allergies, and autoimmune disorders. While it can have side effects, it is not a disease itself.\n* Hypertension: This term refers to high blood pressure, which is a medical condition and thus a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Hypertension"},

Dexamethasone is a type of corticosteroid medication, which is a synthetic version of a natural hormone produced by the adrenal gland.\n2. Hypertension: While hypertension is a condition and not a chemical, it is often associated with an imbalance of certain chemicals in the body, such as hormones or neurotransmitters.\n3. Oxidative stress: This is a chemical process that occurs in the body when there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and the body's ability to detoxify or repair the damage caused by these free radicals.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Dexamethasone and oxidative stress."},
