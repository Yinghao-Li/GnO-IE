They work by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain.\n2. Paranoia: This is a condition characterized by irrational and excessive mistrust or suspicion of others. While not a chemical itself, it can be caused by an imbalance of certain chemicals in the brain, such as serotonin or dopamine.\n3. The ventral basal ganglia: This is a region of the brain that is involved in the regulation of movement and emotion. It contains several interconnected structures, including the striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. While not a chemical, the ventral basal ganglia is made up of neurons that communicate using chemical signals called neurotransmitters.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"serotonin reuptake inhibitors\" and \"serotonin.\""},
