We need to analyze the context of the remaining phrases.\n\n1. A history of hypertension: Hypertension is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. It is a well-known disease.\n2. Higher resting systolic and diastolic BP: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure are measurements of the pressure in the arteries during and between heartbeats. Higher blood pressure could indicate various diseases, such as hypertension. However, in this context, it is not explicitly stated as a disease.\n\nTherefore, the only clear disease entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Hypertension"},
