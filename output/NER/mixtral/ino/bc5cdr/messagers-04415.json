In this paragraph, the two chemical entities are:\n   - Aldosterone\n   - L-dopa\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that helps regulate sodium and potassium balance in the body.\n* L-dopa, or levodopa, is a precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine and is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are aldosterone and L-dopa."},
