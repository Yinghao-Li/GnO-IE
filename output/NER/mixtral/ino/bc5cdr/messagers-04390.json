In this paragraph, SSRIs are mentioned as being associated with high blood levels, which may be relevant to the discussion of cognitive disorders."},

In the paragraph you provided, SSRIs are the only chemical entity mentioned. Delirium is a cognitive disorder, but it is not a chemical entity. High blood levels refer to a concentration or quantity of a substance in the blood, but in this context, it is referring to the concentration of SSRIs. Therefore, the only relevant chemical entity in the paragraph is SSRIs."},
