Analyze each one to determine if it is a chemical entity.\n\nStep 1:\n\n* SE\n* CCR2\n* imunohistochemical analyses\n\nStep 2:\n\n* SE: It is not clear from the context what \"SE\" refers to. It may or may not be a chemical entity.\n* CCR2: CCR2 is a protein that is part of the chemokine receptor family. It is not a chemical in the traditional sense, but it is a biological molecule.\n* imunohistochemical analyses: This is a laboratory technique used to detect the presence and location of specific proteins or other antigens in tissues. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only potential chemical entity in the text is \"SE\", but its meaning is unclear from the context. Therefore, I cannot definitively identify any chemical entities in the paragraph."},
