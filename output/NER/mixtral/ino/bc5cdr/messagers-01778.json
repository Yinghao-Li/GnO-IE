Primary hyperparathyroidism - This is a disease where the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone, leading to increased calcium levels in the blood.\n2. Lithium therapy - Although not a disease itself, it is a medical treatment using the drug lithium, often used to manage mood disorders such as bipolar disorder. However, long-term use of lithium can have side effects, including primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"Primary hyperparathyroidism\" and \"lithium therapy\" (indirectly, as a cause of primary hyperparathyroidism)."},
