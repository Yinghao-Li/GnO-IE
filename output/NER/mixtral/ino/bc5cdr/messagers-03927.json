    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Idiopathic orthostatic hypotension: While \"hypotension\" refers to low blood pressure, it is not a chemical entity. \"Idiopathic\" means of unknown cause, and \"orthostatic\" refers to a posture or position, so these words do not refer to chemicals either.\n2. Autonomic dysfunction: \"Autonomic\" refers to the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary actions, and \"dysfunction\" means impaired or abnormal function. These words do not refer to chemical entities.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"chemical\" entities in the given paragraph."},
