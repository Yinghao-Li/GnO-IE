Pre-existing: While not a chemical, it is important to note that this term refers to a condition that exists before a particular event (in this case, the carotid endarterectomy).\n2. Paralysis: Also not a chemical, paralysis refers to the loss of muscle function in part of the body.\n3. Frequency: This term is not a chemical either, but it is important to include as it is a key term in the paragraph.\n4. Carotid endarterectomy: This is a surgical procedure to remove plaque from the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain. The word \"carotid\" refers to the carotid artery, and \"endarterectomy\" refers to the surgical removal of the inner lining of an artery.\n5. Local anesthesia: This is a type of anesthesia that is administered to a specific part of the body to block pain in that area. The word \"anesthesia\" comes from the Greek words \"an-\" meaning without and \"aisthesis\" meaning sensation.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"carotid\" and \"anesthesia.\""},
