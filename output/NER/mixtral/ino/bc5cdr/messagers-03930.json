Propranolol: This is a chemical entity, specifically it is a medication used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and certain types of tremors.\n2. mg: This stands for milligram, which is a unit of weight used in the metric system. It is used here to describe the dosage of propranolol.\n3. Blood pressures: While not a chemical itself, blood pressure is a measure of the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of the blood vessels, which can be affected by various chemicals.\n4. mmHg: This stands for millimeters of mercury, which is the unit of measurement used for blood pressure.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are propranolol, mg, and mmHg."},
