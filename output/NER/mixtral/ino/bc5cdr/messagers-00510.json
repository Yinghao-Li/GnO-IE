Seizure: While \"seizure\" is often considered a medical condition rather than a chemical, it is important to note that it can be caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. Therefore, it can be considered a chemical entity in a broader sense.\n2. Breakdown: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a process or event.\n3. BBB: BBB stands for Blood-Brain Barrier, which is a specialized barrier that separates the brain from the bloodstream. It is made up of tightly packed cells that regulate the passage of substances from the blood into the brain. Therefore, BBB can be considered a chemical entity as it is made up of cells and regulates the movement of chemicals.\n\nOverall, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"seizure\" and \"BBB\"."},
