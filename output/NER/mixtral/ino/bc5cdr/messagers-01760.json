The term \"arrhythmias\" is a disease entity, as it refers to an abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"cardiac arrhythmias.\""},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Propranolol: This is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called beta blockers. It is used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, angina (chest pain), and other heart conditions.\n2. Isomers of propranolol: Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural formulas. In this case, the isomers of propranolol refer to the different forms of the propranolol molecule.\n3. Adrenaline: Also known as epinephrine, adrenaline is a hormone and neurotransmitter that is released in response to stress. It plays a key role in the \"fight or flight\" response and is used medically to treat allergic reactions, cardiac arrest, and other conditions.\n4. Halothane: This is a general anesthetic that is used to sedate patients during surgery. It works by depressing the central nervous system and causing a loss of consciousness.\n5. mg/kg: This is a unit of measurement that stands for milligrams per kilogram. It is used to express the dose of a medication in terms of the amount given per unit of body weight.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are propranolol, its isomers, adrenaline, and halothane."},
