Hyperosmolar therapy is a medical treatment that involves the use of substances to increase the osmolarity (concentration of solute) of body fluids.\n2. Hyperventilation: This is not a chemical entity. Hyperventilation is a medical condition where a person breathes faster and deeper than normal, causing an excess intake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide from the blood.\n3. Sedation: This is not a chemical entity. Sedation is a state of calmness or sleepiness induced by certain drugs or medications.\n4. Chemical paralysis: This term refers to the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (chemical entities) to cause temporary paralysis of the skeletal muscles during medical procedures.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"neuromuscular blocking agents\" or \"chemical paralysis\" as a whole."},
