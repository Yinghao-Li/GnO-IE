Renal failure refers to the inability of the kidneys to properly filter waste products from the blood. In this case, the adjective \"acute\" is used to describe the sudden onset of the condition.\n2. Intravenous desferrioxamine therapy: While not a disease itself, intravenous desferrioxamine therapy can sometimes lead to acute renal failure as a side effect. Desferrioxamine is a medication used to remove excess iron from the body, and it is given intravenously in some cases.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"Acute renal failure\" and \"intravenous desferrioxamine therapy\" (as a potential cause of renal failure)."},
