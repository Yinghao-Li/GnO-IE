Thromboembolism: This is not a chemical entity. Thromboembolism is a medical condition that occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein or artery and then breaks off and travels through the bloodstream, potentially causing a blockage in another part of the body.\n4.

Side effects refer to any undesirable symptoms or medical conditions that occur in addition to the intended effects of a medication.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is heparin."},
