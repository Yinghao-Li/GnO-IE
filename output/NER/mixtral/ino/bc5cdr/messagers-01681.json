Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE): While this is a medical condition, it is often associated with certain chemical imbalances or responses in the body, so it can be considered a chemical entity in a broad sense.\n3. Sural nerve sensory action potential (SAP): This is a chemical entity in the sense that it is a specific type of potential or electrical signal generated by nerve cells, which is a chemical process.\n4. Refractory: While this is not a chemical entity itself, it is a term used in chemistry and medicine to describe a material or condition that is resistant to change or treatment, so it is related to the chemical nature of the substances and processes involved.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are thalidomide, cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), sural nerve sensory action potential (SAP), and the concept of refractory as it relates to chemical processes."},
