Analyzing the context:\n * \"Hepatitis B\" is a well-known disease that affects the liver, and \"e antigen\" is a component of the hepatitis B virus.\n * \"Aminotransferase\" is an enzyme found in the liver and other organs, and elevated levels of these enzymes in the blood can indicate liver damage or disease. However, in this context, \"aminotransferase levels\" alone do not necessarily indicate a specific disease.\n3. Removing irrelevant entities:\n * \"Aminotransferase levels\" are not a disease themselves, but can indicate liver disease. Since the context does not specify a particular liver disease, we cannot definitively say that \"aminotransferase levels\" refer to a disease.\n\nTherefore, the entity that clearly refers to a disease in the paragraph is:\n- Hepatitis B"},

It is considered a chemical entity, as it is a biomolecule.\n* aminotransferase: These are enzymes that transfer amino groups between molecules. They are classified as chemicals, specifically as proteins or enzymes.\n* levels: This term refers to the amount or concentration of a substance, in this case, aminotransferase. It is an abstract concept and not a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"hepatitis B e antigen\" and \"aminotransferase.\""},
