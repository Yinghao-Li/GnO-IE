Anthracyclins are a class of drugs that are derived from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius. They work by intercalating DNA and inhibiting the function of the enzyme topoisomerase II, which is necessary for DNA replication and transcription.\n\n2. Doxorubicin (DOX): This is a specific anthracyclin drug that is commonly used in chemotherapy. It is also known by the brand name Adriamycin. Doxorubicin works by interfering with the DNA in cancer cells, which prevents the cells from dividing and growing.\n\nBoth anthracyclin and doxorubicin are chemical entities, as they are both chemical compounds that have been synthesized or isolated for use in medical treatments."},
