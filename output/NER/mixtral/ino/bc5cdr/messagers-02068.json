Neuroplasticity: While neuroplasticity is a process and not a chemical, it is often associated with changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters and other chemical messengers in the brain.\n2. Neuroinflammatory: This term refers to the inflammation that occurs in the nervous tissue, which can be caused by various chemical mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins.\n3. Seizures: Seizures can be caused by an imbalance of various chemicals in the brain, including neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are neurotransmitters (such as those involved in neuroplasticity), chemical mediators of neuroinflammation (such as cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins), and the chemicals involved in causing seizures (such as glutamate and GABA)."},
