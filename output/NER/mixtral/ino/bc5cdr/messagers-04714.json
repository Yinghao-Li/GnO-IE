Analyze the context to ensure that the identified words or phrases are indeed being used to refer to a disease.\n\nIn this paragraph, the potential medical conditions or diseases are:\n\n* \"a high intracoronary cocaine concentration\"\n* \"LV systolic and diastolic function\"\n\nHowever, upon analyzing the context, we can see that \"a high intracoronary cocaine concentration\" is not a disease itself, but rather a factor that can influence the function of the heart. Therefore, the disease entity in this paragraph is:\n\n* \"LV systolic and diastolic function\"\n\nLV (Left Ventricular) systolic and diastolic function refer to the ability of the left ventricle of the heart to contract and relax, respectively, which are crucial for proper blood circulation. Any impairment in LV systolic or diastolic function can indicate heart disease or dysfunction."},
