The paragraph also mentions the effect of morphine on spine density decreases in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Amnesia\n* The decreased spine density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (this is not a disease but a condition caused by morphine treatment)\n\nNote: Morphine is not a disease, it is a drug."},

The \"8\" likely refers to the number of amino acids in the specific form of CCK being discussed.\n2. Morphine: This is another chemical entity. It is a powerful opiate pain medication.\n3. Amnesia: While not a chemical, amnesia is a condition that can be caused by chemical interactions in the brain, so it's worth noting in this context.\n4. Spine density: This is a biological term referring to the number of dendritic spines per unit length of dendrite, but it's not a chemical entity.\n5. The CA1 region of the hippocampus: This is a specific region of the brain, not a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are CCK - 8 and morphine."},
