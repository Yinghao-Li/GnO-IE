Analyze each entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: The potential chemical entities in the text are \"H1\" and \"H2 antagonists\".\n\nStep 2: To confirm if they are chemicals, let's look up the terms:\n\n* H1: Historically, H1 referred to a type of histamine receptor. However, it is not a chemical itself. An antagonist for H1 receptors is a chemical, often an antihistamine drug.\n* H2: Similar to H1, H2 originally referred to a type of histamine receptor. Again, it is not a chemical itself, but an antagonist for H2 receptors is a chemical, often used to treat gastric acid-related conditions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are \"H1 antagonists\" and \"H2 antagonists\"."},
