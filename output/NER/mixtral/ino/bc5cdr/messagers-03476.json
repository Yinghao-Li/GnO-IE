It is a type of drug called a beta-2 agonist, which works by relaxing the muscles in the airways and increasing the amount of air that can flow through them.\n\n2. Beta-adrenoceptor: This is a type of receptor found in the body that is activated by certain hormones and neurotransmitters, including adrenaline. When beta-adrenoceptors are activated, they trigger a range of responses in the body, including the relaxation of smooth muscle in the airways.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are salbutamol and beta-adrenoceptor."},
