Therefore, \"optic neuropathy\" is the identified disease entity in this paragraph.\n* Ethambutol is an antibiotic medication used to treat tuberculosis, and one of its side effects is optic neuropathy, which is damage to the optic nerve. This is why it is essential to monitor patients' vision while on ethambutol therapy."},
