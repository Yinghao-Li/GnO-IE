It is also a potassium channel opener and is used to treat hypertension.\n3. Vasodilation: While not a chemical itself, vasodilation is a physiological process that is often induced by chemicals, such as cromakalim and pinacidil.\n4. Hypotension: This is a condition characterized by low blood pressure, which can be caused by various chemicals, including cromakalim and pinacidil.\n5. Beta adrenergic receptors blockade: This is a medical procedure that involves blocking the action of beta adrenergic receptors, which can be affected by certain chemicals.\n6. Muscarinic receptors blockade: Similar to beta adrenergic receptors blockade, this is a medical procedure that involves blocking the action of muscarinic receptors, which can also be affected by certain chemicals.\n7. Tachycardia: This is a medical condition characterized by a rapid heart rate, which can be induced by certain chemicals, such as cromakalim and pinacidil.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are cromakalim, pinacidil, and tachycardia (indirectly, as it is a condition induced by chemicals)."},
