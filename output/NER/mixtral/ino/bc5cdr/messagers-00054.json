Fluorescence microscopy: This is a technique used to visualize and analyze the fluorescence of samples and not a chemical entity.\n3. Hoechst 33342: This is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C16H18Cl2N3O5. It is a fluorescent dye used to stain DNA, particularly in cells undergoing apoptosis.\n4. Propidium iodide: This is another chemical compound with the molecular formula C21H20ClN3O5. It is a fluorescent dye used to stain the DNA of cells, often in conjunction with Hoechst 33342, to differentiate between live and dead cells.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide."},
