In this paragraph, the two chemical entities are:\n   - \"ouabain\"\n   - \"oxidative stress\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Ouabain\" is a specific type of chemical, a cardiac glycoside, that can be used to induce mania-like behavior in animals.\n* \"Oxidative stress\" is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and the body's ability to detoxify these reactive products. It is a chemical process that can contribute to various diseases, including bipolar disorder."},
