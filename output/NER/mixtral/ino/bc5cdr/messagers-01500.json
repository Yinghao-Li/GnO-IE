Status epilepticus: While not a chemical, it is important to note that this is a medical condition characterized by a prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness between seizures.\n3. Neurons: These are not chemical entities, but they are biological cells that are important to mention in this context because the study is investigating their damage.\n4. Astrocytes: These are also not chemical entities, but they are a type of non-neuronal cell in the brain that are important to mention in this context because the study is investigating their involvement in the damage to the substantia nigra pars reticulata.\n5. Serum: This is a chemical entity. It is the clear yellow fluid that separates from blood when it clots.\n6. Protein extravasation: This is a chemical process in which proteins leak out of blood vessels and enter the surrounding tissue. It is an important aspect of the study because it can indicate damage to the blood-brain barrier.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are pilocarpine, serum, and protein extravasation."},
