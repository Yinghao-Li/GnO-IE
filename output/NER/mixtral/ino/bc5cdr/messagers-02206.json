Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders. In this case, it is being administered in a dose of 80 mg.\n2. p. o.: This is an abbreviation for \"per os,\" a Latin phrase that means \"by mouth.\" It is a route of administration for medications, but it is not a chemical entity.\n3. PRL: This stands for prolactin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. It is not a chemical entity in and of itself, but it is a biological molecule that can be measured using chemical methods.\n4. immunometric chemiluminescence: This is a chemical technique used to measure the amount of a specific substance, such as PRL, in a sample. It involves the use of antibodies that bind to the substance of interest and generate a light signal that can be detected and quantified. Therefore, while not a chemical entity itself, this technique is a chemical method.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Verapamil 80 mg and the immunometric chemiluminescence technique used to measure PRL levels."},
