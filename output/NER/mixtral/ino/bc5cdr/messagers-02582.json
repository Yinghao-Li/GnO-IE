Cholesterol: While high cholesterol is a risk factor for certain diseases such as heart disease, cholesterol itself is not a disease.\n2. Triglyceride: High levels of triglycerides in the blood can be a sign of various medical conditions, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or hypothyroidism, but it is not a disease on its own.\n3. LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein): Often referred to as \"bad cholesterol,\" LDL plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, which can lead to various cardiovascular diseases. However, LDL itself is not a disease.\n\nTherefore, no clear \"Disease\" entities can be identified in the provided paragraph."},
