In the given paragraph, the term \"Milk-alkali syndrome\" can be identified as the \"Disease\" entity.\n\nMilk-alkali syndrome is a condition that can occur from taking in too much calcium, often in the form of antacids used to treat stomach acid conditions. When too much calcium builds up in the body, it can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, and in severe cases, kidney failure. It is important to diagnose and treat milk-alkali syndrome promptly to avoid serious complications."},

Alkali refers to a basic substance or compound with pH greater than 7. Alkalis can react with acids to form salts and water, a process known as neutralization.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are milk (a biological macromolecule) and alkali (a basic substance or compound)."},
