The text discusses the use of hiPS-CMs (human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes) with MEA system (multi-electrode array system) and FPDc (field potential duration correction) to predict the effects of drug candidates on QT interval. QT interval is a measurement of the electrical activity of the heart, and prolongation of the QT interval can be a side effect of certain drugs, which may lead to serious heart rhythm problems. However, QT interval prolongation itself is not a disease but a potential adverse effect of some medications."},
