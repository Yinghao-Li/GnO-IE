Renal (kidney) disease or dysfunction\n2. Kidney disease (implied by renal hemodynamics and sodium retention)"},

It is mentioned in the context of its effect on renal function, so it is likely a drug or other chemical compound.\n4. Sodium retention: While not a chemical entity itself, sodium retention is a physiological response to certain chemical compounds, such as drugs or hormones. In this case, it is mentioned as a side effect of the 800-micrograms dose, so it is relevant to the discussion of chemical entities in the paragraph."},
