Vigabatrin is a medication used to treat epilepsy.\n2. The paragraph mentions that binasal visual field defects are not specific to vigabatrin.\n\nBased on the context, we can infer that:\n\n- Vigabatrin is not a disease itself but a medication used to treat a disease (epilepsy).\n- Binasal visual field defects are a possible side effect of vigabatrin, but they are not a disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities in the provided paragraph."},
