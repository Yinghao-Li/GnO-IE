Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph \"At admission simvastatin and all antiviral drugs were discontinued because toxicity due to a drug - drug interaction was suspected\", the potential disease-related phrases are:\n\n* toxicity\n* drug - drug interaction\n\nLet's analyze the context of each phrase:\n\n1. Toxicity: This term generally refers to the degree to which a substance (in this case, a drug) can damage an organism. Toxicity is a symptom or adverse effect, not a disease itself.\n2. Drug - drug interaction: This phrase refers to the way in which two or more drugs can react together, potentially leading to increased or decreased effects, or even toxicity. It is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},
