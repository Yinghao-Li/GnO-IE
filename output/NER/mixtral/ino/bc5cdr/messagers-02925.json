It is a severe infection of the fascia, the tissue beneath the skin that surrounds muscles, nerves, and blood vessels.\n2. Bortezomib: This is a chemical entity. It is a medication used to treat certain types of cancer, including multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. It is a type of drug called a proteasome inhibitor.\n3. Dexamethasone: This is also a chemical entity. It is a medication used to treat a variety of conditions, including allergic reactions, inflammation, and certain types of cancer. It is a type of drug called a corticosteroid.\n4. Regimen: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to a planned sequence of one or more medical treatments.\n5. Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia: This is not a chemical entity. It is a type of cancer in which the body produces too much of a protein called macroglobulin. It is a type of lymphoma, which is a cancer that affects the lymphatic system.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are bortezomib and dexamethasone."},
