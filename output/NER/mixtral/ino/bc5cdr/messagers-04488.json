It is a medical condition and not a chemical, but I am including it as it is relevant to the context.\n2. ISO: This is most likely a reference to the chemical compound isoproterenol, which is a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor agonist used in medical treatments.\n3. ng: This stands for nanogram, a unit of measurement for mass, specifically for extremely small masses. It is not a chemical itself but is relevant in the context of the concentration of isoproterenol (ISO) infusion.\n4. kg: This stands for kilogram, a unit of measurement for mass. It is not a chemical itself but is relevant in the context of the concentration of isoproterenol (ISO) infusion.\n5. min: This stands for minute, a unit of time.
