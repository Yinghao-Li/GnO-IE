The text mentions two possible medical conditions:\n   - \"central excitation\" could be a symptom of a disease, but it's not a specific disease itself.\n   - \"clonic convulsions\" and \"general depression\" are more likely to be the entities we're looking for.\n4. \"Clonic convulsions\" refer to a type of seizure where a person's muscles alternately contract and relax rapidly, resulting in shaking or jerking movements. It can be a symptom of various neurological disorders, such as epilepsy.\n5. \"General depression\" is a state of low mood and aversion to activity, which can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, feelings, and sense of well-being. It is a common symptom of various mental health disorders, such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder.\n\nThe \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Clonic convulsions (a symptom that can be associated with various neurological disorders)\n2. General depression (a symptom that can be associated with various mental health disorders)"},
