Urea: This is a chemical compound with the formula CO(NH2)2. It is a colorless, odorless solid, highly soluble in water, and practically non-toxic. Urea is the major organic component of human urine, and it is used as a fertilizer in agriculture.\n4. Creatinine: This is a chemical compound with the formula (NH2)3C(=NO)NH3. It is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle, and it is excreted by the kidneys.\n5. D - AmB: This is an abbreviation for Amphotericin B, which is a medication used to treat serious fungal infections. It is an antifungal antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces nodosus and is administered intravenously.\n6. NS - 718: This is a brand name for a medication, but it is not a chemical entity. It is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, isotonic solution of sodium chloride (0.9%) in water for injection. It is used as a fluid and electrolyte replenisher and to maintain water and electrolyte balance.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are urea, creatinine, and Amphotericin B (D - AmB)."},
