Aminonucleoside nephrosis is a medical condition that falls under the category of nephrotic syndromes, which is characterized by the damage to the kidneys' filtering units leading to the leakage of large amounts of protein in the urine.\n5. Protamine, on the other hand, is a medication used for the treatment of bleeding due to heparin overdose. It is not a disease.\n6. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\na.
