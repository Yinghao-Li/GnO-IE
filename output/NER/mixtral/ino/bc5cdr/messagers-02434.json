Mesna: This is an abbreviation for the chemical compound Mesna, which stands for 2-Mercaptoethanesulfonic acid sodium salt. It is used as a medication to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis, a side effect of ifosfamide and other chemotherapy drugs.\n3. Rabbit ' s lymphocytes: While not a chemical entity, it is important to note that lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune system.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Ifosfamide (IFO) and Mesna."},
