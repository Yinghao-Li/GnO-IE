Myocardial infarction\n\nThe paragraph discusses the effects of certain medications (dronedarone and amiodarone) in animals that have experienced a myocardial infarction, which is also commonly referred to as a heart attack. A myocardial infarction occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, often by a blood clot, leading to damage or death of the heart muscle. Therefore, myocardial infarction is a disease entity in this paragraph."},

Hemodynamic: While this term describes a physiological process (relating to blood flow), it is often considered a chemical or biochemical entity in the context of pharmacology and medicine.\n2.
