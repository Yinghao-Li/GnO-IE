It is a chemical entity, specifically a sodium channel blocker used as an antiarrhythmic drug.\n3. plasma concentrations: This refers to the amount of a substance (in this case, flecainide) present in the blood plasma. It is not a chemical entity itself, but a measurement of a chemical's presence.\n4. delirium: It is a serious disturbance in mental abilities that results in confused thinking and reduced awareness of the environment. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"flecainide.\""},
