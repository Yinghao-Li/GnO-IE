It is a neuropeptide that has been shown to have various effects on the nervous system.\n2. Scopolamine: This is another chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is a drug that is often used to induce memory impairment in animal models.\n3. There are also several other chemical terms used in the paragraph, but they are not the main focus of the study and are not being investigated as chemical entities. These terms include:\n* nmol (nanomoles): This is a unit of measurement for the amount of a substance.\n* mouse: This is a type of animal that was used in the study.\n* i.c.v.: This stands for \"intra-cerebroventricular,\" which refers to the method of administration used in the study (injecting the substance into a specific area of the brain).\n* Spontaneous alternation performance and passive avoidance tasks: These are behavioral tests that were used to assess the memory and learning abilities of the mice. They are not chemical entities, but rather procedures used to study the effects of the chemicals being investigated."},
