    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Vasoactive properties of tacrolimus: Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive drug, and its vasoactive properties might be related to certain adverse effects or conditions. However, it is not a disease itself.\n2. Proliferation of Demodex: Demodex is a type of mite that can inhabit human hair follicles and sebaceous glands. An overgrowth or proliferation of these mites can sometimes lead to a condition called demodicosis, which can cause skin issues. Therefore, \"proliferation of Demodex\" can be considered a disease entity.\n3. Local immunosuppression: Local immunosuppression is a state where the immune system's function is suppressed in a specific area of the body. This condition can be caused by various factors, such as medications (like tacrolimus) or diseases. Local immunosuppression itself is not a disease, but it can contribute to the development of various conditions or exacerbate existing ones.\n4. The occlusive properties of the ointment: The occlusive properties of an ointment refer to its ability to create a barrier on the skin, preventing moisture from escaping. This property can be beneficial in certain situations, such as protecting dry or irritated skin. However, it can also lead to adverse effects, such as skin irritation or infection, in some cases. The occlusive properties of an ointment are not a disease but can contribute to various skin conditions.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Demodicosis (resulting from the proliferation of Demodex)\n2. Skin conditions or adverse effects associated with the occlusive properties of the ointment"},
