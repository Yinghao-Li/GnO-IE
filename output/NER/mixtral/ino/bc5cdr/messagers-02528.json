Cardiopulmonary resuscitation: While not a chemical, it is a medical procedure that involves the circulation of oxygenated blood to the body when the heart has stopped beating.\n2. Electrocardiogram (ECG): Also not a chemical, it is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart.\n3. Ventricular tachycardia: This is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that originates in the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart).\n4. Fibrillation: This is a rapid, irregular contraction of muscle fibers, which can occur in the heart and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.\n5. QRS prolongation: This is a condition in which the QRS complex (a part of the ECG waveform that reflects the electrical activity of the ventricles) is prolonged, which can indicate a delay in the conduction of electrical impulses through the ventricles.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, and QRS prolongation. These are medical conditions related to the electrical activity of the heart, which can be influenced by various chemical factors, such as electrolyte imbalances or the use of certain medications."},
