Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn this paragraph, there are no specific diseases mentioned. Instead, it discusses \"cyclophosphamide-induced lesions\" of the urinary bladder in rats. Lesions are abnormalities or damages in body tissues, not diseases themselves. However, they can be a result of a disease or an adverse effect of a medical treatment.\n\nIn this context, \"cyclophosphamide-induced lesions\" can be considered as a disease entity since it refers to damage or abnormality in the urinary bladder caused by the administration of the drug cyclophosphamide.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cyclophosphamide-induced lesions of the urinary bladder."},
