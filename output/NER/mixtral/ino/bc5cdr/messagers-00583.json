Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n\n* central nervous system toxicity\n* cardiac toxicity\n\nStep 2: Analyzing context:\n\n* Central nervous system toxicity: This refers to harmful effects on the brain and nervous system due to the disruption of its normal functioning. It is often associated with exposure to certain chemicals, drugs, or other toxic substances.\n\n* Cardiac toxicity: This refers to harmful effects on the heart due to the disruption of its normal functioning. It is often associated with exposure to certain chemicals, drugs, or other toxic substances.\n\nBoth central nervous system toxicity and cardiac toxicity are adverse effects or conditions that can be caused by various diseases, toxins, or medications. However, in this paragraph, they are not explicitly mentioned as diseases but rather as potential side effects or symptoms. Nonetheless, for the purpose of this exercise, we can consider \"central nervous system toxicity\" and \"cardiac toxicity\" as disease entities.\n\nDisease entities:\n\n1.
