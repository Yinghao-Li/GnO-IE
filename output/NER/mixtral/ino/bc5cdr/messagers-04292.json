Analyze each term to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph, there are two potential medical conditions or diseases:\n\n1. \"complete AV block\"\n\nTo determine if these terms refer to a disease, we can use the following criteria:\n- Is it a disorder or abnormal condition affecting an organism?\n- Does it require medical treatment?\n\nComplete AV block (Atrioventricular block) is a disorder of the heart's electrical conduction system, which can lead to abnormal heart rhythms. It is a serious condition that may require medical intervention, such as the use of a pacemaker. Therefore, \"complete AV block\" is a disease entity in the paragraph.\n\nThe other term, \"clonidine 0 . 15 mg bid,\" refers to a medication and its dosage, not a disease. Therefore, there is only one disease entity in the paragraph: complete AV block."},
