C-4: While not a chemical itself, this term refers to the fourth carbon atom in a molecule. In this case, it is referring to the fourth carbon atom in the d-galactose molecule.\n3. d-glucose: This is a chemical entity. It is a monosaccharide, or simple sugar, that is an epimer of d-galactose.\n4. insulin: This is a hormone, not a chemical, but it is being mentioned in the context of its role in the transport of d-galactose into the brain.\n5. GLUT3 transporter: This is a chemical entity. It is a type of glucose transporter that is insulin-independent and is responsible for transporting d-galactose into the brain.\n6. Leloir pathway: This is a chemical pathway. It is a metabolic pathway that is used to convert d-galactose to glucose-1-phosphate, which can then be further metabolized to glucose.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are d-galactose, C-4 (in the context of d-galactose), d-glucose, GLUT3 transporter, and Leloir pathway."},
