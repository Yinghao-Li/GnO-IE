It is not a chemical entity in the strict sense, but it is related to chemistry.\n* \"development\" (not a chemical)\n* \"suppress\" (not a chemical)\n* \"heart hypertrophy\" - Heart hypertrophy is a medical condition related to the enlargement of the heart muscle, which can be influenced by various chemical factors and substances. It is not a chemical entity.\n* \"two beta - receptor blockers\" - Beta-receptor blockers are a class of pharmaceutical drugs that block beta-adrenergic receptors, which are proteins in the cell membrane that are activated by catecholamines like adrenaline and noradrenaline. These drugs are indeed chemical entities.\n\nIn summary, the only clear chemical entities in the paragraph are \"beta-receptor blockers.\""},
