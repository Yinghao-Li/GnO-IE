Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph \"The impairment of the renal function in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis\", the potential disease-related words or phrases are \"renal function impairment\" and \"clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis\".\n\nNow let's analyze the context of each word or phrase:\n\n1. Renal function impairment: This refers to a reduction in the ability of the kidneys to perform their functions, such as filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood. It is a disease condition.\n2. Clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis: Nephrolithiasis is a medical term for kidney stones. Clinical symptoms refer to the signs and observations that indicate the presence of a disease. In this case, the absence of clinical symptoms means that the children did not show any signs or observations typically associated with kidney stones.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Renal function impairment\n* Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) - although it is not explicitly stated that the children had kidney stones, the mention of its clinical symptoms implies its presence as a disease."},
