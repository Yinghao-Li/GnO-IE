Cluster analysis: It is a statistical method, not a disease.\n2. Lesions: Lesions are not necessarily diseases; they can be a symptom or result of a disease. In this context, it is not explicitly stated which disease is causing the lesions.\n3. PAN (Polyarteritis Nodosa) glomeruli: Polyarteritis Nodosa is a disease that affects the small and medium-sized arteries. Glomeruli are a part of the kidney. So, PAN glomeruli refer to the kidney being affected by Polyarteritis Nodosa.\n4. Dysfunction: Dysfunction is not a disease itself but a condition where a part of the body is not functioning properly. In this context, it refers to the dysfunction of mesangial areas in the PAN glomeruli.\n\nBased on the research, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"Polyarteritis Nodosa.\""},
