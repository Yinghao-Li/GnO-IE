However, in research and medical contexts, \"anxiety-like behavior\" is often used to describe a symptom or outcome of certain experimental conditions or treatments, such as exposure to Bisphenol A in this case.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Not explicitly mentioned, but the \"anxiety-like behavior\" could be considered a symptom or outcome of interest in this study."},
