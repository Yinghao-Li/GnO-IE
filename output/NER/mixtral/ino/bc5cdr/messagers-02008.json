Extracellular Matrix (ECM) - While ECM is a biological structure, it is also often considered a \"chemical\" entity in the context of biochemistry and molecular biology.\n2.

Kinase - Kinase is a type of enzyme that adds a phosphate group to another molecule, often a protein. It is a chemical entity.\n4. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) - This is a specific type of kinase associated with integrins, so it is also a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are: extracellular matrix (ECM), integrin, kinase, and integrin-linked kinase (ILK)."},
