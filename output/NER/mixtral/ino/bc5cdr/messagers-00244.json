Anti-dopaminergic: This is a term that refers to the ability of a substance to block or reduce the activity of dopamine, a type of neurotransmitter in the brain. Therefore, \"anti-dopaminergic\" can be considered a chemical entity.\n2. Veralipride: This is a specific chemical compound that is used as a medication. It is an anti-dopaminergic drug, which means it works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Therefore, \"veralipride\" can also be considered a chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, the two chemical entities in the paragraph are \"anti-dopaminergic\" and \"veralipride.\""},
