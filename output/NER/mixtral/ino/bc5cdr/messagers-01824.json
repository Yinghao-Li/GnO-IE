Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): This is the primary disease entity in the paragraph. HIT is a condition in which patients develop a decreased platelet count after being administered heparin, a common anticoagulant.\n3. Thrombocytopenia: This is another disease term mentioned in the paragraph. Thrombocytopenia refers to a condition characterized by a lower than normal number of platelets (thrombocytes) in the blood. In this context, it is a complication of HIT.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Thrombocytopenia."},

Argatroban: This is a medication that is used as an anticoagulant. It is a chemical entity, specifically a small molecule inhibitor of thrombin.\n3. Heparin: This is a medication that is used as an anticoagulant. It is a chemical entity, specifically a glycosaminoglycan that is derived from animal tissues.\n4. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): This is a condition that can occur in some patients who are treated with heparin. It is caused by an immune response to the heparin, which results in a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood. HIT is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are argatroban and heparin."},
