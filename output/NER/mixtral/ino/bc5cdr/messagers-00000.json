It is a specific form of ventricular tachycardia, which is a rapid heartbeat that originates in the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart).\n2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: This is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weakened, stretched, and thin, leading to a decrease in the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.\n3. Congestive heart failure: This is a chronic condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to a backup of fluid in the lungs and other parts of the body.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia\n* Dilated cardiomyopathy\n* Congestive heart failure"},
