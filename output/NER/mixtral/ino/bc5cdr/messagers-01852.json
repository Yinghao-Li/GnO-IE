Research and analyze each term to determine if it is a disease entity.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are several potential medical terms:\n\n* Lesion\n* Motor deterioration\n* Loss of DA neurons\n* Increased PENK gene expression\n\nLet's analyze each term:\n\n* Lesion: A lesion is not a disease itself, but rather a damage or injury to body tissue.\n* Motor deterioration: This term refers to a decline in motor function or movement ability, which can be a symptom of various neurological diseases.\n* Loss of DA neurons: DA neurons refer to dopamine-producing neurons. The loss of these neurons is associated with several neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.\n* Increased PENK gene expression: PENK (proenkephalin) is a gene that encodes for enkephalins, which are endogenous opioid peptides involved in pain regulation and other physiological processes. Increased PENK gene expression has been linked to certain neurological conditions, such as drug addiction and chronic pain.\n\nBased on the analysis, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Neurological diseases (that can cause motor deterioration)\n2. Parkinson's disease (associated with the loss of DA neurons)\n\nThe exact diseases are not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but the context suggests that the text discusses neurological conditions and Parkinson's disease-related symptoms."},

DA: This is also a chemical entity. DA is an abbreviation for dopamine, a type of neurotransmitter found in the brain.\n3. PENK: This is a chemical entity. PENK is an abbreviation for proenkephalin, a precursor protein that is broken down to produce enkephalins, which are endogenous opioid peptides that act as neurotransmitters.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are 6 - OHDA, DA, and PENK."},
