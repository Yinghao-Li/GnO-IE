It is an alkylating agent, which means it works by methylating or ethylating DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription.\n2. Mesna: This is a medication used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis, a side effect of ifosfamide and other chemotherapy drugs. Mesna works by neutralizing the urotoxic metabolites of ifosfamide in the urinary tract.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are ifosfamide and mesna."},
