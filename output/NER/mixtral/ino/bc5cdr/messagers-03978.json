Analyze each potential chemical entity.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text are:\n\n* cyclosporine\n* CMV (Cytomegalovirus) infection\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each potential chemical entity:\n\n* cyclosporine: It is a medication used to prevent the body from rejecting a transplanted organ. Cyclosporine is classified as an immunosuppressant. It works by decreasing your body's immune system's response, which helps to lower the chance of organ rejection.\n* CMV (Cytomegalovirus) infection: CMV is a common virus that can infect people of all ages. Once infected, the virus remains in the body for life. In healthy people, the virus usually does not cause symptoms. However, in people with weakened immune systems, such as transplant recipients, people with HIV/AIDS, or those on chemotherapy, CMV can cause severe symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. cyclosporine: an immunosuppressant medication\n2. CMV (Cytomegalovirus) infection: a viral infection that can cause severe symptoms in people with weakened immune systems."},
