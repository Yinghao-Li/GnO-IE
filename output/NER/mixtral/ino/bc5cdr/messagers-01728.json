In the given paragraph, the terms \"tubular atrophy,\" \"interstitial infiltration,\" and \"fibrosis\" are potential disease entities.\n4. Break down each term:\n * Tubular atrophy: Atrophy refers to the wasting or decrease in size of a cell, tissue, or organ. In the context of the kidney, tubular atrophy specifically refers to the shrinkage of the renal tubules. This is a pathological condition and can be considered a disease entity.\n * Interstitial infiltration: Infiltration in a medical context usually refers to the abnormal presence of cells or substances in a tissue or organ. Interstitial infiltration implies the presence of inflammatory cells in the interstitium (the space between the renal tubules). This is also a pathological condition and can be considered a disease entity.\n * Fibrosis: Fibrosis is the formation of excess fibrous tissue in an organ or tissue, replacing normal tissue and impairing function. In the context of the kidney, fibrosis implies the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, which can lead to loss of kidney function. Fibrosis is a pathological condition and can be considered a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Tubular atrophy\n2. Interstitial infiltration\n3. Fibrosis\n\nThese entities are related to a kidney condition, specifically ADR nephropathy, which is mentioned in the paragraph."},
