It is not a disease.\n* Modified barium swallow: This is a diagnostic procedure used to evaluate swallowing function. It is not a disease.\n* Videofluoroscopy: This is a diagnostic procedure that uses X-ray to visualize the swallowing process. It is not a disease.\n\nConclusion:\nThere are no \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},
