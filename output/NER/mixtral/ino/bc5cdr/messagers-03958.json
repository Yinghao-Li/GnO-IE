Mammary: This term refers to the mammary glands, which are part of the female reproductive system and can be affected by certain diseases, such as breast cancer. However, in this context, it is not explicitly referring to a disease.\n2. Endometrial: This term refers to the endometrium, the lining of the uterus.
