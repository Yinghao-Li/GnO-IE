In this paragraph, there are two diseases mentioned:\n   - Rhabdomyolysis\n   - Elevation of troponin levels\n\nThese two conditions are mentioned in the context of being potentially associated with each other and with the use of statins. It is important to note that elevated troponin levels can be a sign of myocardial injury, and rhabdomyolysis is a condition that can cause muscle damage and the release of muscle contents, including myoglobin and creatine kinase, into the bloodstream."},

In this context, it is being discussed as a potential indicator of rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, the only clear disease entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Rhabdomyolysis"},

It is not a chemical in the traditional sense, but it is a biological molecule that can be measured as a marker of heart damage.\n2.

It is a synthetic chemical that works by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a key role in the production of cholesterol in the liver.\n3.
