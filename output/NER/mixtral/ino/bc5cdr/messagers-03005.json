Identify the potential disease entities: Based on the given context, the disease entities in the paragraph are likely to be related to thyroid disorders.\n3. Analyze the paragraph for specific disease entities: The paragraph mentions two lab results that are significantly outside the normal range, indicating a possible thyroid disorder. The first result is for Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is much higher than the normal range (168 uIU / mL vs. nl. 0.3 - 5 uIU / mL). The second result is for free thyroxine (FT4), which is much lower than the normal range (< 0.2 ng / dL vs. nl. 0.8 - 1.8 ng / dL).\n4. Conclude the disease entities: Based on the given paragraph, the disease entities are likely to be hypothyroidism or a related thyroid disorder, as the TSH level is elevated and the FT4 level is decreased."},
