Troponin I levels: While not a disease itself, Troponin I is a biomarker used to indicate damage to the heart muscle, often due to heart disease or injury.\n2. Delayed and peak gadolinium contrast enhancement: These are imaging findings suggestive of scarring or fibrosis in the heart muscle, which can be a result of various heart diseases such as myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathies.\n3. Histopathological grading: This refers to the assessment of tissue samples under a microscope to determine the severity and type of heart disease, such as inflammation (myocarditis), scarring (fibrosis), or infiltration (amyloidosis).\n4. Diastolic dysfunction: This is a type of heart disease where the heart muscle is unable to relax properly between beats, leading to impaired filling of the heart chambers and reduced pump function.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Scarring or fibrosis in the heart muscle\n* Various heart diseases\n* Myocardial infarction\n* Cardiomyopathies\n* Heart muscle damage\n* Inflammation (myocarditis)\n* Scarring (fibrosis)\n* Infiltration (amyloidosis)\n* Diastolic dysfunction"},
