METH: This is an abbreviation for Methamphetamine, which is a type of psychoactive drug and therefore a chemical entity.\n\nThe paragraph mentions one other chemical entity, but it is not explicitly named. Instead, it is referred to by its chemical effects:\n\n2. \"cued version of the water maze task\": This task is a behavioral experiment used to assess motor function and procedural memory in mice. The \"cued\" part of the task refers to the use of a visible cue to help the mice locate a submerged platform. The platform is often made visible by attaching a flag or other marker to it. The chemical entity in this case is the water in the maze, which is likely to be infused with a substance that affects the mice's sense of smell, making it more difficult for them to locate the platform without the visual cue. This substance is not explicitly named in the paragraph, but it is implied to be a chemical that affects the mice's olfactory senses."},
