    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. COX-2 inhibitors: These are a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that specifically inhibit the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is involved in inflammation and pain.\n2. Non-selective NSAIDs: These are a class of medications that reduce pain, inflammation, and fever by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are involved in the production of prostaglandins. Examples of non-selective NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.\n3. Cardiovascular risk: This refers to the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, stroke, or high blood pressure.\n4. Gastrointestinal benefit: This refers to the potential gastrointestinal benefits of COX-2 inhibitors, which include a lower risk of gastrointestinal side effects such as stomach ulcers and bleeding compared to non-selective NSAIDs.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs."},
