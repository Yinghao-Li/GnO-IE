While it is not a chemical, it is often used in the context of chemistry and medicine to refer to liver-related processes or disorders.\n2. Copper: This is a chemical element with the symbol Cu and atomic number 29. It is a transition metal that occurs in many minerals and is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral.\n3. Metabolism: While not a chemical itself, metabolism refers to the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms.\n4. Copper accumulation: Accumulation refers to the buildup of a substance, in this case, copper.\n5. Toxicity: This term refers to the degree to which a substance (in this case, copper) can harm living organisms.\n6. Hepatic disorders: This term refers to any liver-related diseases or abnormalities.\n7. Neurologic: This term refers to the nervous system or its functions.\n8. Psychiatric: This term refers to mental health or disorders affecting the mind.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are copper and its metabolism, accumulation, and toxicity."},
