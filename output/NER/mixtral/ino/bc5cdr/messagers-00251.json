Research and analyze each term to determine if it is a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential medical terms or conditions are:\n\n* MPO - ANCA\n* PTU\n\nLet's analyze each term:\n\n1. MPO - ANCA: MPO-ANCA stands for Myeloperoxidase Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody. It is an antibody that can be detected in the blood of patients with certain types of vasculitis, which is a group of diseases characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels. Therefore, MPO-ANCA can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n2. PTU: PTU stands for Propylthiouracil, which is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism is not a disease itself but a symptom of other conditions like Graves' disease. Therefore, PTU is not a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* MPO-ANCA"},
