It is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which means it works by blocking the action of the reverse transcriptase enzyme, thereby preventing the virus from replicating.\n2. HBIg (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin): This is a medication made from human blood plasma that contains antibodies to the hepatitis B virus. It is used to prevent HBV infection in people who have been exposed to the virus, such as through a needlestick injury or sexual contact with an infected person. In the context of liver transplantation, HBIg is often given to prevent the recurrence of HBV in the transplanted liver.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are Lamivudine and HBIg."},
