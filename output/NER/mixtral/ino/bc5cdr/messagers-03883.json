Arrhythmia\n\nThe other terms (antiarrhythmic activity, chloroform-adrenaline, BaCl2) are related to the disease but do not directly name the disease themselves."},

Experimental arrhythmia: Arrhythmia is a medical term, but in this context, it is being used in the context of experimental models, so it can be considered a \"chemical\" entity.\n3. Chloroform: This is a volatile, non-flammable, colorless liquid that is used as a general anesthetic. It is a trihalomethane, consisting of a hydrogen atom, a carbon atom, and three chlorine atoms.\n4. Adrenaline: Also known as epinephrine, this is a hormone and neurotransmitter. It is a catecholamine, which is a type of organic compound that includes both aromatic and amine functional groups.\n5. BaCl2: This is barium chloride, an inorganic compound used as a water softener and as a diagnostic aid in medicine. It consists of barium ions (Ba2+) and chloride ions (Cl-).\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are: compound, experimental arrhythmia, chloroform, adrenaline, and BaCl2."},
