Aspirin is a common name for acetylsalicylic acid, which is a medication used for pain relief, reducing inflammation, and preventing blood clots.\n2. Naproxen: This is another chemical entity that is mentioned in the paragraph. Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to treat pain, inflammation, and fever.\n3. AMI (Acute Myocardial Infarction): While not a chemical entity itself, AMI is a medical condition that can be caused by the use of certain chemicals, such as aspirin and naproxen. An AMI is a serious medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, often by a blood clot.\n4. GI (Gastrointestinal): This is a term that refers to the digestive system, which is made up of several organs that work together to break down food and extract nutrients. Certain chemicals, such as aspirin and naproxen, can irritate the lining of the stomach and intestines, leading to bleeding and other complications.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are aspirin, naproxen, and to some extent, the medical conditions AMI and GI bleeding, which can be caused by the use of these chemicals."},
