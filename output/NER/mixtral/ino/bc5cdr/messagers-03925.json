FZP: This is likely short for a specific chemical compound, but without additional context it is difficult to determine the exact name and identity of this chemical.\n2. Neural excitability: While not a specific chemical compound, neural excitability is a term used to describe the electrical and chemical activity of neurons, which is influenced by various chemical substances such as neurotransmitters.\n3. Epilepsy: This is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which can be caused by an imbalance of various chemical messengers in the brain.\n4. Sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal: This refers to the physiological and psychological effects that occur when a person stops taking sedative-hypnotic drugs, which are a class of medications that slow down the nervous system. These drugs can affect the levels of various neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to withdrawal symptoms when they are discontinued.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are FZP, neural excitability, and the various chemical messengers and neurotransmitters that are involved in epilepsy and sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal."},
