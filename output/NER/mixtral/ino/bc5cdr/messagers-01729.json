Losartan is a type of drug called an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), which is used to treat high blood pressure and other conditions.\n2.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS): While not a chemical, FSGS is a medical condition that can be caused by certain chemicals or drugs, including ADR.\n4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): This is a medical condition, not a chemical. ESRD is the final stage of chronic kidney disease, where the kidneys can no longer function properly.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Losartan and ADR (Adriamycin or doxorubicin)."},
