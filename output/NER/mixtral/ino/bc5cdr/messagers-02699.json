It is a chemical process that occurs in the brain, and it involves the strengthening of connections between neurons.\n\n3. Saline: Saline is a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water. It is often used as a control solution in scientific experiments, as it does not have any active pharmacological effects.\n\n4. Morphine: Morphine is a strong pain-relieving drug that is derived from the opium poppy.
