However, based on the context, it seems that CAA is being used as a chemical or substance that has an effect on other chemical entities.\n2. Cysteine protease activities: Cysteine proteases are a type of enzyme that break down other proteins. In this context, \"cysteine protease activities\" likely refers to the chemical reactions catalyzed by these enzymes.\n3. Thiols: Thiols are a type of chemical compound that contain a sulfhydryl group (-SH). They are often involved in redox reactions and can be found in many biological systems.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are CAA (assumed to be a chemical or substance), cysteine protease activities (chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes), and thiols (a type of chemical compound)."},
