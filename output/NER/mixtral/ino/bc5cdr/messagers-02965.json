It is a type of corticosteroid medication used to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammation, allergies, and autoimmune disorders.\n2. IOP: This stands for intraocular pressure. While not a chemical in the traditional sense, it is a measure of the pressure inside the eye, which can be affected by various chemical compounds.\n3. ER stress: This refers to endoplasmic reticulum stress, which is a cellular response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. While not a chemical itself, it is a biological process that can be influenced by various chemical compounds.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are dexamethasone and (indirectly) IOP. ER stress is not a chemical entity, but a biological process that can be influenced by chemicals."},
