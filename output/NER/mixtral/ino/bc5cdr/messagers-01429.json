Pb poisoning\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the term \"Pb poisoning\" refers to a condition where an individual has been exposed to and has elevated levels of lead in their body. Lead poisoning can cause a variety of health issues, particularly in children, and can be treated with chelating agents such as succimer. Therefore, \"Pb poisoning\" is identified as the disease entity in this paragraph."},
