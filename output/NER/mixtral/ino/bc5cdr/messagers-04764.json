Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a serious neurological disorder that can occur as a side effect of certain medications, but it is not a chemical itself. Methylphenidate, on the other hand, is a central nervous system stimulant that is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is a synthetic psychostimulant of the piperidine class, and its chemical formula is C14H19NO2. Therefore, methylphenidate is the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph."},
