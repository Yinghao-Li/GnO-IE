Ocular motility changes: These refer to alterations in the movement of the eyes, which is not a disease itself but a symptom or sign that could be associated with various diseases affecting the eye or nervous system.\n2. Subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy: Carboplatin is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various cancers, including retinoblastoma. Chemotherapy itself is not a disease but a treatment for diseases, primarily cancers.\n3. Retinoblastoma: This is a rare form of eye cancer that develops in the retina, usually affecting young children.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only identified disease entity in the paragraph is \"Retinoblastoma\"."},
