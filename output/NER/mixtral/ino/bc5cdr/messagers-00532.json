It is not a chemical in the traditional sense, but it is a biological entity that is being affected by a chemical.\n2. DMPX (3, 7 - dimethyl - 1 - propargylxanthine): This is a chemical compound that acts as a selective antagonist of the A2 adenosine receptor. It is a xanthine derivative with two methyl groups and a propargyl group attached.\n3. Cocaine: This is a powerful stimulant drug that acts on the brain's reward pathways. It is a chemical that is being used in the study described in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are DMPX and cocaine."},
