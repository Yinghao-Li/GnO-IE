Although it is not a chemical, it is often used in the context of pharmacology and physiology, so I will include it as an entity of interest.\n2. Cardiac output: This is a measure of the volume of blood being pumped by the heart per minute. It is not a chemical, but it is a key physiological parameter.\n3. Emax: This stands for Maximum Effect, which is a term used in pharmacology to describe the maximum effect that a drug can have on a particular physiological parameter. It is not a chemical, but it is a concept that is closely related to drug action.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure)\n\nNote that I have not identified any other chemical entities in the paragraph, as it does not contain any specific chemical compounds or substances."},
