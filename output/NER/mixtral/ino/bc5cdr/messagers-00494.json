Analyze each term to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph, there are two potential disease entities:\n\n1. Retinal vein occlusion\n\nTo confirm if this is a disease, let's look up the term:\nRetinal vein occlusion is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina. It is a common eye condition and a potential cause of vision loss.\n\nSince retinal vein occlusion is a recognized medical condition, it is indeed a disease entity.\n\nThe other term in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Nicergoline and bendazac lysine\n\nThese are medications and not diseases. Therefore, there is only one disease entity in the paragraph:\n\n1. Retinal vein occlusion"},
