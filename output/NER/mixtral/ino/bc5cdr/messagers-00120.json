In the given paragraph, the potential disease-related phrases are:\n * \"episodic deterioration of vision\"\n * \"clinical features resembling ischemic optic neuropathies\"\n4. Analyzing the context, we can determine that:\n * \"episodic deterioration of vision\" refers to a condition where the patient experiences periodic worsening of vision. This can be considered a symptom, but it can also be a disease on its own or a symptom of an underlying disease.\n * \"ischemic optic neuropathies\" is a specific type of disease that affects the optic nerve and is characterized by insufficient blood flow to the optic nerve.\n5. Therefore, the identified \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n * Episodic deterioration of vision (may be a symptom or a disease)\n * Ischemic optic neuropathies (confirmed disease)"},
