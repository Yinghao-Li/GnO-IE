Identify potential disease-related words or phrases in the paragraph.\n\nThe paragraph mentions the use of mice in an experiment, the injection of a drug (CY), and the assessment of its effect on the bladder. However, there are no explicit mentions of any diseases.\n\n2. Analyze the context to infer possible disease connections.\n\nThe paragraph describes an experiment where mice are injected with a drug (CY) and then assessed for bladder changes. Although no specific disease is mentioned, the context suggests that the experiment is investigating the potential effects of the drug on the bladder, which could be relevant to certain bladder conditions or diseases.\n\n3. Identify the \"Disease\" entities.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, it is not possible to explicitly identify any disease entities. However, the experiment could be related to bladder-related conditions or diseases such as bladder inflammation, bladder cancer, or interstitial cystitis. These potential disease connections are inferred from the context and not directly mentioned in the text."},
