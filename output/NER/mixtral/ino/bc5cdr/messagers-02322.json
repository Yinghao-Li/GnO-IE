It is a disease.\n* methamphetamine dependence: It is a condition in which an individual compulsively seeks and uses methamphetamine, despite the negative consequences to their physical, mental, and social well-being. It is a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. psychosis\n2. methamphetamine dependence"},
