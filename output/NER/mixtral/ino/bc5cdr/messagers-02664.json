While damage to DNA is a significant issue in the context of genetics and cellular biology, it is not a disease in and of itself. Therefore, \"DNA SBs damage\" is not a disease entity.\n* necrosis: Necrosis is the premature death of cells in living tissue, caused by external factors such as infection, trauma, or toxins. It is a pathological condition and can be considered a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the given paragraph is \"necrosis\"."},
