    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. mRNA levels of LDLr: mRNA (messenger RNA) is a type of RNA that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where it serves as a template for protein synthesis. LDLr stands for Low-Density Lipoprotein receptor, which is a protein involved in the metabolism of cholesterol.\n2. ERK1 / 2: ERK1 / 2 stands for Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, which are protein kinases that play a key role in cell signaling pathways.\n3. Protein levels of total and activated forms of ERK1 / 2: Protein refers to large molecules composed of one or more chains of amino acids. In this context, \"total\" and \"activated\" forms of ERK1 / 2 are being measured.\n4. Western blotting: Western blotting is a laboratory technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample. It involves separating proteins based on their size and then probing for the presence of a specific protein using antibodies.\n5. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a laboratory technique used to measure the amount of a specific RNA in a sample. It involves amplifying the RNA of interest and then quantifying the amount of amplified product using fluorescent dyes.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are mRNA, LDLr, ERK1 / 2, protein, and RNA."},
