Adenosine receptors are a type of receptor found in cell membranes that are activated by the neurotransmitter adenosine.\n2. Agonists of A1 receptors: These are also chemical entities that have a stronger influence on the action of cocaine. Agonists are substances that bind to a receptor and activate it, leading to a response. A1 receptors are a type of adenosine receptor.\n3. Cocaine: Although not explicitly mentioned as a \"chemical\" in the paragraph, cocaine is a chemical substance that is the subject of the study and interacts with the adenosine receptors.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are adenosine receptors, agonists of A1 receptors, and cocaine."},
