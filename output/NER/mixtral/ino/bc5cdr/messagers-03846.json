Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph \"Glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more CC than non - sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys,\" the potential disease-related phrases are \"sclerosis\" and \"non-sclerotic.\"\n\nNow let's analyze the context:\n\n1. \"Sclerosis\" refers to the hardening or scarring of an organ or tissue. In the context of this paragraph, it refers to glomerular sclerosis, which is a type of kidney disease.\n2. \"Non-sclerotic\" is a term used to describe something that does not have sclerosis. In this case, it refers to glomeruli that do not have scarring or hardening, which is the opposite of the diseased state.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Glomerular sclerosis (or simply sclerosis in this context)"},

CC: This abbreviation is not defined in the paragraph, so it is unclear what it refers to. It could potentially be a disease entity, but without further context or definition, it is impossible to determine.\n3.
