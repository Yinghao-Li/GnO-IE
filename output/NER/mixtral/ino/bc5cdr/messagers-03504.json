Research or examine the context of each phrase to determine if it represents a disease.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related phrases:\n\n* ischaemic models\n* nephrotoxic models\n* acute renal failure (ARF)\n\nStep 2: Examining the context and determining if it represents a disease:\n\n* Ischaemic models: This phrase refers to models of ischaemia, which is a condition of reduced blood supply to tissues or organs, causing a shortage of oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism. Ischaemia is a pathological condition, not a disease itself, but it can lead to various diseases depending on the affected organ or tissue. In this context, ischaemic models refer to experimental conditions created to study the effects of ischaemia on the kidney.\n* Nephrotoxic models: Nephrotoxicity refers to the kidney's adverse reaction to various substances, leading to damage or dysfunction. Nephrotoxic models are experimental conditions created to study the effects of nephrotoxic substances on the kidney. Like ischaemic models, nephrotoxic models are not diseases but experimental setups to investigate potential kidney damage or disease.\n* Acute renal failure (ARF): Acute renal failure, also known as acute kidney injury (AKI), is a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or a few days. AKI can cause waste products to accumulate in the body, disrupting the balance of electrolytes and reducing the removal of fluids. AKI is a disease and a serious condition requiring medical intervention.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Acute renal failure (ARF) or Acute kidney injury (AKI)"},
