Therefore, \"memory impairment\" can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n5. However, it's important to note that \"memory impairment\" is a symptom rather than a disease itself.\n6. The paragraph also mentions \"castration-induced memory impairment.\"\n7. Castration is a medical procedure, but the resulting memory impairment can be considered a disease entity.\n8.
