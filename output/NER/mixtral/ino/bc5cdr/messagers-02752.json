Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n\n* lethal doses of bupivacaine\n* bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the context:\n\n* Lethal doses of bupivacaine: Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic, and in this context, \"lethal doses\" refers to the amount of the drug that can cause death. While bupivacaine itself is not a disease, an overdose or toxic levels of the drug can lead to various health issues, such as cardiac arrest, which can be fatal.\n\n* Bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity: Cardiotoxicity refers to the toxic effect of a substance on the heart. In this case, bupivacaine is the substance causing the toxicity. Cardiotoxicity can lead to various heart conditions, such as arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and even cardiac arrest, which can be life-threatening.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Bupivacaine toxicity or overdose\n2. Cardiotoxicity (specifically, bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity)"},
