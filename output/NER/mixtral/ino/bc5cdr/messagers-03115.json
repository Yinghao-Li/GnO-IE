Myocardial infarction: Also known as a heart attack, this is a serious medical condition that occurs when blood flow to the heart is blocked, often by a blood clot. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition.\n3. Inflammatory responses: Inflammation is a biological response to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens or damaged cells. It involves the activation of the immune system and the release of various chemical mediators.\n4. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK): This is an enzyme that plays a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism. It is activated in response to changes in the AMP:ATP ratio, which occurs during periods of energy depletion.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are metformin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)."},
