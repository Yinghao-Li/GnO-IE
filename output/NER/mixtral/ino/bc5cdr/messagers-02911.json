Numbness is a symptom, not a disease itself, but it can indicate the presence of a disease or condition.\n2. The numbness is located in the \"lower extremities,\" which typically refers to the legs and feet.\n\nWhile \"numbness\" is not a disease, it can be a symptom of various diseases or conditions affecting the nervous system, such as peripheral neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, or a spinal cord injury. In this context, \"numbness in her lower extremities\" is used to describe a symptom, which could potentially indicate an underlying disease or condition."},
