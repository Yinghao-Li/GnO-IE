Myocardial infarction refers to a heart attack, and recurrent indicates that the patient has experienced more than one such event.\n2. Postpartum: This term refers to the period following childbirth. While not a disease itself, it is often associated with certain medical conditions, such as postpartum depression or, in this case, a postpartum patient experiencing recurrent myocardial infarction.\n3. Bromocriptine: This is a medication used to treat various conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, pituitary tumors, and, in some cases, to suppress lactation after childbirth. While not a disease, it is relevant to the paragraph as it is being administered to the patient experiencing recurrent myocardial infarction.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"Recurrent myocardial infarction\" and, indirectly, \"postpartum,\" which sets the context for the patient's medical condition."},
