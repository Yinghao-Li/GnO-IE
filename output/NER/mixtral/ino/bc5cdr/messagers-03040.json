In this case, there are no specific chemical compounds or substances mentioned by name.\n2. However, we can infer that the paragraph is discussing the use of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in the assessment of drug potential for QT prolongation.\n3. QT prolongation is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle, which can be affected by certain drugs.\n4. Therefore, while there are no specific chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph, the topic itself is related to the field of chemistry, specifically pharmaceutical chemistry and drug development.\n\nAnswer: There are no specific \"chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph, but the topic relates to pharmaceutical chemistry and drug development."},
