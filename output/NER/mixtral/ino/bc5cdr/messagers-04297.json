Analyze the context to confirm they are indeed chemical entities.\n\nIn the paragraph you provided:\n\nThe two drugs may act synergistically on both the AV node and the peripheral circulation.\n\nThere are two chemical entities mentioned:\n\n1. The first chemical entity is \"drugs\". In this context, it refers to chemical substances used in medical treatment.\n2. The second chemical entity is implied, which is the \"AV node\" modifier. AV node stands for atrioventricular node, a part of the electrical conduction system in the heart. While not a chemical itself, it is often targeted by certain drugs, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis, to control heart rate.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"drugs\" and the \"AV node\" modifier, which is often targeted by certain drugs."},
