Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph \"Chronic administration of estrogen to the Fischer 344 (F344) rat induces growth of large, hemorrhagic pituitary tumors,\" the potential disease-related words or phrases are:\n\n* Chronic administration\n* estrogen\n* growth\n* large\n* hemorrhagic\n* pituitary tumors\n\nAnalyzing the context of each word or phrase:\n\n* Chronic administration: This refers to the continuous or prolonged use of a substance, in this case, estrogen. It is not a disease.\n* Estrogen: This is a hormone and not a disease.\n* Growth: While growth can be a natural process, in this context, it refers to the abnormal enlargement of an organ or tissue (the pituitary gland) due to the presence of a tumor.\n* Large: This is a descriptor and not a disease.\n* Hemorrhagic: This is a descriptor indicating the presence of bleeding. It is not a disease.\n* Pituitary tumors: These are abnormal growths in the pituitary gland. They can be benign or malignant and can cause various health issues, depending on their size and location. Pituitary tumors are considered a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Pituitary tumors"},
