Analyze each potential chemical entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text are:\n\n* Reduction\n* Fluoxetine\n* 5 - FU\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each potential chemical entity:\n\n* Reduction: In this context, reduction refers to a process or a reaction, not a specific chemical.\n* Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used as an antidepressant. It is a well-known pharmaceutical drug and thus a chemical.\n* 5 - FU: This is an abbreviation for 5-Fluorouracil, an antimetabolite medication used in cancer treatment. It is a chemical.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are Fluoxetine and 5 - FU (5-Fluorouracil)."},
