Disruptions in glucose metabolism can lead to diabetes mellitus.\n* risk factors for diabetes: These are factors that increase the likelihood of developing diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, physical inactivity, and family history.\n\nAll the identified entities are related to diseases, so the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* diabetes mellitus\n* schizophrenia\n* atypical antipsychotic agents (indirectly related to the potential side effect of increased risk of diabetes)\n* glucose metabolism (related to the development of diabetes)\n* risk factors for diabetes"},
