Hypotension: This term refers to abnormally low blood pressure. It is a disease or medical condition, so it is a \"Disease\" entity.\n2. Tachy-: This is a prefix meaning \"fast\" and is often used in medical terminology. In this context, it is part of the term \"tachycardia\", which refers to a fast heart rate. However, on its own, \"tachy-\" does not refer to a disease.\n3. Bradycardia: This term refers to an abnormally slow heart rate. It is a disease or medical condition, so it is a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"hypotension\" and \"bradycardia\"."},
