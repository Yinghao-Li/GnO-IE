    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Propofol: This is a chemical entity used as an intravenous general anesthetic.\n2. Remifentanil: This is a chemical entity used as a potent opioid analgesic, often used in combination with propofol for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA).\n3. Intraoperative bleeding: While not a chemical entity itself, this term refers to the loss of blood during surgery, which can be influenced by various chemical factors such as blood pressure and anesthesia.\n4. Intraoperative blood pressure: This term refers to the blood pressure measured during surgery, which can be influenced by various chemical factors such as anesthesia and medications.\n5. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS): This is a surgical procedure, not a chemical entity, but it is important to note as it is the context of the study.\n6. Flexible reinforced laryngeal mask airway (FRLMA): This is a medical device used during anesthesia, not a chemical entity, but it is important to note as it is one of the interventions being compared in the study.\n7. Endotracheal tube (ETT): This is another medical device used during anesthesia, not a chemical entity, but it is the other intervention being compared in the study.\n8. Controlled hypotension anesthesia: This is a technique used in anesthesia to reduce blood pressure in a controlled manner, which can help reduce intraoperative bleeding. It is not a chemical entity itself, but it is induced by the chemical entities propofol and remifentanil in this study.\n9. Total i.v. anesthesia (TIVA): This is a type of anesthesia in which all anesthetic drugs are administered intravenously, as is the case in this study with propofol and remifentanil. It is not a chemical entity itself, but it is important to note as it is the method of anesthesia used in the study."},
