The potential disease-related words or phrases are \"BP reductions,\" \"hypokalemia,\" and \"monotherapy.\"\n2. \"BP reductions\" refers to a decrease in blood pressure, not a disease.\n3. \"Hypokalemia\" is a condition characterized by low potassium levels in the blood, so it is a disease.\n4. \"Monotherapy\" is a term used to describe the use of a single drug or treatment, not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the only \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is \"hypokalemia.\""},
