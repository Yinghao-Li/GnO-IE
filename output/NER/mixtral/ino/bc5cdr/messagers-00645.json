Candidate words/phrases: levodopa, 813 mg, 359 mg\n2. Verification:\n* levodopa: It is a medication and a type of amino acid, so it is a chemical entity.\n* 813 mg, 359 mg: These are units of measurement for mass, often used for chemical substances. However, in this context, they are just numerical values and not chemical entities themselves.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"levodopa.\""},
