If a term refers to a disease, then it is a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nApplying this process to the paragraph:\n\n1. The potential medical terms in the paragraph are \"Radiolabelling,\" \"in vivo injection,\" \"3H - 17 beta estradiol,\" \"tumor cells,\" and \"nuclei.\"\n2. Researching each term, we find that \"tumor cells\" are a type of abnormal cell growth characterized by uncontrolled cell division and the ability to invade surrounding tissues. Tumors can be benign or malignant, and malignant tumors are cancerous.\n3. Therefore, \"tumor cells\" is a \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph.\n\nNote: The other terms in the paragraph are related to medical research techniques and do not refer to diseases."},
