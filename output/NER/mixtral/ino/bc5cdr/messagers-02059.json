CCR2 is involved in the immune response and inflammation. In this context, CCR2 is being discussed in relation to its observed increase in the hippocampus after SE (status epilepticus), which suggests its role in the neurological response to seizures.\n\nTherefore, CCR2 is indeed a chemical entity."},
