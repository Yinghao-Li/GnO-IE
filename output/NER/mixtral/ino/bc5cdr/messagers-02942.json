Elevated levels of cTnI in the blood can indicate damage to the heart muscle, which can be a sign of various heart diseases, such as myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Myocardial contrast enhancement and the potential diseases that can be diagnosed or monitored using this technique, as well as the elevated cTnI levels that can indicate heart muscle damage."},
