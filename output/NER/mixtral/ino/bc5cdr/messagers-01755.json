It is a synthetic catecholamine used as a drug, often in the form of its sulfate salt, to treat bradycardia, heart block, and heart failure.\n2. Circulating glucose: Glucose is a simple sugar that is an important energy source in living organisms. It is a chemical entity.\n3. Lactate: This is a chemical entity. It is a chemical compound that is produced when there is not enough oxygen to break down glucose or glycogen.\n4. Free fatty acids: These are chemical entities. They are fatty acids that are not bound to glycerol, and they play a key role in lipid metabolism.\n5. (-) - propranolol: This is a chemical entity. It is a non-selective beta blocker used to treat high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, and other conditions.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are isoprenaline, circulating glucose, lactate, free fatty acids, and (-) - propranolol."},
