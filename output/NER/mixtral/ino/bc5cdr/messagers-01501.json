Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. It is a disease.\n2. A seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. It is a symptom, not a disease itself, but it can indicate an underlying disease or condition, such as epilepsy.\n\nSince \"epileptic\" is an adjective describing a specific type of seizure, and \"seizure activity\" refers to the occurrence of seizures, both phrases are related to the disease epilepsy.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
