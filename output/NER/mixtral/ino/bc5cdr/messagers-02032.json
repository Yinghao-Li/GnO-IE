HD-MTX therapy: Although not explicitly stated, \"HD-MTX\" likely refers to high-dose methotrexate therapy, which is a treatment for certain types of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic drug that can have side effects, including kidney damage.\n3. Ileostomy: This is not a disease, but rather a surgical procedure in which an opening is made in the abdominal wall to allow the passage of waste from the ileum (the last part of the small intestine) into a bag outside the body. However, having an ileostomy can increase the risk of certain medical conditions, such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\n4. Congenital biliary atresia: This is a rare, life-threatening liver disease that affects newborns. It is characterized by the absence or abnormal formation of the bile ducts, which can lead to liver damage and failure.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Acute renal failure\n* Congenital biliary atresia"},
