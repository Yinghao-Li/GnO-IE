It is a chemical entity mentioned in the context of intravascular fibrin thrombi and the pathogenesis of fibrin thrombi in patients with certain disorders.\n2.

It is mentioned as a drug that should not be implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrin thrombi in patients with certain disorders.\n3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation: This is a serious medical condition that can occur in response to a variety of triggers, including infection, trauma, or cancer. It is characterized by the formation of blood clots throughout the body, which can lead to organ damage. It is mentioned as a type of \"consumption coagulopathy\" in which fibrin thrombi may be observed.\n4. Coagulopathies: This is a general term for any disorder that affects the normal clotting of blood. It is mentioned in the context of fibrin thrombi and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n5. Renal artery: This is a blood vessel that supplies blood to the kidneys. It is mentioned in the context of thrombosis, or the formation of a blood clot within the vessel.\n6. Thrombosis: This is the formation of a blood clot within a blood vessel. It is mentioned in the context of the renal artery and the kidney.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are fibrin, EACA, and thrombosis."},
