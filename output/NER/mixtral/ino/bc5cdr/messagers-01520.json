Analyze the context to ensure that the identified words or phrases refer to a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there is one disease mentioned:\n\n* BCNU (carmustine) -induced cortical dysplasia\n\nCortical dysplasia is a type of neurological disorder that affects the structure and function of the brain's cortex. BCNU, also known as carmustine, is a chemotherapy drug that can cause cortical dysplasia as a side effect. In this study, the focus is on the neuroprotective effects of melatonin on the offspring cerebellar cortex in the context of BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia."},
