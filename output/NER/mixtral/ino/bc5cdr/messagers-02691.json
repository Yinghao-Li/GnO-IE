Analyze each potential chemical entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text:\n\n* Histamine\n* d - tubocurarine\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each potential chemical entity:\n\n* Histamine: Histamine is a biogenic amine that functions as a neurotransmitter and plays a role in local immune responses. It is a well-known chemical involved in allergic reactions.\n* d - tubocurarine: d-tubocurarine is a type of curare, a plant alkaloid, which is a naturally occurring organic compound containing mostly basic nitrogen atoms. It is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, used in anesthesia to induce paralysis of skeletal muscles.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Histamine\n2. d - tubocurarine"},
