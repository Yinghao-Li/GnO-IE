Lithium: This is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. In medicine, lithium salts are used as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of bipolar disorder.\n\nThe term \"hyperparathyroidism\" refers to a medical condition, not a chemical entity. It is a disorder of the parathyroid glands, which are four small glands located in the neck that produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). Hyperparathyroidism occurs when one or more of the parathyroid glands produces too much PTH, leading to high levels of calcium in the blood."},
