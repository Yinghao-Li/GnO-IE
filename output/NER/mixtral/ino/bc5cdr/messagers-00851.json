Myocardial injury can be a result of various diseases, such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) or myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle).\n* isoproterenol: This is a medication used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate) and heart block. However, in higher doses, it can induce myocardial injury by increasing heart rate and contractility, leading to ischemia (reduced blood flow) and eventually necrosis (cell death) of the heart muscle.\n\nDisease entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. Myocardial injury\n2. (Potentially) myocardial infarction or myocarditis, as possible underlying causes of myocardial injury\n\nNote: The paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific diseases, but it discusses myocardial injury, which can be a consequence of various heart conditions."},
