The text is discussing a medical treatment (levetiracetam) and its effect on seizure frequency in cats.\n\n2. Based on this context, we can identify \"seizures\" as the primary \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph. Seizures are a medical condition and a common symptom of various neurological disorders.\n\n3. Although the text does not explicitly mention any specific disease causing the seizures, the focus of the paragraph is on seizure frequency and its reduction due to treatment with levetiracetam.\n\nTherefore, the identified \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Seizures"},
