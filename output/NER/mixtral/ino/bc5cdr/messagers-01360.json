Jaundice: This is a yellowing of the skin, whites of the eyes, and mucous membranes caused by an excess of bilirubin in the blood. Jaundice can be a symptom of various medical conditions, including liver diseases such as hepatitis, or blood disorders such as hemolysis.\n3. Arrhythmia (premature ventricular contraction): This is a type of abnormal heart rhythm or heartbeat. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra beats that originate in the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart) and cause the heart to beat earlier than normal.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are severe malaria, jaundice, and arrhythmia (premature ventricular contraction)."},
