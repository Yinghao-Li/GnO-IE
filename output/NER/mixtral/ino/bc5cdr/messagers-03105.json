Potential disease-related words or phrases: \"Ca (2+) overload\", \"accelerated beating rhythm\", \"arrhythmia\"\n2. Researching or analyzing the context of each word or phrase:\n * \"Ca (2+) overload\": While calcium (Ca) is an essential element for the body, an overload can lead to various health issues, including heart problems. However, \"Ca (2+) overload\" is not a disease itself but a condition that can contribute to diseases.\n * \"accelerated beating rhythm\": This phrase describes an abnormal heart rhythm, which can be a symptom of various heart diseases.\n * \"arrhythmia\": Arrhythmia is a general term for an irregular heartbeat or heart rhythm, which can be caused by various underlying heart conditions or diseases.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n* \"Ca (2+) overload\" is not a disease but a contributing factor to diseases.\n* \"accelerated beating rhythm\" and \"arrhythmia\" are symptoms or conditions associated with heart diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Implicitly mentioned heart diseases that can be caused by \"Ca (2+) overload\", resulting in \"accelerated beating rhythm\" and \"arrhythmia\"."},
