Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH): This is a condition where there is an excessive release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland or other sources. ADH is a hormone that helps regulate water balance in the body.\n3. Vincristine: This is a chemical compound that is used as a medication, specifically as an antineoplastic agent for the treatment of various types of cancer.\n4.
