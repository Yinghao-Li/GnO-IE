Central nervous system (CNS) toxic effect: This is a general condition or symptom that can be caused by various diseases, but in this context, it is mentioned as a possible mechanism of the case, so it's worth noting.\n3. Paradoxical epileptogenic effect: This is a specific type of CNS effect that can be caused by certain medications, including valproic acid, and can lead to seizures or epilepsy. It is worth noting as a disease entity.\n4. Hyperammonemia: This is a medical condition characterized by an excess of ammonia in the blood. It is worth noting as a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Paradoxical epileptogenic effect\n* Hyperammonemia"},
