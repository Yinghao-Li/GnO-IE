Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nStep 1: The potential disease-related words or phrases in the paragraph are:\n\n* Flecainide\n* susceptible patients\n* delirium\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the context of each word or phrase:\n\n* Flecainide: It is a medication used to treat certain types of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). It is not a disease.\n* Susceptible patients: This refers to individuals who are prone to experiencing adverse effects from certain medications, in this case, delirium caused by Flecainide and similar agents. It does not refer to a disease.\n* Delirium: It is a serious disturbance in mental abilities that results in confused thinking and reduced awareness of the environment. Delirium can be caused by various factors, including certain medications like Flecainide. Therefore, delirium is a disease in this context.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Delirium"},
