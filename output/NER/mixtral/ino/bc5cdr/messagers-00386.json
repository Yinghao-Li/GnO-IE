Endometrial prostaglandins: These are chemical compounds that are produced by the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) and play a role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle. They are classified as eicosanoids and are synthesized from fatty acids.\n2. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These are a class of medications that are used to reduce pain, inflammation, and fever.
