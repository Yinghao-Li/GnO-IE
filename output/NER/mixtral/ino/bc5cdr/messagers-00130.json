In the given paragraph, the two potential medical conditions are:\n * ECG abnormalities\n * conduction defects\n4. ECG (Exercise Cardiovascular Graph) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. Abnormalities in ECG results may indicate various heart conditions. Hence, 'ECG abnormalities' can be considered a disease entity.\n5. 'Conduction defects' refer to issues with the heart's electrical pathways, which can lead to various heart diseases. Therefore, 'conduction defects' can also be considered a disease entity.\n\nAnswer: The disease entities in the paragraph are 'ECG abnormalities' and 'conduction defects'."},
