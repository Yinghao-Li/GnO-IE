In this case, Viracept is a specific protease inhibitor used to treat HIV.\n2. Viracept: This is a brand name for the chemical compound nelfinavir mesylate, which is a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV.\n3. HIV: This is a retrovirus that attacks the immune system and can lead to AIDS. It is not a chemical, but I included it because it is often associated with the use of antiretroviral drugs like Viracept.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"protease inhibitor\" and \"Viracept\" (nelfinavir mesylate)."},
