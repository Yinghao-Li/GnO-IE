It is a glycopeptide antibacterial derived from fermentation of Amycolatopsis orientalis.\n2. Levofloxacin: This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, used to treat a number of bacterial infections. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth.\n3. Piperacillin / Tazobactam: This is a combination of two antibiotics used to treat a wide variety of infections. Piperacillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic and Tazobactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are vancomycin, levofloxacin, piperacillin, and tazobactam."},
