Analyze the context of each term to determine if it is being used as a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential disease-related terms are:\n\n* Indomethacin\n* hypotension\n* sodium depletion\n\nNow, let's analyze the context of each term:\n\n1. Indomethacin: It is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. It is not a disease.\n2. Hypotension: It is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood pressure, often resulting in inadequate blood flow to the brain and other vital organs. Hypotension is a disease when it occurs abnormally or as a result of another medical condition. In this paragraph, hypotension is used in the context of being induced by Indomethacin, so it can be considered a disease in this context.\n3. Sodium depletion: It is a condition that occurs when the body loses too much sodium, often due to excessive sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea. Sodium depletion is not a disease itself but a physiological state that can lead to various health issues. In this paragraph, sodium depletion is mentioned as a factor contributing to the development of hypotension, so it is not a disease in this context.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypotension"},

Hypotension: While not a chemical, it is important to note that hypotension is a condition and not a chemical entity. It refers to abnormally low blood pressure.\n3. Sodium: This is a chemical element (specifically, a metal) and a crucial electrolyte for the human body.\n4. Volume depleted: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a description of a physiological state where the body has reduced fluid volume.\n\nSo, in the given paragraph, the only chemical entity is Indomethacin."},
