Norepinephrine: This is a neurotransmitter and hormone that is secreted by the adrenal glands and is involved in the body's fight-or-flight response. It is a chemical entity.\n3. ET-1: This is a shorthand notation for endothelin-1, which is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide produced by endothelial cells. It is a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are norepinephrine and ET-1 (endothelin-1)."},
