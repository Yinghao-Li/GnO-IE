Serum bFGF: bFGF stands for basic Fibroblast Growth Factor, which is a type of protein that stimulates the growth of cells and is therefore considered a growth factor.

It is also considered a growth factor and is therefore a chemical entity.\n3. PSA: PSA stands for Prostate-Specific Antigen, which is a protein produced by the cells of the prostate gland. It is not a chemical entity in the same sense as bFGF and VEGF, but it is a chemical substance that is used as a clinical marker for prostate cancer.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are serum bFGF and VEGF."},
