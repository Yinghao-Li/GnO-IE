EPS: This is an abbreviation for Extrapyramidal Symptoms, which are a group of side effects that can occur with certain medications, particularly antipsychotic medications. These symptoms can include stiffness, tremors, and difficulty with movement. EPS are not a chemical entity in the same way that a compound like water or glucose is a chemical, but they are related to the action of neurotransmitters in the brain, so they can be considered chemical in a broader sense.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are DRD2 and EPS."},
