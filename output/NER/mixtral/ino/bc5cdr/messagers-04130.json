They are capable of identifying and binding to specific antigens, which helps the body to neutralize or eliminate the harmful substances.\n2. IgM: This is a class of antibodies that are the first to be produced in response to an antigen. IgM antibodies are large, pentameric proteins that are primarily found in the blood and lymph fluid. They are important for initiating the immune response and activating complement, a group of proteins that help to destroy pathogens.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are antibodies and IgM. However, it's worth noting that while antibodies are composed of proteins, which are chemical compounds, they are not typically referred to as \"chemicals\" in the way that simpler molecules like water or glucose might be. Instead, they are often referred to as biological molecules or biomolecules."},

They are composed of amino acids, which are simple organic compounds that are the building blocks of proteins.\n\nTherefore, the relevant chemical entity in the paragraph is antibodies. While IgM is a class of antibodies, it is not a chemical in and of itself, but rather a category of antibodies with similar properties."},
