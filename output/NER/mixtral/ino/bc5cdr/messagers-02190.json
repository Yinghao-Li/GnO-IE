MitoQ is a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant that has been shown to have protective effects against mitochondrial abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction.\n\n2. Antioxidant: This is a general category of chemicals that inhibit oxidation. MitoQ is a specific type of antioxidant that is targeted to mitochondria.\n\n3. Diastolic dysfunction: This is a medical condition, but it is often associated with certain chemicals or drugs that can affect heart function.\n\n4. Pressure-volume data: This is a type of data that is collected using a conductance catheter, which is a medical device used to measure the pressure and volume of the heart. While not a chemical entity itself, this data may be used to study the effects of chemical entities on heart function.\n\nOverall, the chemical entities in this paragraph are MitoQ and antioxidant."},
