In this context, it is referring to a negative effect on the health of the kidney, so we can consider it a disease entity.\n* Most patients implies a group of individuals affected by a condition, which in this case is the proximal tubular damage. Therefore, it is related to the disease.\n* Glomerular or tubular dysfunction refers to impaired function in another part of the kidney. Like proximal tubular damage, it is a negative effect on the health of the kidney and can be considered a disease entity.\n\nDisease entities:\n\n* Proximal tubular damage\n* Glomerular or tubular dysfunction"},
