Analyzing each condition:\n * Diabetes: This is a disease characterized by high blood sugar levels caused by the body's inability to produce or use insulin effectively.\n * Peripheral neuropathy: This is a disease or damage to the peripheral nerves, often causing numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet.\n * Autonomic neuropathy: This is a disease affecting the autonomic nerves, which control involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.\n * Chest pain: While chest pain can be a symptom of various conditions, it can also be a disease entity itself, such as angina or a myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Diabetes\n2. Peripheral neuropathy\n3. Autonomic neuropathy\n4. Chest pain (potentially angina or myocardial infarction)"},
