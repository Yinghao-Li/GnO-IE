In this paragraph, the word \"cocaine\" is repeated several times and is associated with the three groups of participants.\n3. \"Cocaine\" is a substance that can be abused and lead to various health problems, including addiction, which can be considered a disease.\n4. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n * Cocaine naive participants (CN)\n * Occasional cocaine (OC)\n * Regular recreational cocaine (RC) users\n\nNote: While \"cocaine use\" or \"cocaine addiction\" might be more accurate descriptions of the disease entities, the paragraph does not explicitly mention these conditions.
