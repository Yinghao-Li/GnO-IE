In this case, the paragraph mentions \"alpha and beta adrenoceptor densities.\"\n2. Adrenoceptors are a type of receptor that binds catecholamines, which are a class of chemicals that include hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline.\n3. Therefore, the chemical entities in this paragraph are:\n * Adrenoceptors (alpha and beta)\n * Catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the paragraph only explicitly mentions adrenoceptors, and not catecholamines. Therefore, the only clear chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is adrenoceptors."},
