In this case, the paragraph mentions a \"compound\" and its \"doses\" given in specific quantities.\n2. The name of the compound is \"P11.\"\n3. The paragraph also mentions the units of measurement for the doses, which are \"mg/kg,\" indicating that the compound is measured in milligrams per kilogram of body weight.\n4. Finally, the paragraph specifies the route of administration for the compound, which is either intravenous or oral.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* P11 (the name of the compound)\n* 0.25 mg/kg and 0.50 mg/kg (the intravenous doses of the compound)\n* 10 mg/kg (the oral dose of the compound)\n\nThese entities are all related to the chemical compound P11 and its administration to a subject."},
