CNSB002: This is likely a specific chemical compound being studied, although I could not find specific information on it. In general, when looking for chemical entities, new or experimental compounds are often prefixed with letters to denote their source or type.\n3. Carrageenan: This is a chemical compound derived from red seaweed, used in scientific research as a model for inflammation.\n4. Streptozotocin (STZ): This is a chemical compound used in scientific research to induce diabetes in laboratory animals.\n5. Noxious heat: While not a chemical entity itself, it is important to note that \"noxious heat\" is a stimulus being applied in the experiment.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are: Morphine, CNSB002, Carrageenan, and Streptozotocin (STZ)."},
