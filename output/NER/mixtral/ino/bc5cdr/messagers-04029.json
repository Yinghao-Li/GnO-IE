Research or use prior knowledge to determine if they are indeed diseases.\n\nIn the paragraph \"Ascites and hydrothorax were observed simultaneously\", the potential disease-related words are:\n\n1. Ascites\n2. Hydrothorax\n\nNow, let's determine if they are actual diseases:\n\n1. Ascites: According to medical resources, ascites is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. It is not a disease itself but a symptom of various medical conditions, such as liver cirrhosis, heart failure, or cancer.\n2. Hydrothorax: Medical resources define hydrothorax as an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space (the space between the lungs and the chest wall). Similar to ascites, hydrothorax is not a disease but a symptom of various medical conditions, such as heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. A symptom of various medical conditions - Ascites\n2. A symptom of various medical conditions - Hydrothorax"},
