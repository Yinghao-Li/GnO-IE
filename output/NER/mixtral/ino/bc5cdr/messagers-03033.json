To provide you with a paragraph that contains chemical entities, here's an example:\n\nParagraph: The new drug, Naltrexone, was tested for its ability to block opioid receptors in the brain. The experiment involved administering Naltrexone to mice and measuring the levels of endorphins, a type of neurotransmitter, in their brains. The results showed that Naltrexone effectively blocked the opioid receptors and reduced the levels of endorphins.\n\nIn this paragraph, the chemical entities are:\n\n1. Naltrexone\n2. opioid receptors\n3. brain\n4. endorphins\n5. neurotransmitter"},
