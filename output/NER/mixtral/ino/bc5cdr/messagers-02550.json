The \"chemical\" entities in this paragraph would be the medical terms related to substances or compounds that are used or produced in the body during the procedure or mentioned in the results. However, in this particular paragraph, there are no explicit \"chemical\" entities mentioned.\n\nThe paragraph refers to a medical procedure called \"emergent coronary angiogram,\" which is a diagnostic test used to visualize the coronary arteries. The results of the test indicate that the patient's coronary arteries are normal, but there is a moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS.\n\nTS is an abbreviation for Takotsubo syndrome, also known as broken heart syndrome, which is a condition that affects the left ventricle of the heart.
