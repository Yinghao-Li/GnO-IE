It refers to an electrocardiogram (ECG) that records the electrical activity of the heart from the surface of the chest, which includes the transmission of electrical signals through the heart muscle wall (transmural).\n4. Arterially perfused: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the process of delivering a fluid, such as blood or a nutrient solution, to an organ or tissue through its arteries.\n5.

They refer to the left ventricle of a dog or rabbit heart that has been prepared for study, typically by removing some or all of the surrounding tissue.\n\nIn summary, there are no chemical entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
