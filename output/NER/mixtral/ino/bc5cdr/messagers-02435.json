Sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs): These are not chemical entities in the traditional sense, but they do involve genetic material and are often studied in the context of genetic research. Therefore, they can be considered related to chemistry, specifically genetics and biochemistry.\n2. Proliferation rate index (PRI): This is not a chemical entity either, but rather a measure used in cell biology and genetics. It is not a chemical substance.\n3. Mitotic Index: This is also a measure used in cell biology and genetics, and is not a chemical substance.\n\nIn summary, the only term in the paragraph that might be considered related to chemistry is \"sister chromatid exchanges,\" but it is not a chemical entity in the traditional sense.
