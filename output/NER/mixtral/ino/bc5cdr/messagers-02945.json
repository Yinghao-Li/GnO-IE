It is not a specific disease but a symptom or condition that can be associated with various medical disorders.\n* allodynia: This term refers to the perception of pain from a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain. Similar to hyperalgesia, it is not a specific disease but a symptom or condition that can be associated with various medical disorders.\n* clinical pain disorders: This term refers to medical conditions or diseases that involve pain as a primary symptom. It is a broader category that includes various specific diseases and conditions.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the various unspecified \"clinical pain disorders\" that can involve symptoms like hyperalgesia and allodynia."},
