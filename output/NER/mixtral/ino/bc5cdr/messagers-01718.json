This is implied in the phrase \"antihypertensive effects,\" which refers to the effects of a treatment that lowers blood pressure.\n2. The second disease mentioned is \"renal disease,\" which is a general term for any condition that affects the kidneys.\n3. The third disease mentioned is \"nephropathy,\" which is a specific type of kidney disease or damage.\n4. The fourth disease mentioned is \"adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy,\" which is a kidney disease that can be caused by the chemotherapy drug adriamycin (also known as doxorubicin).\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are hypertension, renal disease, nephropathy, and adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy."},

Angiotensin II type - 1 receptor blocker: This is a type of medication that blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow, by preventing it from binding to its receptor.\n2. Losartan: This is a specific type of angiotensin II receptor blocker, which is being investigated in the study for its antihypertensive effects and potential in slowing down renal disease progression.\n3. Adriamycin (ADR): This is a chemotherapy medication used to treat various types of cancer. In the context of the study, it is used to induce nephropathy (kidney disease) in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\n4. Nephropathy: This is a general term for kidney disease or damage. In the study, it is induced by the chemotherapy medication adriamycin.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are angiotensin II type - 1 receptor blocker, losartan, adriamycin (ADR), and nephropathy."},
