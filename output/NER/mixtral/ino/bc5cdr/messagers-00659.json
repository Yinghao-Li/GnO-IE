It is a well-known and well-defined disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the given paragraph is:\n\n* retinoblastoma"},

Carboplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent used to treat various types of cancer, including retinoblastoma. It is administered in a subtenon manner, which means it is delivered via an injection into the subtenon space of the eye."},
