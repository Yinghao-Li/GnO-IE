Pharmacodynamics: This refers to the study of the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs on the body, their mechanisms, interactions, and influences on the body's organs and systems. It is not a chemical itself, but a process involving chemicals.\n2. Hypotensive effect: This is a physiological effect of a chemical substance, in this case, a decrease in blood pressure.\n3. Levodopa: This is a chemical compound with the formula L-DOPA or C9H11NO4. It is a precursor to the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. It is used as a medication to treat Parkinson's disease.\n4. Parkinsonian patients: These are individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The disease is associated with the depletion of dopamine in the brain.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Pharmacodynamics (process involving chemicals)\n* Hypotensive effect (physiological effect of a chemical substance)\n* Levodopa (a chemical compound)"},
