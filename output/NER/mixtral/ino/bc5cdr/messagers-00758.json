Respiratory and cardiovascular effects: These are physiological responses to chemical substances (usually drugs or toxins) that affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.\n4. Pain on injection: This is a subjective experience that can be caused by the chemical substance being injected (usually a drug) or by the injection process itself.\n\nSo, while the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific chemical substances, it does refer to several chemical processes and effects."},
