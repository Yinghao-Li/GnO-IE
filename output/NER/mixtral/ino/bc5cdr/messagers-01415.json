They can be caused by a variety of factors, including the drug itself, the patient's underlying medical condition, or other factors.\n2. \"hematology\" - This is a branch of medicine that deals with the study of blood and blood-forming tissues. It involves the examination of various components of the blood, such as red and white blood cells, platelets, and clotting factors.\n3. \"blood chemistry\" - Also known as clinical chemistry, this is a branch of laboratory medicine that deals with the analysis of blood and other bodily fluids to determine the concentration of various chemicals and other substances. This can include electrolytes, enzymes, hormones, and drugs, among other things.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are \"blood chemistry\" and the various substances that are analyzed as part of a blood chemistry test."},
