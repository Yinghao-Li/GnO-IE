Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease:\n- Control group: This term refers to a group of subjects that does not receive any treatment and serves as a basis for comparison. It does not directly refer to a disease.\n- Model group: This term refers to a group of subjects that receive a specific treatment to mimic a disease condition. Here, the model group is injected with CYP, which may indicate that CYP is related to a disease condition.\n- Intervention group: This term refers to a group of subjects that receive a specific treatment to test its effect on a disease condition. Here, the intervention group is injected with CYP and subsequently receives perfusion of bladder with P2X3 and NK1 receptors' antagonists, Suramin and GR 82334, which may indicate that CYP and the receptors' antagonists are related to a disease condition.\n- CYP: This abbreviation is not explicitly identified as a disease in the paragraph, but it is used in the context of a disease model. It may refer to a specific compound or substance that is associated with a disease condition.\n\nBased on the analysis, the entities that clearly refer to a disease are:\n\n* CYP (as it is used in the context of a disease model)"},
