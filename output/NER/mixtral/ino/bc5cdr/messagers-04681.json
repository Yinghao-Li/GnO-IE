D-glucaric acid and its salts, known as D-glucarates, are found in various fruits and vegetables and have been studied for their potential to prevent cancer and other diseases.\n2. Nephrotoxicity: While not a chemical itself, nephrotoxicity refers to the degree of kidney damage or dysfunction caused by certain chemicals or drugs. In this context, nephrotoxicity is a chemical effect.\n3. Basic antibiotics: Antibiotics are a class of drugs used to treat bacterial infections. Some antibiotics are basic in nature, meaning they have a pH greater than 7.0. These antibiotics can be toxic to the kidneys, leading to nephrotoxicity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are D - glucarates and basic antibiotics."},
