In this context, it is related to a disease but not a disease itself.\n * Neurotransmitter dysfunction: Similar to metabolic disturbance, it can be a symptom or complication of various diseases. It is not a specific disease.\n * Status epilepticus: According to the World Health Organization, status epilepticus is a \"condition characterized by an epileptic seizure that lasts too long or by recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness between seizures.\" It is considered a disease or medical condition.\n3.

Metabolic disturbance: This is a chemical process that describes an imbalance in the body's metabolic system, which can be caused by various factors such as changes in hormone levels, diet, or illness.\n2.

Dysfunction refers to an abnormality or impairment in the function of these neurotransmitters.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are \"metabolic disturbance\" and \"neurotransmitter dysfunction.\""},
