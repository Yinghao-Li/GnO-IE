PO: This stands for \"per os,\" a Latin term used in medical prescriptions that means \"by mouth.\" It's not a chemical, but it's related to the administration of chemicals (medications).\n3. 60 mg / m (2) body surface area: This is a dosage quantity for CCNU, and while it's not a chemical itself, it's closely related to the administration of the chemical CCNU.\n4. CTX: This is an abbreviation for a chemical compound called Cyclophosphamide, which is an alkylating agent used in chemotherapy.\n5. 250 mg / m (2) divided over days 0 through 4: This is a dosage quantity for CTX, and while it's not a chemical itself, it's closely related to the administration of the chemical CTX.\n6.
