    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Hepatic tissue: While not a chemical itself, hepatic tissue refers to tissue from the liver, which is a biological entity.\n2. Lipid peroxidation products: These are chemicals that form when lipids (fats) in the body react with oxygen, often as a result of oxidative stress. Examples include malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal.\n3. Oxidized glutathione: Also known as glutathione disulfide (GSSG), it is a chemical formed when two glutathione molecules are oxidized.\n4. Reduced glutathione: Also known as glutathione (GSH), it is the reduced form of glutathione, which plays a crucial role in antioxidant defense in the body.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are lipid peroxidation products, oxidized glutathione, and reduced glutathione."},
