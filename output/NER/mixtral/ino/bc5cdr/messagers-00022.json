He went to the doctor and found out that he has rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting many joints, including those in the hands and feet.\"\n\nI can identify the disease entities as \"fatigue\" (which can be a symptom of various diseases), \"joint pain,\" and \"rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\nPlease provide me with a paragraph that contains information about diseases, and I will be happy to help you identify them."},

However, fatigue is not a disease itself, but rather a symptom of various diseases. The other two entities, \"joint pain\" and \"rheumatoid arthritis,\" are more clearly identified as diseases."}
