The paragraph mentions two types of patients: those who cannot tolerate heparin and those who cannot tolerate regional citrate. Heparin is an anticoagulant medication, and citrate is a compound that can be used for anticoagulation. Again, these are not diseases but rather treatments or substances.\n3. The paragraph also mentions \"citrate dialysate,\" which is a solution used in dialysis treatment. Dialysis is a medical procedure, not a disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},

Dialysate: While not a chemical itself, dialysate is a solution used in dialysis to clean the blood of patients with kidney failure. It contains various chemicals, including citrate in this case.\n3. Citric acid: This is another chemical entity. Citric acid is a weak organic tricarboxylic acid that occurs naturally in citrus fruits and other juices.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are citrate, dialysate (which contains various chemicals), and citric acid."},
