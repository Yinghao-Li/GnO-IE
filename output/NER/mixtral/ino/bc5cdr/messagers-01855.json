L-DOPA, or levodopa, is a precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine and is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\n2. benserazide: This is another chemical entity. Benserazide is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that is often used in combination with L-DOPA to prevent the premature conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine outside of the brain.\n3. 12 weeks: While not a chemical entity, it is important to note that this is a duration of treatment rather than a chemical compound.\n4. CB1 KO: This is an abbreviation for \"CB1 knockout,\" which refers to a genetic modification in which the CB1 receptor gene has been removed or \"knocked out.\" It is not a chemical entity.\n5. WT: This is an abbreviation for \"wild type,\" which refers to animals with a normal, unaltered genetic makeup. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are L-DOPA and benserazide."},
