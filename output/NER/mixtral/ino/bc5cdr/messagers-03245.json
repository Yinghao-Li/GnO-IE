Analyzing the context:\n   - Frequent adverse effects: This is a general term that refers to undesirable consequences of a medical treatment or drug. It does not specifically refer to a disease.\n   - Muscle fasciculation: This term refers to the rapid, involuntary contractions and relaxations of muscle fibers. It is often a side effect of certain medical treatments or conditions but is not a disease itself.\n   - Myalgia: This term refers to muscle pain. It can be a symptom of various diseases or conditions but is not a disease itself.\n\n3. List of disease entities:\n   - None of the identified terms are diseases. They are either general terms or symptoms that can be associated with various diseases."},

It is a synthetic compound, and its name is derived from its chemical structure. Succinylcholine is a choline ester of succinic acid. Therefore, it is a chemical.\n\nConclusion: The \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Succinylcholine"},
