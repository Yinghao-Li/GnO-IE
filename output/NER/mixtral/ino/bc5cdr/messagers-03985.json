Octapeptides: This is a general term referring to a chemical compound consisting of eight amino acids.\n3. 3 . 2 mumol / kg: This is a unit of measurement for the dosage of a chemical compound, specifically in this case, the octapeptides.\n4. Diazepam: This is a chemical entity, which is a type of medication used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms, and seizures.\n5. Picrotoxin: This is another chemical entity, which is a convulsant used in scientific research.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are peptide CCK - 5 - 8, octapeptides, diazepam, and picrotoxin."},
