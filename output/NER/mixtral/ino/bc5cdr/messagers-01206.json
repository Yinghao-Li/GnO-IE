It's not a chemical entity, but rather a physiological condition.\n2. Nomega - nitro - L - arginine (LNNA): This is a chemical entity, specifically a drug also known as L-NNA or NG-nitro-L-arginine. It is an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme that produces nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Nomega - nitro - L - arginine (LNNA)."},
