Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph, the words \"DES-induced pituitary growth\" and \"hemorrhagic phenotype\" are potential disease-related phrases.\n\n1. DES-induced pituitary growth: This phrase refers to a condition where pituitary growth is caused by exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic form of estrogen. Although not a \"disease\" in the traditional sense, it is a medical condition with negative health consequences.\n2. Hemorrhagic phenotype: A phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an organism resulting from the interaction of its genotype and the environment. In this context, a \"hemorrhagic phenotype\" likely refers to a condition where an individual has an increased tendency to bleed or experience hemorrhages. This can be associated with various diseases, such as hemophilia or von Willebrand disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* DES-induced pituitary growth\n* Hemorrhagic phenotype (which can be a symptom of various diseases)"},
