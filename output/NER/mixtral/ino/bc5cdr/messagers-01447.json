    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Dilated cardiomyopathy: This is a heart muscle disease where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, affecting its ability to pump blood efficiently. It is not a chemical, but a medical condition.\n2. Functional mitral regurgitation (MR): Mitral regurgitation is a condition where the mitral valve in the heart does not close properly, causing blood to leak back into the left atrium. \"Functional\" refers to the type of MR that occurs due to changes in the size and shape of the heart chambers, rather than a problem with the mitral valve itself. It is not a chemical.\n3. Undersized mitral annuloplasty (MAP): Mitral annuloplasty is a surgical procedure to repair or replace the mitral valve in the heart. \"Undersized\" refers to a specific technique where the mitral annulus (the ring-like structure surrounding the mitral valve) is made smaller to improve its function. It is not a chemical.\n4. Left ventricular (LV): The left ventricle is one of the four chambers of the heart, responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. It is not a chemical.\n\nTherefore, there are no chemical entities in the given paragraph."},
