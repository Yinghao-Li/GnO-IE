An increase in creatine phosphokinase levels can indicate damage to these tissues, but it is not a disease itself.\n2. drug-induced myopathy: Myopathy refers to a group of muscle diseases characterized by muscle weakness and other symptoms. \"Drug-induced\" indicates that the myopathy is a side effect of a medication. Therefore, \"drug-induced myopathy\" represents a disease.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* drug-induced myopathy"},

It is often measured in blood tests as a marker for muscle damage.\n2. The upper limit of normal: This is a range of values that is considered to be within the normal range for a particular laboratory test. In this case, the upper limit of normal for creatine phosphokinase is being used as a reference point to determine whether a patient has an abnormally high level of this enzyme in their blood.\n3. Drug: While not explicitly named, the paragraph refers to the observation of \"no cases of drug-induced myopathy,\" implying that a drug is being discussed. Drugs are chemical substances that are used to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are creatine phosphokinase, the upper limit of normal, and the implied drug."},
