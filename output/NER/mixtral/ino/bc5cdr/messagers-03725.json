Thalamus: This is a region of the brain that can be affected by various neurological conditions.\n3. Amygdala: This is an almond-shaped group of nuclei located deep within the temporal lobes of the brain and is known to play a role in emotions, memory, and decision-making. It can be affected by several diseases, including epilepsy.\n4. Olfactory cortex: This is the part of the brain that is responsible for the sense of smell and can be affected by various neurological conditions.\n5. Substantia nigra: This is a region of the midbrain that plays a crucial role in reward, addiction, and movement regulation. It is affected in Parkinson's disease.\n6. Neocortex: This is the outermost layer of the brain, responsible for higher-order brain functions such as sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, and language. It can be affected by various neurological conditions, including epilepsy.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Epilepsy (implied by the mention of seizure-related damage)\n* Parkinson's disease (specifically mentioned as affecting the substantia nigra)"},
