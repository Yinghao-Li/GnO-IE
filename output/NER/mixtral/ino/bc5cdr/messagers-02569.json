Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn this paragraph, the potential disease-related words or phrases are:\n\na. chronic complications\nb. levodopa therapy\n\nNow let's analyze the context:\n\na. chronic complications - This term is used in the context of a health condition or disease, as it refers to problems that arise over time due to a particular treatment (in this case, levodopa therapy). Therefore, \"chronic complications\" can be considered a disease entity.\n\nb. levodopa therapy - While this is not a disease itself, it is a treatment for a disease. Specifically, levodopa therapy is a treatment for Parkinson's disease. Since the paragraph is about chronic complications of this therapy, it is essential to understanding the context of the study. However, it is not a disease entity.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Chronic complications (of levodopa therapy)"},
