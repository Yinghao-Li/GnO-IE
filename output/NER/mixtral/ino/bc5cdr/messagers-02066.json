It is a protein that is found on the surface of certain immune cells and plays a role in the immune response.\n2. CCL2: It is another chemical entity that stands for C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). It is a chemokine, which is a type of signaling molecule that attracts immune cells to a site of inflammation or injury.\n\nBoth CCR2 and CCL2 are involved in the inflammatory response in the brain, and their up-regulation in the hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) suggests that they may play a role in the development of seizures and epilepsy."},
