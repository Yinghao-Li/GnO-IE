It is a disease recognized by the medical community, specifically a substance use disorder.\n* Psychotic symptoms: These are signs of psychosis, which is a severe mental disorder characterized by a detachment from reality, often including delusional beliefs and hallucinations. Psychosis can be a symptom of various mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder.\n\nBased on the context, both \"methamphetamine dependence\" and \"psychotic symptoms\" are disease entities. Methamphetamine dependence is a substance use disorder, while psychotic symptoms can indicate various mental health disorders."},
