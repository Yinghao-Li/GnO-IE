Levodopa - This is a chemical medication, also known as L-DOPA, used to treat Parkinson's disease. It is a precursor to dopamine, which helps to replace the missing neurotransmitter in the brain.\n4.

It is characterized by involuntary movements and is caused by an imbalance in the levels of dopamine in the brain.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Parkinson's disease (PD), levodopa, and dyskinesias (LIDs)."},
