Anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells or a lower than normal level of hemoglobin in the blood.\n4. The anemia in this case is attributed to bone marrow suppression.\n5. Bone marrow suppression is a condition where the bone marrow is not producing enough new cells to replenish the blood cells.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Anemia\n* Bone marrow suppression"},

Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive drug, used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs and to treat autoimmune diseases.\n2. Anemia: While anemia is not a chemical, it is a condition that can be caused by a chemical imbalance in the body. Specifically, anemia can be caused by a lack of sufficient healthy red blood cells or insufficient hemoglobin in the blood, which can be due to various chemical deficiencies or disorders.\n3. Bone marrow suppression: This is another condition that can be caused by chemicals. Bone marrow suppression refers to the decreased production of blood cells in the bone marrow, which can be caused by various chemical agents, including chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, and certain medications like azathioprine.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are azathioprine, anemia (indirectly), and bone marrow suppression (indirectly)."},
