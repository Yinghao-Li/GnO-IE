Some people have turned to alternative disinfectants, such as bleach, to make their own hand sanitizers, but this can be dangerous. Bleach, or sodium hypochlorite, should not be used as a substitute for isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, as it can cause skin irritation and is not safe for use on the skin.\n\nChemical entities:\n\n* isopropyl alcohol\n* ethanol\n* bleach (sodium hypochlorite)"},
