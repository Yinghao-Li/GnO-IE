Verify if they are indeed chemical entities:\n- Normal saline: It is a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water, which is used as a normalizing agent in various medical applications. Since it is a solution of a specific chemical compound, it is considered a chemical entity.\n- BCNU solvent: BCNU (Carmustine) is a chemotherapeutic agent, and it requires a solvent for administration. The solvent itself is a chemical entity, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the text what the solvent is. Nonetheless, since it is a solvent for a chemotherapeutic agent, it can be inferred that it is a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n1. Normal saline\n2. BCNU solvent"},
