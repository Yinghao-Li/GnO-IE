This kind of damage is not a disease itself, but it can be a result of various neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\nNone explicitly mentioned, but the context implies potential neurological disorders leading to the observed \"neuronal and glial damage\" in the SNR."},
