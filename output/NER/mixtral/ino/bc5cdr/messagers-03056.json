It is a potential complication during pregnancy and can be caused by various factors, including certain diseases or conditions.\n2. Teratogenicity: This term refers to the ability of a substance or agent to cause birth defects or abnormalities in a developing fetus. Teratogens can include certain medications, chemicals, infections, and illnesses.\n3. Growth retardation: This term refers to a condition in which a fetus or infant fails to grow at a normal rate. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic disorders, maternal health problems, and environmental factors.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the potential diseases or conditions that can cause embryolethality and growth retardation, as well as the diseases or conditions that can lead to the development of teratogens."},
