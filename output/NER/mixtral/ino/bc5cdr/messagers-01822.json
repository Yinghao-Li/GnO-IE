It is a white crystalline powder with a faint acetous odor and a sour taste. Aspirin is a salicylate drug, often used as an analgesic to relieve minor aches and pains, as an antipyretic to reduce fever, and as an anti-inflammatory medication.\n* Myocardial infarction: It is a medical condition, not a chemical. It is the damage or death of part of the heart muscle (myocardium) due to the interruption of its blood supply, typically due to a coronary artery becoming blocked by a blood clot.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"Aspirin.\""},
