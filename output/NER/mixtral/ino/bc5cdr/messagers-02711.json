Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn this paragraph, there are no direct mentions of diseases. However, the text discusses the effect of a treatment (STZ) on the expression of certain proteins in the brain, suggesting a possible neurological context.\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"selective post synaptic neurotoxicity.\" Neurotoxicity refers to damage to the nervous system, which can be caused by various factors, including diseases, toxins, or medications. In this context, neurotoxicity is described as being \"selective post synaptic,\" implying that the damage is specific to the post-synaptic region of the neuron.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Selective post synaptic neurotoxicity (indirectly mentioned)"},

PSD-95: This stands for Postsynaptic density protein 95, which is a scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in the organization and function of the postsynaptic density in excitatory synapses.\n4. Synaptophysin: This is a protein found in the presynaptic vesicles of neurons and is often used as a marker for presynaptic terminals.\n5. SNAP-25: This stands for Synaptosomal-associated protein 25, which is a protein involved in the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane during neurotransmitter release.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are Streptozotocin (STZ), CaMKIIa, PSD-95, Synaptophysin, and SNAP-25."},
