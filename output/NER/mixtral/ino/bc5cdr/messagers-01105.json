VCM (Vancomycin): This is an antibiotic used to treat severe infections caused by bacteria.\n3. MDA (Malondialdehyde): This is a type of compound called an aldehyde, which is produced during lipid peroxidation. It is a marker of oxidative stress.\n4. NAG (N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase): This is an enzyme found in many tissues, including the kidney. Its presence in urine is a marker of kidney damage.\n5. SOD (Superoxide dismutase): This is an enzyme that helps break down potentially harmful oxygen molecules in cells, which can prevent damage to tissues and DNA.\n6. CAT (Catalase): This is an enzyme that helps protect the body's cells from the damaging effects of free radicals.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are Erdosteine, VCM, MDA, NAG, SOD, and CAT."},
