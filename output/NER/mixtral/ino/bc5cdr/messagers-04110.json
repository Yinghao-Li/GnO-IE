Life-support medium: This is a mixture of chemicals that is used to maintain the viability of isolated sino-atrial tissue from a rabbit heart during in vitro perfusion.\n3. Isolated sino-atrial tissue: This refers to the natural tissue from a rabbit heart that has been removed from the animal and is being studied in a laboratory setting.\n4. Rabbit heart: This is a chemical entity in the sense that it is a biological organ composed of various chemicals.\n5. KCl microelectrodes: Potassium chloride (KCl) is a chemical compound that is used to make microelectrodes, which are used to record action potentials in the sino-atrial tissue.\n6. Action potential (AP): This is a change in electrical potential across a membrane, which is a chemical phenomenon.\n7. Doses: This refers to the measured quantities of bepridil that were used in the study.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are: bepridil, life-support medium, isolated sino-atrial tissue, rabbit heart, KCl microelectrodes, action potential (AP), and doses."},
