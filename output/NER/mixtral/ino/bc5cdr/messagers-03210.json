Cyclosporine: This is also an immunosuppressive drug that is often used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs.\n3. Nephropathy: This is a general term for any disease or damage that affects the kidneys.\n4. Serum: This is the clear yellowish fluid that is left over when blood clots. It contains various substances, such as proteins and electrolytes, that are circulating in the blood.\n5. Urine: This is the liquid waste that is produced by the kidneys and excreted through the urinary tract.\n6. Gene: This is a segment of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein.\n7. Protein: This is a large molecule that is made up of one or more chains of amino acids. Proteins are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's cells, tissues, and organs.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are sirolimus, cyclosporine, and the various substances mentioned in the context of serum and urine (proteins and electrolytes). It's worth noting that the term \"chemical\" can be used broadly to refer to any substance or compound, whether it is naturally occurring or synthetic. In this sense, all of the entities listed above could be considered \"chemicals.\" However, in the context of this paragraph, the focus is on drugs and substances that are involved in the process of nephropathy and its treatment, rather than on the chemical properties of these substances."},
