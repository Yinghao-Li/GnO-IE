(This is an abbreviation for intravenous, which refers to a route of administration, not a chemical entity.)\n\nStep 2:\nLet's research each potential chemical entity:\n\n* Trimethaphan: Trimethaphan is a ganglionic blocker, a type of drug that inhibits the transmission of nerve impulses by blocking the action of acetylcholine at the ganglionic synapse. It is used to treat hypertensive emergencies.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Trimethaphan."},
