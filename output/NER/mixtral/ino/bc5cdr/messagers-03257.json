In this context, it is not being used as a disease entity.\n* Reducing urea transporter (UT-A1) expression: UT-A1 is a type of urea transporter, and changes in its expression can be associated with certain medical conditions, but it is not a disease entity.\n* Reducing water channel (AQP2) expression: AQP2 is a type of water channel, and changes in its expression can be associated with certain medical conditions, such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, but it is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, there are no clear disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
