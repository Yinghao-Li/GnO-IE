Analyze the context to ensure that the identified words or phrases indeed refer to diseases.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two diseases mentioned:\n\n1. Amphetamine hyperactivity: This is a condition where an individual experiences excessive activity or restlessness due to the use of amphetamines.\n2. The neurotoxic action of DSP4: DSP4 (N-3-[2,4-dichlorophenyl]-N-1,2-diphenylethyl-propan-1-amine) is a neurotoxin that destroys noradrenergic neurons in the central nervous system. Its neurotoxic action can lead to various neurological disorders and diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Amphetamine hyperactivity and the neurotoxic action of DSP4."},
