VTE is a well-known disease and the context in the paragraph clearly indicates that it is being used as a medical condition.\n\n* Oral contraceptives (OCs): Although not a disease itself, OCs are a medication used to prevent pregnancy. However, the paragraph mentions that the incidence of VTE is higher in women who used OCs containing certain types of progestagens. Therefore, OCs are relevant to the discussion of the disease VTE.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Venous thromboembolism (VTE)"},
