Dopamine is a type of chemical called a neurotransmitter, which transmits signals in the brain and other areas of the body. A \"dopaminergic blockade\" refers to the prevention or inhibition of dopamine's action at its receptors, which can occur due to certain medications or other factors.\n\nTherefore, \"dopaminergic\" is the chemical entity in this context, as it relates to the neurotransmitter dopamine and its role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome mentioned in the paragraph."},
