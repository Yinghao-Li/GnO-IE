Analyze the context to ensure that the identified words or phrases are indeed being used as diseases.\n\nIn this paragraph, the potential medical conditions or diseases are:\n\n* NO deficiency\n* oxidative stress\n* hypertension\n\nNow, let's analyze the context:\n\n* NO deficiency: It's not a disease itself but rather a condition or state of insufficient Nitric Oxide (NO) in the body.\n* oxidative stress: While not a disease itself, it is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and the body's ability to detoxify or repair the resulting damage. It can contribute to the development of various diseases, but it is not a disease itself.\n* hypertension: This is a well-known disease, specifically a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.\n\nTherefore, the only \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* hypertension"},
