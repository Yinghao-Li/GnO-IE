Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n   - homonymous hemianopsia\n   - became transiently confused\n\n2. Analyzing the context:\n   - homonymous hemianopsia: This is a medical condition characterized by the loss of half of the visual field in one or both eyes. It is often caused by damage to the optic nerve or brain. In this context, it is mentioned as a complication following treatment in the Gamma Knife group.\n   - became transiently confused: Confusion is a state of being unaware of one's surroundings, and transient means it is temporary. In this context, it is mentioned as a postoperative complication in the radiofrequency group.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Homonymous hemianopsia\n2. Confusion (specifically, transient confusion)"},
