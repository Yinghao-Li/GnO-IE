Jaundice is a condition characterized by the yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes due to an accumulation of bilirubin.

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the 27-year-old man developed jaundice after exposure to thiabendazole.\n5. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n   - Jaundice\n\nNote: Thiabendazole is not a disease, but a medication. The paragraph suggests that the man developed jaundice after exposure to thiabendazole, but it does not necessarily mean that thiabendazole caused the jaundice.
