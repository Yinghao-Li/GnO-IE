Analyze each potential chemical entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text are:\n\n* Olanzapine\n* Risperidone\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each potential chemical entity:\n\n* Olanzapine: It is an atypical antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autism. It is a well-known chemical compound with the molecular formula C17H20F3N4O. Therefore, Olanzapine is a chemical entity.\n* Risperidone: It is another atypical antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autism. Risperidone is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C17H19F6N3O2. Therefore, Risperidone is also a chemical entity.\n\nConclusion: The chemical entities in the paragraph are Olanzapine and Risperidone."},
