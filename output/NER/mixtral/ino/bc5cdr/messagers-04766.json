Supratentorial brain: While not a disease, it is a medical term referring to the upper part of the brain, so we will not include it in our list of diseases.\n2. Basal ganglia: This is a group of structures within the brain that play a crucial role in regulating voluntary motor control, cognition, and emotion. It is not considered a disease.\n3. Striatum: This is a part of the basal ganglia and is not a disease.\n4. Multicystic encephalomalacia: This is a medical term for a condition characterized by multiple cystic lesions in the brain due to softening of the brain tissue, often caused by hypoxia or ischemia. It is a disease or medical condition.\n5. Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: This is a medical term for a condition that occurs when a newborn experiences a lack of oxygen and blood flow to the brain around the time of birth. It is a disease or medical condition.\n6. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: This is a rare but potentially life-threatening neurological disorder that can occur in people who are taking antipsychotic medications. It is a disease or medical condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are multicystic encephalomalacia, perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome."},
