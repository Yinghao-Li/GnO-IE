Analyze the context for implicit disease references: The paragraph mentions \"previously untreated patients\" and \"objective responses\" to a therapy.

Determine the implicit \"Disease\" entities: Since the patients are being treated for a specific condition, it can be inferred that the disease or condition is what the therapy is targeting.
