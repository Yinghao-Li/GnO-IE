ANCA is a type of autoantibody (a type of antibody produced by the immune system that mistakenly attacks the body's own cells and tissues) that is directed against proteins in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.\n2. antithyroidmedications - This is also a chemical entity. Antithyroid medications are drugs that are used to treat hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. Examples of antithyroid medications include propylthiouracil and methimazole.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\" and \"antithyroid medications.\""},
