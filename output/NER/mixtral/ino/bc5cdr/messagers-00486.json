Determine if they refer to a specific disease or a general condition.\n\nIn the paragraph, the potential disease-related words/phrases are:\n\n* Angiography\n* cTnI - positive\n* significant disease\n\nNow, let's analyze the context:\n\n* Angiography is a medical test used to visualize the inside of blood vessels and organs. It doesn't refer to a disease itself.\n* cTnI (cardiac troponin I) is a protein released into the bloodstream during a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Being cTnI-positive indicates that a patient has had a heart attack.\n* \"Significant disease\" is mentioned in the context of being present in 86% of the patients who were cTnI-positive. Given the previous point, it's clear that the \"significant disease\" refers to the heart condition causing the heart attack.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Heart attack (myocardial infarction) - implied as the cause of cTnI-positivity\n2. The general term \"disease\" - specifically the heart condition causing the heart attack"},
