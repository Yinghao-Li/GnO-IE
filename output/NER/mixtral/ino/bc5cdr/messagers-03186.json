It refers to not following established guidelines or procedures.\n* A higher occurrence - This is a general term and does not specifically refer to a disease.\n* AKI - Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a disease. It is a condition characterized by a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or a few days.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the given paragraph is \"AKI\" (Acute Kidney Injury)."},

However, there are some medical/scientific terms related to the field of medicine and pharmacology. Here's a breakdown of those terms:\n\n1. SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) - These are not chemical entities but rather established procedures or guidelines followed in various fields, including healthcare.\n2. Nephrotoxic antibiotics - Antibiotics are a class of medications used to treat infections, while nephrotoxic refers to substances that can cause kidney damage. So, nephrotoxic antibiotics are antibiotics that can potentially harm the kidneys.\n3. AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) - A medical condition characterized by sudden kidney failure or damage.\n\nWhile these terms are related to the field of medicine and pharmacology, they are not chemical entities in the traditional sense."},
