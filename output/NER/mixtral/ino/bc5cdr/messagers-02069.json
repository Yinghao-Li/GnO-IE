Caspase - 3 activity: While caspase-3 is a protein involved in programmed cell death (apoptosis), describing its activity is not referring to a disease.\n3. TNFalpha levels: TNFalpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha) is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation, but simply mentioning its levels is not referring to a disease.\n4. Carmustine: Carmustine is a chemotherapy drug used to treat brain tumors and other cancers, but it is not a disease itself.\n5. Cognitive function: This term refers to the ability to think, understand, learn, and remember. It is not a disease.\n6. Intact hippocampal neurons: The hippocampus is a part of the brain involved in learning and memory, and neurons are its primary cells. Describing them as intact does not refer to any disease.\n\nIn summary, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},
