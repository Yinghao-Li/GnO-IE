It is used to specify the source of the substance being measured.\n3. sFas (soluble Fas): This is the first chemical entity identified in the paragraph. sFas is a protein that is involved in programmed cell death or apoptosis.\n4. ELISA: This is an abbreviation for Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, which is a biochemical technique used to detect the presence of a substance (like sFas) in a sample. Therefore, ELISA is not a chemical entity.\n5. 24 patients with acute liver failure: While patients and liver failure are medical terms, they do not refer to chemical entities.\n6. 10 normal control subjects: Similar to the previous point, this refers to a group of individuals and not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity identified in the paragraph is sFas (soluble Fas)."},
