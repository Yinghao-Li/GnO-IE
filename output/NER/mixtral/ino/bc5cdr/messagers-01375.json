A disease is a condition or disorder that affects the body or a specific part of the body.\n2. The paragraph mentions \"the appearance of a lichenoid dermatitis.\"\n3. Dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin, and \"lichenoid\" describes a skin eruption that resembles lichen.\n4. Therefore, \"lichenoid dermatitis\" refers to a specific type of skin inflammation that resembles lichen, which is a disease entity.\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as penicillamine and zinc acetate, are medications used to treat the disease, but they are not diseases themselves."},
