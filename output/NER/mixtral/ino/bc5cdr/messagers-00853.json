Lipid peroxidation is a process in which free radicals \"steal\" electrons from the lipids in cell membranes, resulting in cell damage. While not a disease itself, increased levels of lipid peroxides can indicate oxidative stress, which can be associated with various diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n4.
