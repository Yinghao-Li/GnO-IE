Therefore, I cannot definitively identify \"RD\" as a disease entity.\n2. RRMM: Based on the abbreviation and the context of the paragraph, RRMM likely stands for \"Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma,\" which is a type of cancer. Therefore, RRMM can be identified as a disease entity.\n3. Stable disease: This is a term used in medical contexts to describe a state where a patient's disease is neither worsening nor improving. While it does not refer to a specific disease, it does imply the presence of an underlying disease or condition. Therefore, \"stable disease\" can be identified as a disease entity in this context."},
