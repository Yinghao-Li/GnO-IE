Analyze each term to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nSubacute effects: This term refers to the time frame of the study and does not represent a disease.\n\npropranolol: Propranolol is a medication used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, angina, irregular heartbeats, and certain types of tremors. However, it is not a disease itself.\n\nB 24 / 76: This term is unclear and may be a typo or a specific identifier for a compound. It does not appear to represent a disease.\n\nisoproterenol: Isoproterenol is a medication used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate) and heart block. It is not a disease itself.\n\nrat heart hypertrophy: Heart hypertrophy refers to the enlargement of the heart muscle, which can be a symptom of various heart diseases such as hypertension, cardiomyopathy, or valvular heart disease. However, in this context, it is a study subject and not a specific disease.\n\nblood pressure: Blood pressure is a measurement of the force applied to the walls of the arteries as blood flows through them. High or low blood pressure can be a symptom of various diseases, but in this context, it is a study parameter and not a specific disease.\n\nIn summary, there are no clear \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},

It is a beta blocker medication used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, angina, and other heart conditions.\n2. B 24 / 76: This is also a chemical entity, but I am unable to identify it further as there is limited information provided about it. It could be a specific compound or a combination of compounds being studied in the experiment.\n3. Isoproterenol: This is another chemical entity. It is a medication used as a decongestant and a vasodilator. It is also used as a positive inotrope in the treatment of bradycardia and heart block.\n4. Rat heart hypertrophy: While not a chemical entity, it is important to note that this is a condition being studied in the experiment.\n5. Blood pressure: This is a physiological measurement, not a chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are propranolol, B 24 / 76, and isoproterenol."},
