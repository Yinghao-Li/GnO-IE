Segmental glomerulosclerosis is a kidney disease that involves scarring of the glomeruli, which can lead to kidney failure.\n3. Tubulointerstitial injury is a general term that refers to damage to the tubules and interstitial tissue in the kidney, which can be caused by various diseases or injuries.\n4. Renal cortical malondialdehyde content is a measure of oxidative stress in the kidney, which can be associated with various kidney diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Glomerular hypertrophy\n* Segmental glomerulosclerosis\n* Tubulointerstitial injury\n* Renal cortical malondialdehyde content (although this is not a disease itself, it is a marker of oxidative stress that can be associated with kidney disease)"},
