Renal damage: Although not explicitly stated, this is also a \"Disease\" entity, as it refers to damage to the kidneys, which can lead to various complications such as albuminuria.\n3. Cardiomyopathy: This is a \"Disease\" entity, as it refers to a condition that affects the heart muscle, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood effectively.\n4. Ascites: While not a disease itself, ascites can be a symptom or complication of various medical conditions, such as liver disease or renal disease. In this context, ascites is mentioned as a possible consequence of low serum albumin levels due to renal damage.\n5. Hydrothorax: Similar to ascites, hydrothorax is not a disease but a symptom or complication of various medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease. In this context, hydrothorax is mentioned as a possible consequence of low serum albumin levels due to renal damage.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are albuminuria, renal damage, and cardiomyopathy."},
