Hyperglycaemia refers to a condition characterized by an abnormally high level of glucose in the blood.\n2. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: This is the second disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a condition characterized by an excessive production of dilute urine due to the inability of the kidneys to respond to antidiuretic hormone (ADH).\n3. Lithium-induced: Although not a disease per se, lithium-induced is a modifier that indicates the cause of the nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in this case. Lithium is a medication commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, but it can have side effects, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus."},

Glucose is a simple sugar or monosaccharide that serves as a fundamental energy source in living organisms.\n\n2. Blood glucose concentrations: Here, glucose is mentioned again as it is being compared to normal concentrations.\n\n3. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: This is a condition where the kidneys cannot respond to the antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urine production. Although not explicitly mentioned, the \"diabetes\" here is related to the excessive urine production (polyuria) and not to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).\n\n4. Lithium: This is a chemical element (atomic number 3 on the periodic table) and is also a medication used to treat certain mental health disorders. In this context, it is mentioned as a potential cause of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are glucose, lithium, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (though not a chemical itself, it is a condition related to the kidneys' response to antidiuretic hormone, which is a chemical)."},
