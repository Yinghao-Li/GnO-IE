It is a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that play a role in pain and inflammation.\n2. PGE2: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a type of prostaglandin, a group of lipid compounds that are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including the regulation of inflammation and pain. PGE2 is synthesized from arachidonic acid by the action of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).\n\nThese are the two chemical entities that I can identify in the given paragraph."},
