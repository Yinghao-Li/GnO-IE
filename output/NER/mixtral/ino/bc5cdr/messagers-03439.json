Research or examine the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nApplying these steps to the paragraph:\n\n1. The potential disease-related words or phrases in the paragraph are:\n - \"Estrogen binding sites\"\n - \"renal carcinomas\"\n - \"diethylstilbesterol induced\"\n2. Analyzing the context:\n - \"Estrogen binding sites\" does not refer to a disease, but a specific cellular feature.\n - \"Renal carcinomas\" are a type of cancer that affects the kidneys, which is a disease.\n - \"Diethylstilbesterol induced\" refers to a chemical that can cause a disease (renal carcinomas in this case), but it is not a disease itself.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Renal carcinomas"},
