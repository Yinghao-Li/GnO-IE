Progestin is a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone, which is a type of \"Steroid hormone.\" However, in this context, \"third-generation\" is more of a categorization or grouping of a certain type of oral contraceptive, rather than a specific chemical entity.\n2. Second-generation: Similar to third-generation, this term refers to another classification of oral contraceptives based on the type of progestin they contain. Again, it's more of a categorization or grouping of a certain type of oral contraceptive, rather than a specific chemical entity.\n3. Oral Contraceptives (OCs): These are medications that contain hormones to prevent pregnancy. Most oral contraceptives are a combination of an estrogen and a progestin. As mentioned earlier, progestin is a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone, which is a type of \"Steroid hormone.\" Estrogen is a type of \"Steroid hormone\" as well.\n\nTo summarize, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Progestin (a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone, which is a steroid hormone)\n2. Estrogen (a type of steroid hormone)\n\nThe other terms, such as third-generation and second-generation, are categorizations or groupings of certain types of oral contraceptives based on the type of progestin they contain."},
