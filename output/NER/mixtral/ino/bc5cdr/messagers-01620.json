It is not a chemical itself but a protein.\n2. -IR - Immunoreactive (IR) refers to the presence of an antigen or antibody that can be detected by an immunological test. It is not a chemical entity.\n3. CYP - CYP is an abbreviation for cytochrome P450, which is a group of enzymes involved in drug metabolism. It is a chemical entity.\n4. Cystitis - Cystitis is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the bladder. It is not a chemical entity.\n5. Acute, intermediate, and chronic - These are descriptors for the severity or duration of CYP-induced cystitis, not chemical entities.\n\nSo, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"CYP\", which stands for cytochrome P450."},
