Local anesthetics are a class of drugs that cause reversible loss of sensation in a specific part of the body, by blocking nerve impulses in that area.\n2. \"nociceptive input\" - While not a chemical, \"nociceptive\" refers to the activation of nerve cells that detect and transmit painful stimuli. So, \"nociceptive input\" can be considered to be related to the effects of chemicals (neurotransmitters) that transmit pain signals.\n3. \"inflammation\" - This is a biological process, not a chemical entity. However, it is important to note that inflammation is modulated by various chemical mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, and eicosanoids.\n\nTherefore, the only clear chemical entity in the paragraph is \"local anesthetics\"."},
