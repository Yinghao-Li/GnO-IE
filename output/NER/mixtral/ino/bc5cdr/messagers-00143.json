Acute nephrotoxicity: This is a condition where the kidneys become damaged or fail to function properly due to exposure to certain toxins, including certain medications like sulfonamides (to which sulfadiazine belongs).\n3. Toxoplasmosis: This is a parasitic infection that can affect humans and animals, and is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. It is often asymptomatic in healthy individuals but can cause serious complications in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS.\n4. HIV: This stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes HIV infection and AIDS. It weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to other infections and diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Sulfadiazine acute nephrotoxicity\n* Toxoplasmosis\n* HIV/AIDS (although this is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, it is implied as a condition that can make people more susceptible to toxoplasmosis and its complications)"},
