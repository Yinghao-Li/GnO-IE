List out the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph.\n\nFollowing the steps above, let's analyze the paragraph:\n\n1. Potential medical terms in the paragraph:\n - Dilatation of tubular lumens\n - Epithelial cell vacuolization\n - Atrophy\n - Desquamation\n - Necrosis\n\n2. Research and analyze each term:\n - Dilatation of tubular lumens: While not a disease itself, dilatation refers to the abnormal enlargement or distension of a tubular structure, which can be a symptom of various diseases.\n - Epithelial cell vacuolization: This is not a disease itself but a cellular change that can be observed in various conditions, including certain diseases.\n - Atrophy: Atrophy is the progressive wasting or decrease in the size of a cell, tissue, organ, or entire body due to disease, injury, or lack of use.\n - Desquamation: Desquamation is the shedding of the outer layers of the skin, which can be a symptom of various skin conditions and diseases.\n - Necrosis: Necrosis is the premature death of cells and living tissue caused by external factors such as infection, trauma, or toxins.\n\n3. List out the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph:\n - Atrophy\n - (Potential skin) diseases leading to Desquamation\n - Diseases causing Necrosis\n\nKeep in mind that the paragraph does not explicitly mention specific diseases but rather discusses pathological changes that can be associated with various medical conditions."},
