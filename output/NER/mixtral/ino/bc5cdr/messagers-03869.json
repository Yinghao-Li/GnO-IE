However, recurrent seizures can be a condition known as epilepsy. In this context, seizures are the main focus, but they are not the disease.\n* Newborn infants are a demographic, not a disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the provided paragraph."},

However, I can rephrase the information to include a disease for better clarity:\n\nParagraph: Morphine - induced seizures in newborn infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).\n\nIn this revised paragraph, \"neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS)\" is the disease entity. It is a condition in newborn infants who were exposed to opioids, like morphine, while in the womb. When the infants are born and are no longer exposed to the opioids, they can experience withdrawal symptoms, one of which is seizures."},
