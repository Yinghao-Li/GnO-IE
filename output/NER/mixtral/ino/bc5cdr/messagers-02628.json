However, I can identify some potential chemical or medical terms that could be considered entities:\n\n1. Contrast: In medical imaging, contrast agents are often used to improve the visibility of internal body structures. Contrast agents can be chemical substances that are injected or ingested by the patient before the imaging procedure.\n2. Nephropathy: This is a medical term that refers to kidney disease or damage. While not a chemical itself, it is a condition that can be caused or exacerbated by certain chemicals or drugs.\n3. Cancer: This is a general term for a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. While not a chemical entity, cancer can be caused or influenced by various chemical or environmental factors.\n\nTherefore, the potential chemical entities in the paragraph could be \"contrast agents\" used in medical imaging, although the specific chemicals are not mentioned in the text."},
