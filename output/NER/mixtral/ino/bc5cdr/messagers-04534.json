E - I, S - I, and EC: These are most likely abbreviations for experimental groups or conditions, but without further context, I cannot determine if they represent any specific chemicals.\n4. Isoproterenol: This is a medication used as a bronchodilator and a positive chronotrope. It is a synthetic catecholamine, a type of drug that mimics the effects of adrenaline.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are serum, CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), and isoproterenol."},
