Cocaine use: The context of the study is to evaluate the safety of lidocaine in the setting of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. Cocaine is a powerful addictive stimulant that affects the brain and central nervous system. Its use can lead to various health issues, including cardiovascular problems.\n2. Myocardial infarction (MI): Also known as a heart attack, myocardial infarction is a serious medical condition that occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, often by a blood clot. This can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle. In this case, the MI is induced by cocaine use."},

Cocaine: While cocaine is a substance, its use can lead to various health issues, including cardiovascular problems. In this context, cocaine is directly related to the disease condition, which is cocaine-induced myocardial infarction.\n2. Myocardial infarction (MI): This is a clear disease entity, referring to a heart attack caused by blocked blood flow to a part of the heart.\n\nSince the main focus of the study is to evaluate the safety of lidocaine in the setting of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction, both cocaine and myocardial infarction are relevant and related to the disease context."},
