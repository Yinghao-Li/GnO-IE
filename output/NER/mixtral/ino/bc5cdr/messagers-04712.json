In the given paragraph, the potential \"Disease\" entities are:\n * \"intracoronary infusion of cocaine\" - While cocaine itself is not a disease, its use can lead to various health issues, including cardiovascular problems.\n * \"left ventricular systolic and diastolic function\" - These are medical conditions related to the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently. Systolic dysfunction refers to the inability of the left ventricle to eject blood properly during contraction, while diastolic dysfunction refers to the impaired ability of the left ventricle to fill with blood during relaxation.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cocaine use and its potential cardiovascular effects\n2. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction\n3. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction"},

In this case, the substance being injected is cocaine.\n3.
