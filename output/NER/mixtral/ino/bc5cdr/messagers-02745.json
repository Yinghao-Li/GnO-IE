However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if TNA is a chemical entity in this paragraph. A quick search for \"TNA\" in the context of medical abbreviations reveals that it could stand for \"Tuberculin Neutralizing Antibody,\" which is not a chemical compound. Therefore, it is unlikely that TNA is a chemical entity in this paragraph.\n\nConclusion: Based on the given paragraph, there are no clear chemical entities present."},
