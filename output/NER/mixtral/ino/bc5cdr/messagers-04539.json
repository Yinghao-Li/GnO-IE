Placebo: A placebo is a substance or treatment that has no therapeutic effect. It is often used in clinical trials as a control against which the effects of a new drug or treatment are compared. Placebos can be chemical substances, such as sugar pills, or they can be non-chemical, such as sham procedures.\n3. Single-blind study: In a single-blind study, the participants do not know whether they are receiving the experimental treatment or a placebo. This type of study design helps to reduce bias in the results.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"peptides\" and \"placebo.\""},
