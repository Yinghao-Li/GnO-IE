Analyze each potential chemical entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: The potential chemical entities in the text are \"cortisol\" and \"day.\"\n\nStep 2:\na. Cortisol: Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland in response to stress. It is a type of steroid hormone, which is a class of organic compounds. Therefore, cortisol is a chemical.\nb. Day: A day is a unit of time, and it does not fit the definition of a chemical, which is a substance with a distinct molecular composition that determines its properties.\n\nConclusion: The chemical entity in the paragraph is \"cortisol.\""},
