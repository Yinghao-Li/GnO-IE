So, I will not count it as a chemical entity.\n2. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): This is a chemical compound that is a waste product of protein metabolism. It is composed of urea and nitrogen.\n3. Creatinine: This is a chemical compound that is a waste product of muscle metabolism. It is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle.\n4. Intravenous contrast material: This is a chemical substance that is used in medical imaging to improve the visibility of internal structures. The specific chemical composition of the contrast material will depend on the type used.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and intravenous contrast material."},
