Segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis: Although not a chemical in the traditional sense, this is a pathological term for a type of kidney inflammation characterized by damage to the glomeruli, which are filtering structures in the kidneys. The term \"necrotizing\" refers to the death of cells due to injury.\n\n3. Staphylococcal endocarditis: This is a bacterial infection of the inner layer of the heart, specifically the heart valves. The term \"staphylococcal\" refers to the bacterial genus Staphylococcus, which is responsible for the infection. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of this condition.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the antibiotic Rifampicin and the bacterial genus Staphylococcus."},
