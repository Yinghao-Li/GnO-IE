It is not a chemical itself but a condition caused by an imbalance of a chemical in the body.\n2. Prolactin: This is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. It is a chemical messenger that plays a role in lactation.\n3. DA: This is an abbreviation for dopamine, which is a type of neurotransmitter, a chemical that transmits signals in the brain.\n4. Concentrations: This refers to the amount of a substance (in this case, dopamine) present in a given volume or area.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are prolactin and dopamine."},
