Therefore, we can consider \"jaundice\" a \"Disease\" entity.\n3. \"death\" - While not a disease itself, death can be a consequence of various diseases and medical conditions. In this context, it is being discussed as an outcome for patients with liver disease, so we can consider it a \"Disease\" entity.\n4. \"liver disease\" - Although not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, the discussion of liver transplantation, jaundice, and death suggests that the patients in this group are suffering from some form of liver disease.
