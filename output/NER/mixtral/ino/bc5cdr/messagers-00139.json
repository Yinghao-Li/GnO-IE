Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it is being used to describe a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential disease-related words/phrases are:\n\n* tubular necrosis\n* D - AmB - treated rats\n* NS - 718 - treated rats\n\nNow, let's analyze the context of each word/phrase:\n\n* tubular necrosis: This term refers to the death of tubular epithelial cells in the kidney, which can be caused by various factors, including certain medications. In this context, it is used as a kidney-related disease or condition.\n* D - AmB - treated rats: This phrase refers to rats that have been treated with a medication called Amphotericin B (AmB). The \"D\" might indicate a specific dosage or formulation of the drug. The text mentions that these rats showed tubular necrosis, indicating that the drug may have caused kidney damage in this case.\n* NS - 718 - treated rats: This phrase refers to rats that have been treated with a different medication or compound, identified as NS-718. The text states that there was no change in these rats, implying that the treatment did not cause any observable kidney disease.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. tubular necrosis\n2. kidney damage in D - AmB - treated rats"},
