P: This could refer to \"paclitaxel,\" another chemotherapeutic drug often used in combination with gemcitabine.\n3. CR: This stands for \"complete response,\" which is a term used in cancer treatment to describe the disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment.\n4. ORR: This stands for \"overall response rate,\" which is a measure of the proportion of patients who experience a partial or complete response to a given treatment.\n5. Metabolic CR on PET: This refers to a type of imaging study called positron emission tomography (PET), which can be used to assess the metabolic activity of cancer cells. A \"metabolic CR\" on PET would indicate that there is no residual metabolic activity in the area where the cancer was originally detected.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Gemcitabine (GEM)\n* Paclitaxel (P)\n* Complete response (CR)\n* Positron emission tomography (PET)"},
