Dyskinesias are a category of movement disorders that involve involuntary muscle movements.\n\n2. Dystonic dyskinesias: This is a specific type of dyskinesia that is characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both.\n\n3. Onset- and end-of-dose dyskinesias: These are also specific types of dyskinesias that occur at the onset and end of medication dosing in individuals with Parkinson's disease.\n\n4. Choreic mid-dose dyskinesias: This is another specific type of dyskinesia that is characterized by irregular and involuntary movements typically occurring in the limbs during the middle of medication dosing in individuals with Parkinson's disease.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are dyskinesias, dystonic dyskinesias, onset- and end-of-dose dyskinesias, and choreic mid-dose dyskinesias."},
