Neurochemicals are chemical messengers in the nervous system that transmit signals between neurons or from neurons to other cells.\n2. Astroglial dysfunction: Astroglia, also known as astrocytes, are a type of non-neuronal cell in the central nervous system. Dysfunction refers to the impairment of the normal functioning of these cells.\n3. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP): This is a protein that is expressed in astrocytes and is often used as a marker for astrocytic activation or injury. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that the levels of GFAP were transiently increased at 3 days.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are neurochemical, astroglial dysfunction, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)."},
