Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph you provided, there are two potential disease-related phrases:\n\na. cocaine-induced seizures\nb. significantly reducing mortality\n\nLet's analyze the context of each phrase:\n\na. cocaine-induced seizures - This phrase refers to a medical condition where an individual experiences seizures due to cocaine use. Cocaine is a well-known illicit drug, and seizures are a known complication of its use. Therefore, \"cocaine-induced seizures\" can be identified as a disease entity.\n\nb. significantly reducing mortality - While this phrase does not directly refer to a specific disease, it is related to a disease's outcome or consequence. Reducing mortality implies preventing or minimizing death due to a disease or medical condition. In this context, it is associated with the disease entity \"cocaine-induced seizures.\"\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cocaine-induced seizures"},
