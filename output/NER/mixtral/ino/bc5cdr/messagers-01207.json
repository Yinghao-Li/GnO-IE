Analyze each potential chemical entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text are:\n\n* NO synthase inhibitor\n* LNNA\n* 0.5 g / L\n* drinking water\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each potential chemical entity:\n\n* NO synthase inhibitor: This is a class of chemicals that inhibit the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. It is a general term and not a specific chemical name.\n* LNNA: This is an abbreviation for NG-nitro-L-arginine, which is a specific chemical compound used as a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.\n* 0.5 g / L: This is a unit of measurement for a concentration of a substance in a solution, where g stands for grams and L stands for liters. It is not a chemical entity.\n* drinking water: This is a general term for water that is safe for drinking and does not refer to a specific chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"LNNA\"."},
