Analyze the context of these words or phrases to determine if they refer to a disease.\n3. In this paragraph, the potential disease-related phrase is \"immunoallergic mechanism.\"\n4. Immunoallergic mechanism refers to an immune response that leads to allergic reactions. While it is not a disease itself, it can be associated with various diseases such as allergies, asthma, or autoimmune disorders.\n5. However, without further context or information about the patients mentioned, it is difficult to pinpoint specific diseases related to the immunoallergic mechanism in this case.\n\nConclusion: Based on the given paragraph, we can identify the \"Disease\" entities as potentially including various conditions associated with an immunoallergic mechanism, such as allergies, asthma, or autoimmune disorders. But, more context is needed to determine specific diseases."},
