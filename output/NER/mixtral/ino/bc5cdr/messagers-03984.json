However, there are mentions of certain biological substances and drugs, such as:\n * CCK-8-SE\n * CCK-8-NS\n * Caerulein\n3. These substances are used in medical research and can be associated with certain medical conditions or diseases indirectly.\n4. CCK (Cholecystokinin) is a hormone that plays a role in digestion and appetite regulation.\n5. Dysregulation of CCK has been linked to various gastrointestinal disorders, such as:\n * Gastritis\n * Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n * Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n * Functional dyspepsia\n6. Caerulein is a peptide hormone that can stimulate the production of digestive enzymes and is used in research related to pancreatic diseases.\n7. However, without further context or specific connections to diseases in the paragraph, it is challenging to definitively identify any \"Disease\" entities."},
