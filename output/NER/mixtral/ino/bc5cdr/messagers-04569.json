OC: In this context, \"OC\" most likely stands for \"Oral Contraceptives.\" Oral contraceptives are medications that contain synthetic hormones to prevent pregnancy. Therefore, \"oral contraceptives\" can be considered chemical entities.\n3. Different types of OC: This refers to the different formulations of oral contraceptives, which contain various combinations and doses of synthetic hormones. As such, they can also be considered chemical entities.\n4. Potential confounding factors: While not chemicals themselves, these factors could include various medical conditions, lifestyle factors, or other medications that could affect the risk of VTE in users of oral contraceptives. Some of these factors could potentially be chemical in nature, such as other medications or illicit substances. However, without further information, it is not possible to identify specific chemical entities that might be included in this category."},
