In the context of the paragraph, platinum is used in the form of platinum-based drugs, such as cisplatin or carboplatin, which are commonly used in chemotherapy to treat various cancers, including ovarian and fallopian tube cancers.\n2. Paclitaxel: It is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat various cancers, including ovarian and breast cancers. It is derived from the Pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia) and works by stabilizing microtubules, which are important components of the cell's cytoskeleton, thereby preventing cell division and leading to cancer cell death.\n3. Liposomal doxorubicin: It is a formulation of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, which is encapsulated in liposomes, or tiny lipid vesicles. This formulation allows for targeted delivery of the drug to cancer cells, reducing its toxicity to normal cells and increasing its efficacy in treating cancer.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are platinum, paclitaxel, and liposomal doxorubicin."},
