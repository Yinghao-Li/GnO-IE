Neuronal damage - While not a specific disease, neuronal damage is a common characteristic of many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other degenerative conditions.\n2. Neuronal distortion - Similar to neuronal damage, neuronal distortion can be a sign of various neurological diseases, depending on the context.\n\nKeep in mind that these entities are not specific diseases but rather potential indicators of neurological issues."},
