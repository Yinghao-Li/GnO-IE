L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias: This is a complication of Parkinson's disease treatment, specifically the use of levodopa (L-DOPA) therapy. Dyskinesias are involuntary movements, so this can also be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Parkinson's disease, bradykinesia, rigidity, and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias."},
