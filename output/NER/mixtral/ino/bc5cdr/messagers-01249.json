However, in the context of this paragraph, it is being mentioned as a potential disease marker, specifically as a target of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in certain autoimmune diseases such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).\n2. Proteinase 3: This is another type of enzyme found in neutrophils. Similar to myeloperoxidase, it can also be a target of ANCAs in autoimmune diseases such as GPA or EGPA.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, which includes diseases such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).\n* The specific mentions of myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3 are not diseases themselves, but rather markers of potential disease activity in ANCA-associated vasculitis."},
