Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential disease-related words/phrases are:\n\n* cardiotoxicity\n\nNow, let's analyze the context:\n\n* cardiotoxicity: It refers to the quality of being toxic to the heart or cardiovascular system. It is a condition that can be caused by various substances, including drugs or toxins. In this case, cardiotoxicity is mentioned in the context of the combined use of cocaine and ethanol, suggesting that it is the disease or adverse effect being studied.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* cardiotoxicity"},

However, based on the surrounding text, it seems that \"CE\" refers to a chemical entity. But, to accurately identify the chemical entity, we would need more information about what \"CE\" stands for.\n2. Cocaine: This is a chemical entity that is mentioned in the paragraph. Cocaine is a powerful stimulant drug that is made from the leaves of the coca plant.\n3. Ethanol: This is another chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid. It is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages and is used as a solvent and an antiseptic.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are CE (if more information is provided about what it stands for), cocaine, and ethanol."},

Cocaine: This is a clear chemical reference, as it is a well-known drug made from the leaves of the coca plant.\n3. Ethanol: This is also a clear chemical reference, as it is a well-known chemical compound with the formula C2H5OH, which is commonly found in alcoholic beverages.\n\nTherefore, the relevant chemical entities in the paragraph are cocaine and ethanol."},
