The third disease mentioned is \"hydroureteronephrosis,\" which is a condition characterized by dilation of the ureter and renal pelvis due to obstruction.\n4. The fourth disease mentioned is \"ureterovesical junction obstruction,\" which is a condition characterized by blockage at the junction of the ureter and bladder.\n5. The fifth disease mentioned is the side effect of \"cyclophosphamide,\" which is a medication used to treat various conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases, but can also cause damage to the urinary tract, including hematuria.\n\nSo the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cerebral vasculitis\n* Gross hematuria\n* Hydroureteronephrosis\n* Ureterovesical junction obstruction\n* Side effect of Cyclophosphamide\n\nIt is important to note that the last one is not a disease but a side effect of a medication, but I included it as it is a medical condition that affects the patient."},
