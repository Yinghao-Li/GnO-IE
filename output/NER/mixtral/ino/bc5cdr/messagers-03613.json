Analyze the remaining words or phrases to confirm if they refer to a disease.\n\nApplying this process to the paragraph:\n\n1. Potential disease-related words or phrases: cardiovascular disease, pathogenesis, cardiovascular diseases\n2. Narrowing down:\n * Pathogenesis refers to the mechanism by which a disease arises, develops, and becomes worse. It is not a disease itself.\n * Cardiovascular diseases is a broad term that refers to several conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels.\n3. Confirming if they refer to a disease:\n * Cardiovascular disease is a well-known disease category that includes various conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and hypertension.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* cardiovascular disease\n* cardiovascular diseases"},

In the context of the paragraph, calcium is mentioned as an important factor in the development of cardiovascular disease.\n\n2.
