Analyze each identified entity for confirmation.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text are:\n\n* Iodine\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each identified entity:\n\n* Iodine: It is a chemical element with the symbol I and atomic number 53. It belongs to the halogen group and is a lustrous, solid non-metal under standard conditions that melts at 114째C (237째F) and boils at 184째C (363째F). Iodine is used in medicine, photography, and dyes, and as a catalyst in the production of acetic acid. In this context, iodine is the chemical being excreted, making it a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Iodine"},
