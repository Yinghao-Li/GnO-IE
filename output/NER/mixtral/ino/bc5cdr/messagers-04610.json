The \"d, l\" refers to the optical isomers of the drug. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements of atoms. In this case, \"d\" and \"l\" refer to the dextro- and levo-isomers of sotalol, respectively.\n\nNote: I'm assuming that \"d, l\" is part of the drug name in this context, as it is written without a space and follows the naming convention for isomers.
