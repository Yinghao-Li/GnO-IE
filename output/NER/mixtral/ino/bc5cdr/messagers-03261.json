It is a chemical entity because it is a specific molecule with a unique structure and function.\n2. WT: This stands for Wild Type, which refers to a control group in genetic experiments that have not been modified. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a term used to describe a group of organisms with normal, unaltered genes.\n3. PKCa KO: This stands for Protein Kinase C alpha Knockout, which refers to a group of organisms that have been genetically modified to lack the PKCa gene. Like WT, PKCa KO is not a chemical entity, but rather a term used to describe a group of organisms.\n4. medullary tissues: This refers to the inner part of a kidney, which is responsible for concentrating urine. While not a specific chemical entity, it is a type of biological tissue that contains various chemicals and molecules.\n5. 3 and 5 days: These are time intervals and do not refer to any specific chemical entities.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entities in the paragraph are AQP2 and medullary tissues."},
