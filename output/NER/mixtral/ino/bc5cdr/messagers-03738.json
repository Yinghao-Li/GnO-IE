While it is not a chemical, it is a medical term that is often used in the context of discussing various chemicals and medications that can affect heart function.\n2. VIP: This stands for vasoactive intestinal peptide, which is a type of chemical messenger called a neuropeptide. VIP is involved in regulating a variety of bodily functions, including the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract.\n3. pg: This stands for picogram, which is a unit of measurement used to describe very small amounts of a substance. In this case, it is being used to quantify the amount of VIP present in the patients' bodies.\n4. mg: This stands for milligram, which is a unit of measurement used to describe larger amounts of a substance. In this case, it is being used to describe the amount of protein in the patients' bodies, which is being used as a basis for measuring the amount of VIP.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide), pg (picogram), and mg (milligram)."},
