It is considered a disease entity.\n* Postoperative complication: This refers to an adverse event or condition that arises after a surgical procedure. While not a disease itself, it can be related to various diseases or medical conditions.\n* Cardiac surgery: This refers to a medical procedure performed on the heart or its blood vessels. It is not a disease entity but rather a medical intervention for various heart-related diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Convulsive seizures"},
