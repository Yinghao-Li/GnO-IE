They are produced by the adrenal glands and play a crucial role in the body's \"fight or flight\" response. In the given paragraph, plasma catecholamines refer to the levels of these hormones found in the blood.\n2. Plasma renin activity: Renin is an enzyme produced by the kidneys that plays a key role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which helps regulate blood pressure and fluid balance. Plasma renin activity refers to the level of active renin present in the blood.\n3. Norepinephrine: As mentioned earlier, norepinephrine is a catecholamine hormone that functions as a neurotransmitter and a hormone. In this paragraph, it is mentioned separately from plasma catecholamines, and its pressor effects (the ability to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure) are discussed.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are plasma catecholamines, plasma renin activity, and norepinephrine."},
