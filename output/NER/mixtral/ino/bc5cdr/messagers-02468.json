Plasma pharmacokinetic studies: While not a chemical itself, this term refers to the study of the movement of a chemical (in this case, busulfan) into, through, and out of the plasma.\n\n3. Clearance: In pharmacology, clearance is a measure of the body's ability to remove a chemical (such as a drug) from the blood.\n\n4. mg/kg: This is a unit of measurement for dosage, with \"mg\" standing for milligrams and \"kg\" for kilograms. It is used to calculate the appropriate amount of a chemical (such as a drug) to administer based on a patient's weight.\n\n5. Anticancer or myeloablative effects: These are the effects of busulfan on the body. Anticancer refers to the drug's ability to kill cancer cells, while myeloablative refers to its ability to destroy bone marrow cells. Both of these effects are related to the drug's chemical properties and mechanism of action."},
