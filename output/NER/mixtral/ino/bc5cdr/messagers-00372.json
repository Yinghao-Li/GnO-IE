If you have a different paragraph or a longer one that might contain chemical terms, please let me know and I will be happy to help you identify them.\n\nHere are some examples of chemical entities that you might find in a text:\n\n* Names of chemical elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, or carbon\n* Names of chemical compounds, such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), or sodium chloride (NaCl)\n* Names of chemical groups or functional groups, such as aldehyde, ketone, or ester\n* Names of chemical reactions, such as combustion, neutralization, or esterification\n* Names of chemical units, such as mole, gram, or milliliter\n* Chemical equations, such as 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O\n\nIf you have a paragraph that contains any of these or similar chemical terms, I will be happy to help you identify them."},

In this exothermic reaction, two molecules of hydrogen (H2) combine with one molecule of oxygen (O2) to form two molecules of water (H2O) and release a large amount of energy.\n\nIdentified chemical entities:\n\n* Hydrogen (H2)\n* Oxygen (O2)\n* Water (H2O)\n\nI hope this helps.
