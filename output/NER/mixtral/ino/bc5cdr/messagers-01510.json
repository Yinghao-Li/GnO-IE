Analyze each word or phrase to determine if it is a chemical entity.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential chemical entity is:\n\n* S - 100 protein\n\nTo confirm if \"S - 100 protein\" is a chemical entity, let's analyze it further:\n\n1. S is a symbol often used in chemistry to denote a particular substance or compound.\n2. 100 is a number, and in this context, it likely refers to a specific type of S protein.\n3. Protein is a large biomolecule consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues.\n\nTherefore, \"S - 100 protein\" is indeed a chemical entity, specifically a type of protein."},
