This fluid collects in the numerous air sacs in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.\n2. Shock: In the medical context, shock refers to a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can lead to a lack of oxygen and nutrients to the body's organs and tissues.\n3. Lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's immune system.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Pulmonary edema, Shock, and Lymphoma."},
