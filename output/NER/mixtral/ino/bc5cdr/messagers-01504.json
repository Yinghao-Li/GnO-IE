The paragraph mentions \"SNR,\" but it is not clear what this abbreviation stands for, so we cannot determine if it is a chemical entity.\n3. The paragraph mentions \"immunohistochemical techniques,\" which are analytical techniques used to detect the presence or location of certain proteins or antigens in tissues. These techniques are not chemicals themselves, but they involve the use of chemicals.\n4. The paragraph also mentions \"neurons\" and \"astroyctes,\" which are types of cells found in the nervous system. While they are not chemicals, they are often the subject of chemical analysis.\n5. Based on the information provided, the only clear chemical entities in the paragraph are the ones used in the immunohistochemical techniques. However, the specific chemicals are not mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are the reagents and chemicals used in the immunohistochemical techniques."},
