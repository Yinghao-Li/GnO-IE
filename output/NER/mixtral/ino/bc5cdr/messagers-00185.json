Identify the context: The paragraph is about a clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of Olanzapine and placebo in improving symptoms as measured by the Y-MRS total score.\n2. Look for the key words indicating diseases or conditions: The text does not explicitly mention any specific diseases or conditions, but it refers to \"symptoms\" and a \"score\" (Y-MRS total score) that measures the severity of those symptoms.\n3. Identify the entities being measured or treated: In this case, the entities are the patients who received Olanzapine or placebo treatment.\n4. Determine if the entities can be considered \"Disease\" entities: Since the text discusses symptoms and their improvement, it implies that the patients are being treated for some underlying conditions or diseases. However, the specific diseases or conditions are not mentioned.\n\nConclusion: The text does not explicitly mention any \"Disease\" entities, but it implies that the patients being treated have some underlying conditions or diseases that are being measured and treated with Olanzapine or placebo."},
