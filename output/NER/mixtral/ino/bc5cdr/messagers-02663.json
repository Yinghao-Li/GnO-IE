Body weight: While not a chemical itself, body weight can be affected by the administration of various chemical substances, so it is sometimes considered a chemical entity in a broad sense.\n3. Necrosis: This is a pathological process that can be caused by various chemical substances, such as toxins or drugs.\n4. TAP: This is an abbreviation that could refer to a variety of different chemical compounds, depending on the context. Without more information, it is difficult to say for sure what TAP stands for in this case.\n5. DNA SBs: This is an abbreviation that could refer to DNA single-strand breaks, which are a type of DNA damage that can be caused by various chemical agents. However, without more context, it is difficult to say for sure what DNA SBs refers to in this case.\n\nOverall, the chemical entities in this paragraph include dose, necrosis, and possibly TAP and DNA SBs."},
