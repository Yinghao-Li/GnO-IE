Radiotherapy: While not a chemical in the traditional sense, radiotherapy involves the use of ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells. The radiation itself can be considered a chemical entity, as it is made up of particles or waves with specific properties and behaviors.\n3. Unresectable glioblastoma: Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer, and \"unresectable\" means that the tumor cannot be removed through surgery. While glioblastoma is not a chemical entity, it is mentioned in the context of a study involving Topotecan and radiotherapy.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Topotecan and radiotherapy."},
