Lovastatin\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Lipid is a broad term that can refer to both chemical and biological entities. I included it in my previous answer because it is a key concept in the paragraph, but it is not a specific chemical entity.\n* LDL, HDL, and cholesterol are all specific chemical entities that are relevant to the topic of the paragraph.\n* Gemfibrozil and lovastatin are medications that are used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. They are classified as lipid-lowering drugs and are therefore chemical entities."},
