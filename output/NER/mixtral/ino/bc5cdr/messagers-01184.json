Analyze the context and determine if they are indeed being referred to as diseases.\n\nIn this paragraph, there is no clear mention of any specific diseases. The text discusses left ventricular hypertrophy (LV hypertrophy) in rats treated with Iso, but LV hypertrophy is a condition rather than a disease. It is a thickening of the walls of the heart's main pumping chamber (the left ventricle), which can be a response to various conditions, such as high blood pressure or heart valve problems. Therefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},
