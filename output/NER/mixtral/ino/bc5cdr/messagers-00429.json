Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n\n* toxicity\n* bladder\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the context:\n\n* toxicity - While toxicity itself is not a disease, it can be a symptom or consequence of a disease or condition. However, in this context, it seems to be referring to the adverse effects of cyclophosphamide on the bladder.\n* bladder - The bladder is an organ, and while diseases can affect organs, the text does not explicitly mention any bladder-related diseases.\n\nBased on the provided paragraph, there are no clear \"Disease\" entities mentioned. The text discusses the toxicity of a chemical (cyclophosphamide) on a specific organ (the bladder) in two strains of mice, but it does not explicitly mention any diseases."},
