Analyze each potential entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text:\n\n* Immunofluorescence\n* P2X3\n* NK1\n* receptors\n* bladder\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each potential entity:\n\n* Immunofluorescence: It is a technique used to detect specific proteins or other antigens in biological samples. It is not a chemical, so we can exclude it.\n* P2X3: It is a protein and a subtype of the P2X family of ionotropic purinergic receptors. It is not a chemical, so we can exclude it.\n* NK1: It is a gene that encodes a receptor for substance P, a neuropeptide involved in pain transmission. It is not a chemical, so we can exclude it.\n* receptors: In this context, it refers to protein molecules on the surface of cells that receive chemical signals from outside the cell. It is not a chemical, so we can exclude it.\n* bladder: It is an organ in the human body, not a chemical.\n\nConclusion:\nThere are no chemical entities in the given paragraph."},
