Therefore, the relevant and clear \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is \"HUS\".\n4. The term \"it\" in the sentence could refer to an unspecified disease, but it is not clear and specific, so it is not a relevant \"Disease\" entity.\n5. The term \"cisplatin\" is a chemical compound used in cancer treatment, it is not a disease, so it is not a relevant \"Disease\" entity.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n* Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS)"},
