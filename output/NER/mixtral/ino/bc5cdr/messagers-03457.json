It is a non-selective beta-blocker and selective alpha-1 receptor blocker used to treat high blood pressure.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given paragraph, the chemical entity refers to a specific drug or substance that is being discussed. In this case, the drug is labetalol. Labetalol is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, and it is the subject of the paragraph's discussion.\n\nThe paragraph highlights the effects of labetalol on blood pressure, specifically its ability to induce hypotension (low blood pressure) without causing compensatory tachycardia (increased heart rate) or rebound hypertension (a sudden increase in blood pressure after stopping the medication).\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is labetalol."},
