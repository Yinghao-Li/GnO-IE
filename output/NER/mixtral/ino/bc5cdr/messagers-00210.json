MUP: This is not a chemical entity. MUP stands for Motor Unit Potential, which is a measurement in neurophysiology.\n3. Blood pressure: This is not a chemical entity. Blood pressure is a measurement of the force applied to the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood through the body.\n4. Diastolic blood pressure: This is not a chemical entity. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats.\n5. Systolic blood pressure: This is not a chemical entity. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and pushes blood out into the body.\n6. Heart rate: This is not a chemical entity. Heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Methoxamine."},
