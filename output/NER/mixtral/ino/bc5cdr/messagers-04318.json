Verify if they are indeed chemical entities.\n\nStep 1:\n\n* Diazepam\n* Flumazenil\n* 5 mg / kg\n\nStep 2:\n\n* Diazepam: It is a medication, specifically a benzodiazepine. It is used to treat anxiety, seizures, and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. It is a chemical substance.\n* Flumazenil: It is a medication used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines, such as diazepam. It is a chemical substance.\n* 5 mg / kg: This is a dosage amount, not a chemical entity. It specifies the quantity of flumazenil to be administered (5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight).\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are diazepam and flumazenil."},
