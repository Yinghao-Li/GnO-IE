Effect: Not a chemical.\n4. Phenylephrine: This is a chemical. It is a synthetic vasoconstrictor, often used in medical settings to raise blood pressure.\n5. Induced hypertension: Hypertension refers to high blood pressure, and \"induced\" means it was brought about deliberately. Not a chemical.\n6. Reperfusion: This is a medical term referring to the restoration of blood flow to an organ or tissue after a period of ischemia or lack of blood flow.
