Research or use knowledge of medical terminology to determine if the terms refer to a disease.\n3. In the given paragraph, the terms \"cytostatic effect,\" \"tumor,\" and \"VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)\" are identified.\n4. \"Cytostatic effect\" refers to the ability of a substance to inhibit or slow down the growth and division of cells, which is not a disease.\n5. \"Tumor\" is a general term for an abnormal growth of cells, which can be benign or malignant (cancerous). However, without further context, it is not possible to determine if the tumor mentioned is a specific disease.\n6. \"VEGF\" is a protein involved in the formation of blood vessels, and its expression can be associated with various diseases, including cancer.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are not explicitly mentioned. However, the context suggests that the \"antiangiogenic effect\" of temsirolimus may be related to the treatment of a disease, possibly a cancer, that involves the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis)."},

Temsirolimus: This is a chemical entity. It is a drug that belongs to a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply, which helps stop the spread of cancer cells.\n3. Decrease: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a process or action.\n4. Tumor microvessel density: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a biological concept related to the study of cancer.\n5. VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) expression: VEGF is a chemical entity. It is a protein that plays a critical role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. VEGF expression refers to the production or presence of VEGF in a particular context.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"temsirolimus\" and \"VEGF\"."},
