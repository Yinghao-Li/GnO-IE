Onset: This term refers to the beginning of a medical condition or the appearance of a symptom, in this case, seizures.\n4. Maternal brain and CSF concentrations: This refers to the measure of the presence and quantity of a chemical substance in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a mother.\n5.
