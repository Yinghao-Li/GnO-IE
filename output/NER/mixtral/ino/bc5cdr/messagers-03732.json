Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide is a neuropeptide that is involved in the regulation of various functions in the body, including vasodilation and intestinal motility.\n2.

A vasodilator is a substance that causes the blood vessels to widen or relax, which can lower blood pressure and improve blood flow.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and vasodilator."},
