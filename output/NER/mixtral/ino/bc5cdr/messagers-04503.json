PAN nephropathy is a specific form of kidney damage associated with Polyarteritis Nodosa.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"PAN nephropathy\"."},

IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I): This is a naturally occurring hormone in the body, which is a protein.\n4. GH (Growth Hormone) receptor gene expression: Growth Hormone is a hormone, and a receptor gene is a gene that codes for a receptor protein.\n5. IGF-I receptor mRNA: mRNA (messenger RNA) is a type of RNA that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where it serves as a template for protein synthesis. IGF-I receptor mRNA is the messenger RNA that codes for the IGF-I receptor protein.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Puromycin\n* Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I)\n* Growth Hormone (GH)\n* mRNA (messenger RNA)"},
