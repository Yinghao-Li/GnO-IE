It is a medication used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, and other heart disorders.\n\nOther than propranolol, there are no other specific chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph. However, there are some general terms related to chemistry and medicine:\n\n1. Total peripheral resistance: This term is related to the field of physiology and medicine, and it refers to the resistance that the body's peripheral blood vessels offer to the flow of blood. It is not a specific chemical entity, but rather a physiological concept.\n2. Cardiac output: This is another medical term that refers to the volume of blood that the heart pumps per minute. It is not a specific chemical entity, but rather a physiological measurement."},
