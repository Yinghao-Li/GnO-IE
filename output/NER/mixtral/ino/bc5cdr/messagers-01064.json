Heart disease: While not a chemical itself, heart disease is a condition that can be influenced by various chemical substances in the body, such as cholesterol and lipids.\n3. Venous thromboembolism: This is a medical condition involving the formation of blood clots in the veins, which can be influenced by chemicals like fibrinogen, factor VIII, and D-dimer.\n4. Stroke and transient ischaemic attacks: These are cerebrovascular events that can be caused by various chemical substances, such as clotting factors, cholesterol, and homocysteine.\n5. Breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer: These are various types of cancer, which can be influenced by chemical carcinogens and genetic mutations.\n6. Gallbladder disease: This is a medical condition affecting the gallbladder, which can be influenced by chemicals like cholesterol and bile acids.\n7. Cognitive function and dementia: These are conditions related to brain function, which can be influenced by various chemical substances, such as neurotransmitters and beta-amyloid plaques.\n8. Fractures: While not a chemical entity itself, the risk of fractures can be influenced by various chemical substances, such as vitamin D, calcium, and bone density markers.\n9. Quality of life: This is a subjective measure of a person's overall well-being, which can be influenced by various chemical substances, such as neurotransmitters and hormones.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph include hormones, cholesterol, lipids, fibrinogen, factor VIII, D-dimer, clotting factors, cholesterol, homocysteine, chemical carcinogens, genetic mutations, neurotransmitters, beta-amyloid plaques, vitamin D, calcium, and bone density markers."},
