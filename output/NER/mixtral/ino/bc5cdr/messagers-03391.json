The paragraph mentions certain changes in the kidney structure, such as an enlarged Bowman's space, a shrunken glomerular tuft, a reduced cortex width, and an increased nephrogenic zone/cortical zone ratio.\n3. However, these changes in kidney structure do not necessarily translate to a specific \"Disease\" entity. They could be indicative of a disease or a developmental anomaly, but without further context or information, it is not possible to definitively label them as diseases.\n\nTherefore, based on the given paragraph, we cannot identify any specific \"Disease\" entities."},
