It is not a disease entity.\n2. Picrorrhiza kurroa: This is a type of plant used in traditional medicine, and it is not a disease entity.\n3. isoproterenol: This is a synthetic catecholamine used in medicine to stimulate the heart. It can cause myocardial stress, which is not a disease entity itself but a physiological response.\n4. myocardial stress: This is a physiological response to stress on the heart muscle, which can be caused by isoproterenol in this study. It is not a disease entity.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no explicit disease entities mentioned. However, it is important to note that myocardial stress can be a symptom or consequence of various heart diseases, such as ischemic heart disease or heart failure."},
