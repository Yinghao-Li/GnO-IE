Now, let's analyze the context of each word or phrase:\n   - 'Hypoglycaemia' refers to a condition characterized by abnormally low blood glucose (sugar) levels. It is a disease entity.\n   - 'Heart-rate' refers to the number of times a person's heart beats per minute. While it can be indicative of certain health conditions, it is not a disease itself.\n5. Therefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is 'hypoglycaemia'."},

Hypoglycaemia - While this term refers to a condition (low blood sugar), it is often classified as a chemical entity because it is a state characterized by an abnormal concentration of glucose in the blood.\n3. Heart rate - Although not a chemical entity, heart rate is included here because it is a physiological response to the chemical entity insulin.\n4. Diastolic blood pressure - Similar to heart rate, this is a physiological response to the chemical entity insulin.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are insulin and hypoglycaemia."},
