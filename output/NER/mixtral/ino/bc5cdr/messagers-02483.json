It is an ingredient in some foods and is also used in some medical treatments.\n2. Glucose: This is a simple sugar that is a major source of energy for the body. It is also known as dextrose.\n3. Glucose hypometabolism: This refers to a condition in which the body's cells are not able to properly metabolize, or break down, glucose for energy. It can occur in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n4. Alzheimer's disease (AD): This is a progressive brain disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults.\n\nSo the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are galactose, glucose, and glucose hypometabolism."},
