Analyze each entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: The potential chemical entities in the text are \"TNF - a\" and \"IL - 6\".\n\nStep 2:\n\n* TNF - a: TNF stands for Tumor Necrosis Factor. The \"a\" refers to a specific isoform of the factor, TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is therefore a chemical substance.\n* IL - 6: IL stands for Interleukin, which is a type of cytokine. Specifically, IL-6 is a cytokine that acts as both a pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory agent. As a result, IL-6 is also a chemical substance.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are \"TNF - a\" (TNF-alpha) and \"IL - 6\" (IL-6)."},
