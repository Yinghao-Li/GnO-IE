However, in this paragraph, memory deterioration is not explicitly linked to a specific disease. Instead, it is mentioned in the context of an experimental condition (parenteral daily injections of galactose) used to create an animal aging model.\n\nBased on this analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* None explicitly mentioned. The phrase \"memory deterioration\" is a symptom that can be associated with various diseases, but it is not explicitly linked to any specific disease in this paragraph."},
