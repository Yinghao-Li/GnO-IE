Phosphorylation: This is a chemical process, but it is not a chemical entity in this context. It refers to the addition of a phosphate group to a molecule, often a protein.\n3. Betaine: This is a chemical entity. It is a natural substance found in many foods, including beets, spinach, and whole grains. It has a variety of uses in the body, including as an osmolyte, methyl donor, and protector of cells from environmental stress.\n4. Myocardium: This is not a chemical entity. It is a type of tissue, specifically the middle layer of the heart wall.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are isoproterenol and betaine."},
