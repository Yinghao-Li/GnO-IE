Systolic blood pressure (BP): While blood pressure is a physiological concept and not a chemical entity, \"systolic\" specifically refers to the phase of heartbeat when the ventricles are contracting and ejecting blood. In this context, it is used in conjunction with blood pressure measurement, which is a chemical measurement.\n3. Diastolic blood pressure (BP): Similar to systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure is a phase of the heartbeat when the ventricles are relaxing and filling with blood. It is also used in conjunction with blood pressure measurement.\n4. mm Hg: Millimeters of mercury is a unit of pressure used in blood pressure measurement.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are dobutamine, blood pressure (BP), and millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)."},
