Therefore, \"Levodopa\" is a chemical entity.\n* Dyskinesias: This term refers to a group of movement disorders characterized by involuntary muscle movements. While it is not a chemical itself, it is often associated with the use of certain chemicals, such as Levodopa, in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, in this context, \"dyskinesias\" is not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"Levodopa.\""},
