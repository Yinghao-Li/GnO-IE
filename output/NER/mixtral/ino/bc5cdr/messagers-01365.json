Electrocardiography (ECG) recording showed several abnormalities:\n * Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) > 5 x / minute\n * Trigemini\n * Sinoatrial block\n * Positive U wave\n\nAmong these findings, the following can be considered \"Disease\" entities:\n\n* Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) > 5 x / minute: This is an abnormal heart rhythm originating from the ventricles, which can be a disease or a symptom of an underlying heart condition.\n* Sinoatrial block: This is a heart conduction disorder where the sinoatrial node, the heart's natural pacemaker, fails to initiate or conduct electrical impulses properly, which can lead to various heart rhythm abnormalities.\n\nThe other findings, such as palpitation, trigemini, and positive U wave, are either symptoms or ECG findings but not diseases themselves."},
