Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n\n* anxiety\n* glial cerebral changes\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the context:\n\n* Anxiety: Although anxiety is not a disease itself, it can be a symptom of various medical conditions or a standalone disorder. In this context, anxiety is mentioned as an effect of prednisone, so it can be considered a disease entity.\n* Glial cerebral changes: Glial cells are non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system that support and protect neurons. Changes in these cells can be associated with various neurological conditions or diseases. In this context, the term \"glial cerebral changes\" refers to alterations in the brain's glial cells caused by prednisone. Since these changes are a result of an external factor (prednisone), they may not be considered a disease on their own.\n\nDisease entities:\n\n1. Anxiety"},

Anxiety: While anxiety is not a chemical entity, it is mentioned in the context of being induced by Prednisone.\n3. Glial: This term refers to a type of cell found in the central nervous system. It is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of cerebral changes caused by Prednisone.\n4. Cerebral: This term refers to the brain or cerebrum. It is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of changes caused by Prednisone.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Prednisone."},
