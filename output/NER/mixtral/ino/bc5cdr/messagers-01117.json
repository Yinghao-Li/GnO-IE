Myositis is a condition that involves inflammation of the muscle tissues, which can cause pain, weakness, and swelling.\n2. Rhabdomyolysis: Although this condition is not explicitly mentioned as occurring in any patients, it is still considered a disease entity. Rhabdomyolysis is a serious condition that can be caused by muscle damage, and it can lead to the release of muscle contents, such as myoglobin, into the bloodstream.\n3. Myoglobinuria: This is another disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. Myoglobinuria is a condition in which myoglobin, a protein found in muscle tissue, is present in the urine. It can be a sign of muscle damage or injury.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are myositis, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria."},
