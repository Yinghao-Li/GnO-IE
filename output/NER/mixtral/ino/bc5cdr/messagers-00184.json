Adverse events refer to any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient.\n\n2. Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS) rating scales: EPS are a group of symptoms that can occur as side effects of certain medications, particularly antipsychotics. They are not chemical entities either, but rather a set of symptoms.\n\n3. Laboratory values: This term is also not a chemical entity. Laboratory values can include a wide range of measurements, such as blood counts, blood chemistry, and urinalysis, among others.\n\n4. Electrocardiograms (ECGs): These are not chemical entities. ECGs are a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart.\n\n5. Vital signs: This term refers to a set of four measurements that provide important information about a person's overall health, including temperature, pulse, respiration rate, and blood pressure. Vital signs are not chemical entities.\n\n6. Weight change: This term also does not refer to a chemical entity. Weight change can be a result of various factors, including diet, exercise, and medication use.\n\nIn summary, there are no chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
