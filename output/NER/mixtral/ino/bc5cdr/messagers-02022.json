However, the paragraph describes an experiment involving the administration of gentamicin to rats, which can be associated with a condition called \"gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity.\"\n\nGentamicin is an antibiotic, and its prolonged use or high doses can lead to kidney damage, known as nephrotoxicity.
