While \"inotropic\" is not a chemical itself, it refers to a class of chemicals that have a specific physiological effect.\n2. The term \"digoxin\" is a chemical entity. It is a type of cardiac glycoside derived from the foxglove plant, which is used as a medication to treat various heart conditions.\n3. The term \"myocardial infarction\" (MI) is a medical condition rather than a chemical entity. It refers to the death of heart muscle tissue due to the lack of blood supply, commonly known as a heart attack.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"inotropic drugs\" (a class of chemicals) and \"digoxin\" (a specific chemical compound)."},
