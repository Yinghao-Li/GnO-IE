However, in this context, MPO-ANCA titres are not the disease entity but a measurement related to the disease.\n* the reference range: This is a general term used to describe the normal or typical range of values for a particular medical test. It is not a disease entity.\n* untreated Graves' disease patients: Graves' disease is a disease that affects the thyroid gland, causing it to produce too much thyroid hormone. In this context, Graves' disease is the disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is: Graves' disease."},
