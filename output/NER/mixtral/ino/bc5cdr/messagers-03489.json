Biochemical: This term is related to biochemistry, which is the study of the chemical processes within living organisms. It is not a disease entity in this context.\n3. Pathologic: This term is related to pathology, which is the study of the causes and effects of diseases. It is not a disease entity in this context.\n4. Hepatocellular damage: This phrase refers to damage to the liver cells (hepatocytes). It is a condition or a pathological state, and thus can be considered a disease entity.\n5. Drug hypersensitivity: This phrase refers to an abnormal reaction to a drug due to altered immune function. It is a condition or a pathological state, and thus can be considered a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"hepatocellular damage\" and \"drug hypersensitivity.\""},

It is not a chemical, but rather a branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to the blood.\n2. Biochemical: This term refers to the chemical processes and substances that occur within living organisms. It is a broad field that includes the study of enzymes, hormones, metabolic pathways, and other chemical reactions that are essential for life.\n3. Pathologic: This term refers to the scientific study of the causes and effects of diseases.

Drugs are substances that are used to prevent, diagnose, or treat diseases.\n5. Hypersensitivity: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a state of altered reactivity in which the immune system responds in an exaggerated or abnormal way to a substance that is normally harmless.\n6.
