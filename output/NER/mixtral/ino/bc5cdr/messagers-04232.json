Therefore, \"myodystrophy\" can be identified as the \"Disease\" entity in this paragraph.\n\nIt is important to note that myodystrophy is not a specific disease but a category of muscle disorders. However, in this context, it is used as if it were a specific disease induced by the vitamin E deficiency."},
