Research each term to determine if it is a disease.\n\nStep 1: The potential medical terms or phrases in the paragraph are:\n\n* Nociceptin / orphanin FQ\n* Scopolamine\n* Muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist\n* Spontaneous alternation of Y-maze\n* Step-down type passive avoidance tasks\n\nStep 2: Research each term to determine if it is a disease.\n\n* Nociceptin / orphanin FQ: It is not a disease. It is a neuropeptide in the brain and spinal cord that has a role in pain modulation, anxiety, and depression.\n* Scopolamine: It is not a disease. It is a medication that is used to treat motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting. It can also be used to induce memory impairment in research.\n* Muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist: It is not a disease. It is a type of medication that blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that is important for learning and memory.\n* Spontaneous alternation of Y-maze: It is not a disease. It is a behavioral test used to assess spatial memory and learning in rodents.\n* Step-down type passive avoidance tasks: It is not a disease. It is a behavioral test used to assess memory in rodents.\n\nThere are no \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},

Scopolamine: This is a medication that belongs to the class of chemicals known as anticholinergics. It is a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.\n3. Muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist: This is a type of chemical that blocks the activity of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which are found in the nervous system and are involved in the transmission of nerve impulses.\n4.
