Improves axial symptoms: Axial symptoms in Parkinson's disease include problems with gait, balance, and posture. These symptoms are also related to the chemical dopamine and its deficiency in the brain.\n3. Levodopa: This is a chemical entity, specifically a precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine.
