AT2R: This is likely short for \"Angiotensin II receptor type 2,\" which is a type of protein that is activated by the hormone angiotensin II and plays a role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance.\n2. PCE: This is likely short for \"Phencyclidine,\" which is a dissociative anesthetic drug that has been abused for its mind-altering effects.\n3. Gene expression: This refers to the process by which the information encoded in a gene is used to produce a functional gene product, such as a protein.\n4. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF): This is a protein that is involved in the survival, development, and function of certain types of neurons in the nervous system.\n5. Tyrosine kinase receptor (c-Ret): This is a type of protein that is involved in transmitting signals from the outside of a cell to the inside. It is activated by certain growth factors, including GDNF.\n6. Signaling pathway: This refers to a series of molecular events that occur within a cell in response to a signal from the outside. In this case, the signaling pathway refers to the series of events that occurs when GDNF binds to its receptor, c-Ret, and activates it.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are PCE, which is a drug, and the various proteins and genes that are mentioned, including AT2R, GDNF, and c-Ret."},
