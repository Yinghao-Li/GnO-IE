Angiotensin-converting enzyme is a specific enzyme that is involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which helps regulate blood pressure and fluid balance in the body.\n\n2. ACE inhibitors - This is another chemical entity. ACE inhibitors are a class of medications that are used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and other conditions. They work by inhibiting the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme, which leads to relaxation of blood vessels and decreased blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE inhibitors."},
