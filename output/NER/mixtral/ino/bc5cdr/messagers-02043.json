CD4 + T - cell counts: While not a chemical in the traditional sense, CD4+ T cells are a type of white blood cell in the human immune system, and the \"counts\" refer to the number of these cells. The CD4 protein on the surface of these cells is a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and a decrease in CD4+ T cell counts is a hallmark of HIV infection and AIDS. However, in this context, the focus is on the measurement of these cells, so we can consider \"CD4 + T - cell counts\" to be a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"alcohol\" and \"CD4 + T - cell counts\"."},
