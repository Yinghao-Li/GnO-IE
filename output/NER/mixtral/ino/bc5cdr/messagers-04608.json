Sotalol is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called beta blockers, which are used to treat various heart conditions. The \"d\" and \"l\" refer to the optical isomers of the drug, which can have different effects in the body.\n\nThere are no other chemical entities explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. However, there are a few medical conditions mentioned that are related to the function of certain chemicals in the body:\n\n1. Coronary artery disease: This is a condition in which the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked, often due to the buildup of cholesterol and other substances.\n2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: This is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and stretched, leading to an enlarged heart and reduced pumping ability.\n3. Ventricular tachycardia: This is a rapid heart rhythm that originates in the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles).\n4. Ventricular fibrillation: This is a life-threatening heart rhythm disorder in which the ventricles quiver and are unable to effectively pump blood.\n\nWhile these conditions are not chemicals themselves, they are closely related to the function of various chemicals in the body, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and other signaling molecules."},
