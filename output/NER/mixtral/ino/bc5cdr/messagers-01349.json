They are often used for pain relief and to reduce inflammation.\n2. NS-NSAIDs: This stands for non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These are a class of drugs that reduce pain, inflammation, and fever. They work by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are involved in the production of prostaglandins, a type of inflammatory compound.\n3. Acetaminophen: Also known as paracetamol, this is a common over-the-counter medication used for pain relief and fever reduction. It is not an NSAID and works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are COX-2 inhibitors, NS-NSAIDs, and acetaminophen."},
