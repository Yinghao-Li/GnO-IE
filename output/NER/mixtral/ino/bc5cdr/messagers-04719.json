Cocaine is a well-known illicit drug that can have harmful effects on the human body, including cardiovascular problems.\n* \"Deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance\" refers to the left ventricle's function in the heart. Systolic and diastolic functions are crucial for the heart's proper functioning. Deterioration of these functions can be a sign of various heart diseases, such as cardiomyopathy or heart failure.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cardiovascular issues related to cocaine use\n2. Potential heart diseases indicated by the deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance"},
