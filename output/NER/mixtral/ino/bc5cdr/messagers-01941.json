In the given paragraph, the text highlights the impact of a particular substance, cocaine, on two types of medical conditions: ischemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke.\n2. A \"disease\" is defined as a disorder or malfunction of the body or one of its parts, which can be temporary or permanent, and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.\n3. In this context, both ischemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke can be classified as diseases since they are medical conditions that affect the normal functioning of the body, specifically the brain.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Ischemic stroke\n* Haemorrhagic stroke"},

It is a powerful stimulant that affects the brain and nervous system.\n2. Ischemic: While not a chemical itself, ischemic refers to a medical condition that is caused by a lack of blood flow to an organ or part of the body. It is often associated with the narrowing or blockage of blood vessels due to the buildup of plaque or fatty deposits.\n3. Haemorrhagic: Similar to ischemic, haemorrhagic is not a chemical but a medical condition. It is characterized by bleeding in or around the brain due to a ruptured blood vessel.\n\nSo, in the given paragraph, the chemical entity is \"Cocaine\"."},
