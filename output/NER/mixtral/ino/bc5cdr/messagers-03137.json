The paragraph describes a medical scenario where a combination of two medications, metoprolol and terbinafine, results in bradycardia. Bradycardia is a condition where the heart rate is slower than normal, but it is not a disease itself. It can be a symptom of an underlying medical condition or a side effect of certain medications. Therefore, in this paragraph, there are no \"Disease\" entities to identify."},

It is a type of beta blocker.\n* Terbinafine is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections of the skin and nails.\n* A combination refers to the act of combining or mixing two or more things together.\n* Bradycardia is a medical condition characterized by a slower-than-normal heart rate.\n\nBased on this information, we can identify \"metoprolol\" and \"terbinafine\" as the chemical entities in the paragraph. They are both medications that were combined and administered, leading to the medical condition of bradycardia."},
