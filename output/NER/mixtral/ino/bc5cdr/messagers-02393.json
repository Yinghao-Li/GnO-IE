The abbreviation \"PFS\" stands for Progression-Free Survival, which is a measure used in medical studies related to disease.\n3.

The term \"CR\" stands for Complete Response, which is a term used to describe the response of a patient's disease to treatment.\n5. The term \"bort\" likely refers to bortezomib, which is a medication used to treat certain types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma.\n6. The term \"dex\" likely refers to dexamethasone, which is a medication used to treat a variety of conditions, including certain types of cancer.\n7. The term \"prior therapy\" likely refers to previous treatments that patients received for their disease.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are likely to be the types of cancer that bortezomib and dexamethasone are used to treat, such as multiple myeloma. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific diseases, so this is an inference based on the context."},
