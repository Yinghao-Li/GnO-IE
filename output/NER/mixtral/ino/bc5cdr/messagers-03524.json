It is not a disease itself.\n* \"beta 1 - adrenoceptor blocking\" is a property of certain medications, including the one mentioned in the paragraph, that blocks the action of beta-1 adrenergic receptors, which are found in the heart and regulate heart rate and contractility. It is not a disease.\n* \"beta 2 - adrenoceptor stimulating properties\" is also a property of certain medications, including the one mentioned in the paragraph, that stimulates the action of beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which are found in the lungs and other organs and regulate various physiological functions. It is not a disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},
