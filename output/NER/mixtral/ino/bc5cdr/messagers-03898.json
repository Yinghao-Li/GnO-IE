It can be a symptom or complication of certain diseases.\n2. Pseudomonas sepsis: This is the primary disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Pseudomonas is a type of bacteria that can cause various types of infections, including sepsis.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are leukopenia (a condition) and Pseudomonas sepsis (a disease)."},
