Diltiazem: This is another chemical entity. It is also a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders.\n3. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: This is a group of chemical entities that are used as peripheral vasodilator agents. They exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue.\n4. Calcium channel blockers: This is a class of chemical entities that are used to treat various cardiovascular conditions. They work by blocking the influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to relaxation of the muscles and decreased blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are verapamil, diltiazem, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and calcium channel blockers."},
