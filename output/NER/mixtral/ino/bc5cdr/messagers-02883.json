Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\n\nThe paragraph mentions that an 84-year-old male received oral pilsicainide to convert his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to a sinus rhythm. Here, 'paroxysmal atrial fibrillation' is a disease entity. It is a type of irregular heartbeat or arrhythmia that comes and goes suddenly and can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related complications."},
