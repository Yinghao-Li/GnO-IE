A spasm refers to a sudden, involuntary contraction of a muscle or a narrowing of a blood vessel. Coronary dissection is a separation of the layers of the coronary artery wall, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Atheromatous etiology refers to the cause of a disease being related to the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in and on the artery walls, which can lead to the formation of plaques and narrowing of the arteries."},
