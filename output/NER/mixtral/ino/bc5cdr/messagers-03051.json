It is considered a disease or abnormal condition in developmental biology.\n2. teratogenicity: It is a type of disease that is characterized by the ability to cause malformations of an embryo or fetus. The specific defects mentioned, ventricular septal defects and wavy ribs, are congenital heart and skeletal abnormalities, respectively.\n3. growth retardation: It is a disease or condition where an individual's growth, in terms of height or weight, is significantly below average compared to peers of the same age and sex.\n\nAll three identified phrases represent diseases or abnormal conditions."},

They are relevant to the context and clearly refer to diseases.\n* N-phenylimide herbicides (S-53482 and S-23121) are not diseases but the causative agents for the mentioned diseases.
