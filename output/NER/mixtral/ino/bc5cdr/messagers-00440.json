However, in this context, it seems to be used in a broader sense, referring to a condition similar to interstitial cystitis.\n* \"Interstitial cystitis\" is a well-known disease in humans, characterized by chronic bladder pain and pressure.\n* The second mention of \"disease\" clearly refers to interstitial cystitis, as it is the object of the comparison made in the sentence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Interstitial cystitis\n2. The (unspecified) pathology in animals, which is being compared to interstitial cystitis in humans."},
