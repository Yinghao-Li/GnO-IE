In this paragraph, there are two diseases mentioned:\n   - Dopaminergic lesion: This refers to damage to the dopamine-producing cells in the brain, which can lead to motor function impairments.\n   - L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias: This is a side effect of long-term treatment with L-DOPA, a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease. Dyskinesias are involuntary movements that can interfere with daily activities.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"Dopaminergic lesion\" and \"L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias\"."},

They are involved in the endocannabinoid system and play a role in neuroprotection.\n2.
