Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph, the potential disease-related words or phrases are:\n\n* adenosine receptor agonists\n* amphetamine-induced hyperactivity\n* cocaine-induced hyperactivity\n\nNow, let's analyze the context of each word or phrase:\n\n1. adenosine receptor agonists: These are not diseases. They are actually substances that stimulate adenosine receptors, which are proteins found on the surface of many cells.\n2. amphetamine-induced hyperactivity: This phrase refers to a state of excessive activity caused by the use of amphetamines, which are a type of psychoactive drug. While not a disease itself, amphetamine-induced hyperactivity can be a symptom of substance abuse or addiction, which are considered diseases.\n3. cocaine-induced hyperactivity: Similar to amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, this phrase refers to a state of excessive activity caused by the use of cocaine, another type of psychoactive drug. Like amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, cocaine-induced hyperactivity can be a symptom of substance abuse or addiction, which are considered diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* substance abuse or addiction (implied)\n\nNote that the paragraph does not explicitly mention any diseases, but the context suggests that amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and cocaine-induced hyperactivity can be symptoms of substance abuse or addiction."},

Amphetamine: This is a type of psychoactive drug that increases the activity of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to increased alertness, energy, and attention.\n3. Cocaine: This is another type of psychoactive drug that inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, leading to increased levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain and resulting in feelings of euphoria and increased energy.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are adenosine receptor agonists, amphetamine, and cocaine."},
