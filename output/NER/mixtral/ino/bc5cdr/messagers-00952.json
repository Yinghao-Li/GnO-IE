Homeostasis: It is a biological term that refers to the ability of an organism or system to maintain equilibrium and stability in its internal environment, despite changes in external conditions. It is not a chemical entity.\n2. Model assessment: This is a general term used to describe the process of evaluating the performance of a statistical or mathematical model. It is not a chemical entity.\n3. Insulin resistance: This is a physiological condition in which cells become less responsive to the hormone insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, and resistance to its effects can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Insulin is a chemical entity, but in this context, it is not the primary focus of the paragraph.\n4. Clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone: These are the names of three different antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotics are a class of drugs used to manage symptoms of psychosis, such as delusions and hallucinations. Clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone are all second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics. They are chemical entities, as they are synthetic compounds that interact with the body's biochemical systems to produce therapeutic effects.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone."},
