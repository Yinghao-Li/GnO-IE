It is a synthetic opioid analgesic drug used to treat moderate to severe pain.\n2. 50 micrograms: This is a unit of measurement for the drug Alfentanil.\n3. kg: This stands for kilogram, a unit of weight.\n4. Suxamethonium: This is another chemical entity. It is a short-acting neuromuscular blocking drug, often used in anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation.\n5. Muscle fasciculations: This is a medical term for involuntary muscle twitches or contractions, which can be a side effect of Suxamethonium.\n6. Intragastric pressure: This is a medical term, but it does not refer to a specific chemical. It is a measure of pressure within the stomach.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Alfentanil and Suxamethonium."},
