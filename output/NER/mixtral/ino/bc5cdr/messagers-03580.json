Analyze the context of each term to confirm if it is being used as a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two disease entities:\n\n1. Diabetes: Mentioned as \"streptozotocin diabetic rats.\" Here, \"diabetic\" is the disease, specifically referring to the condition of diabetes in rats induced by streptozotocin.\n2. Cardiotoxic effect: Although not a disease itself, it is a condition or adverse effect on the heart (cardio-) caused by isoproterenol. This paragraph discusses the normalization of this cardiotoxic effect through acute insulin treatment, which implies that the cardiotoxic effect is a problem or condition that needs to be addressed.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are diabetes and the cardiotoxic effect."},
