Nephropathy: While not a chemical in the traditional sense, nephropathy refers to a disease or damage to the kidneys, which can be caused by exposure to certain chemicals or drugs, including salicylates.\n3. Prostaglandins: These are a group of lipid compounds that are involved in a variety of physiological processes, including inflammation and pain perception. They are synthesized from fatty acids in the body and are therefore considered chemical entities.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Salicylate, Nephropathy (indirectly as a result of exposure to Salicylate), and Prostaglandins."},
