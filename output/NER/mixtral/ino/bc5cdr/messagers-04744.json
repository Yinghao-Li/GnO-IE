This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.\n3. Myocardial infarction: Also known as a heart attack, this occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is blocked, often by a blood clot. This can cause permanent damage to the heart muscle and can be life-threatening.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Coronary vasospasm\n* Myocardial ischemia\n* Myocardial infarction"},

Myocardial ischemia: This is a condition where the blood supply to the heart muscle is restricted, leading to insufficient oxygen supply and damage to the heart muscle. It can be caused by various factors, including the use of certain drugs like sumatriptan.\n3. Myocardial infarction: Also known as a heart attack, this is a serious medical condition where the heart muscle is damaged or destroyed due to a lack of blood supply. It can be caused by various factors, including the use of certain drugs like sumatriptan.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are coronary vasospasm, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction."},
