Verify if the remaining words or phrases refer to a disease or medical condition.\n\nApplying these steps to the paragraph:\n\n1. Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n * indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction\n * well compensated cirrhotic patients\n2. Narrowing down the list by considering context:\n * Both \"indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction\" and \"well compensated cirrhotic patients\" are related to medical conditions.\n3. Verifying if the remaining words or phrases refer to a disease or medical condition:\n * Indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction: Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause kidney problems as a side effect. Renal dysfunction refers to impaired kidney function.\n * Well compensated cirrhotic patients: Cirrhosis is a late-stage liver disease characterized by irreversible scarring of the liver. \"Well compensated\" means that the patient's liver is still functioning relatively well despite the presence of cirrhosis.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction\n* Cirrhosis"},
