    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. hiPS-CMs: This is likely an abbreviation for \"human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes,\" which are a type of cell used in scientific research. While \"hiPS\" and \"CMs\" are abbreviations, they refer to specific types of cells, which can be considered chemical entities in a broad sense.\n2. MEA: This stands for \"multi-electrode array,\" which is a type of tool used to measure the electrical activity of cells. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a device used to study the electrical properties of cells.\n3. FPD: This is likely an abbreviation for \"field potential duration,\" which is a measure of the duration of an action potential in a cardiomyocyte. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a measurement of the electrical properties of cells.\n4. Drug: This is a general term for any substance that is used to modify or treat a medical condition. The specific drugs used in the study are not named in the paragraph, but the term \"drug\" itself can be considered a chemical entity.\n5. Vehicle: In the context of a drug study, the \"vehicle\" is typically a solution that contains no active drug and is used as a control. It is not a chemical entity itself, but it may contain chemical substances such as solvents or preservatives.\n6. Drug concentration: This refers to the amount of drug present in a given volume or mass. It is not a chemical entity itself, but it is a measure of the amount of a chemical substance present.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* hiPS-CMs (human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes)\n* Drug (a general term for any substance used to modify or treat a medical condition)\n* Vehicle (a solution used as a control in a drug study)\n* Drug concentration (a measure of the amount of a drug present in a given volume or mass)"},
