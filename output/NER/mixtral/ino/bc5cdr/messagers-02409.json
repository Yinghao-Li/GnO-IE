High levels of LDH in the blood can indicate tissue damage and is associated with various diseases such as heart attack, liver disease, and muscle damage.\n2. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) - this is an enzyme that is found in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles. High levels of CPK in the blood can indicate tissue damage and is associated with various diseases such as heart attack, muscle damage, and brain injury.\n3. Alanine transaminase (ALT) - this is an enzyme that is found primarily in the liver. High levels of ALT in the blood can indicate liver damage and is associated with various diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.\n4. Aspartate transaminase (AST) - this is an enzyme that is found in various body tissues such as the heart, liver, and muscles. High levels of AST in the blood can indicate tissue damage and is associated with various diseases such as heart attack, liver disease, and muscle damage.\n5. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) - this is an enzyme that plays a key role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which regulates blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. High levels of ACE in the blood can indicate activation of the RAAS system and is associated with various diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, and kidney disease.\n6. Malondialdehyde (MDA) - this is a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, which is a process that occurs when free radicals damage lipids in cell membranes. High levels of MDA in the body can indicate oxidative stress and is associated with various diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n7. Nitric oxide (NO) - this is a signaling molecule that plays a role in various physiological processes such as vasodilation, neurotransmission, and immune function. High levels of NO in the body can indicate inflammation and is associated with various diseases such as sepsis, asthma, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Heart attack\n* Liver disease\n* Muscle damage\n* Brain injury\n* Hepatitis\n* Cirrhosis\n* Liver cancer\n* Hypertension\n* Heart failure\n* Kidney disease\n* Atherosclerosis\n* Cancer\n* Neurodegenerative disorders\n* Sepsis\n* Asthma."},
