Analyze the context to confirm if they are indeed chemical entities.\n\nIn this paragraph, the focus is on the levels of certain substances in mice that have been given lithium. The substances mentioned are sodium, potassium, calcium, and lithium. These are indeed chemical entities.\n\n* Sodium: A chemical element with the symbol Na and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal.\n* Potassium: A chemical element with the symbol K and atomic number 19. It is a soft, silvery-white metal, member of the alkali group of the periodic chart.\n* Calcium: A chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20. It is an alkaline earth metal.\n* Lithium: A chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white metal.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Sodium\n2. Potassium\n3. Calcium\n4. Lithium"},
