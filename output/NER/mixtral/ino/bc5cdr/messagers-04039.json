It is a type of neuromuscular blocking agent that works by inhibiting the action of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n2. Anticholinesterases: These are a class of drugs that work by inhibiting the action of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. By inhibiting this enzyme, anticholinesterases increase the levels of acetylcholine in the body, which can help to reverse the effects of certain types of muscle relaxants, such as succinylcholine.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are succinylcholine and anticholinesterases."},
