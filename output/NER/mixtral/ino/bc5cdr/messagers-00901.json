In this case, the context indicates that it refers to a chemical entity.\n* \"Prevention\" is an action or process, not a chemical.\n* \"VT\" is an abbreviation for ventricular tachycardia, a medical condition, not a chemical.\n* \"Sotalol\" is a specific chemical entity, a medication used to treat heart conditions. Therefore, it is the only chemical entity in the paragraph."},
