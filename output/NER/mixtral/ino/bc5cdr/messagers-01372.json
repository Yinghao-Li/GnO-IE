It is a type of zinc salt that can be used as a dietary supplement or as a medication to treat conditions such as Wilson's disease.\n4. Wilson disease: This is a genetic disorder that affects copper metabolism. It is not a chemical, but it is mentioned in the context of the patient's hepatic presentation and treatment with penicillamine and zinc acetate.\n5. Anxiety: This is a mental health condition, not a chemical.\n6.
