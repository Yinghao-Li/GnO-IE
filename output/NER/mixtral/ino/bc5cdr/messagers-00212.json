    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Direct: While \"direct\" is not a chemical entity, it is often used in chemistry to describe a reaction or interaction that occurs without the need for a catalyst. However, in this context, \"direct\" is being used as an adjective to describe a type of treatment, not a chemical compound or process.\n2. Peripherally acting: This term refers to the location of the drug's action in the body, specifically in the peripheral nervous system. It is not a chemical entity.\n3. Sub-type: This term is used to describe a specific type or category of something, in this case, a subtype of adrenoceptor. It is not a chemical entity.\n4. Alpha1: This is a subtype of adrenoceptor, a type of protein that binds to neurotransmitters in the body. Alpha1 adrenoceptors are found in the smooth muscle of blood vessels and are activated by the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.\n5. Adrenoceptor: This is a type of protein that binds to neurotransmitters in the body. Adrenoceptors are found in the smooth muscle of blood vessels and are activated by the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.\n6. Agonists: This is a type of chemical compound that binds to a receptor and activates it, leading to a response in the body. In this case, the agonists are drugs that bind to and activate alpha1 adrenoceptors.\n7. Piloerection: This is a physiological response in which the hairs on the skin stand up due to contraction of the muscles at the base of the hair follicles. It is often associated with cold temperatures or emotional arousal.\n8. Cardiovascular: This term refers to the heart and blood vessels.\n9. Side effects: These are unwanted or unintended effects that can occur as a result of taking a medication or undergoing a medical treatment.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Alpha1 adrenoceptors\n* Agonists\n* Neurotransmitter norepinephrine (implied)"},
