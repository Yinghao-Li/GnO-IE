Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph \"Cocaine - induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists than amphetamine - induced hyperactivity,\" the potential disease-related phrases are:\n\n* Cocaine-induced hyperactivity\n* Amphetamine-induced hyperactivity\n\nNow, let's analyze the context of these phrases:\n\n* Hyperactivity is not a disease itself but can be a symptom of certain medical conditions, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, in this paragraph, the context is about the effects of cocaine and amphetamine, which are illicit substances. Therefore, \"cocaine-induced hyperactivity\" and \"amphetamine-induced hyperactivity\" refer to the conditions or states caused by the use of these substances, not a disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Cocaine: This is a chemical that is often abused as a stimulant due to its ability to increase the levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain.\n2. Adenosine receptor agonists: These are chemicals that bind to and activate adenosine receptors, which are found on the surface of cells and play a role in a variety of physiological processes, including the regulation of sleep and wakefulness.\n3. Amphetamine: This is a chemical that is similar to cocaine and is also often abused as a stimulant. It works by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain.\n4. Hyperactivity: This is not a chemical, but rather a behavior that can be influenced by the presence of certain chemicals in the body. In this context, it refers to an abnormally high level of activity or restlessness.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are cocaine, adenosine receptor agonists, and amphetamine."},
