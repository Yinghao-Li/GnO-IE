Fungizone: This is a brand name for a medication containing amphotericin B, so it can be considered a chemical entity.\n3. Amphotericin B: This is a chemical entity, as it is an antifungal medication being studied for its toxicity.\n4. Sodium deoxycholate: This is a chemical entity, as it is a component of the Fungizone formulation.\n5. D - AmB: This is an abbreviation for the chemical entity amphotericin B.\n6. Biochemical analysis: While not a chemical entity itself, this term refers to a process involving the study of chemicals, so it is related to chemistry.\n7. Histopathological study: This is a medical study, not a chemical entity.\n8. Kidney: While not a chemical entity, it is mentioned in the context of a study involving chemical entities.\n9. Pharmacokinetic study: This is a medical study, not a chemical entity.\n10. Amphotericin B following intravenous infusion: This refers to the chemical entity amphotericin B in the context of a medical procedure, but the chemical entity itself is still relevant.\n11. Rats: While not a chemical entity, they are mentioned in the context of a study involving chemical entities.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are NS - 718, Fungizone (amphotericin B - sodium deoxycholate), amphotericin B, sodium deoxycholate, and D - AmB."},
