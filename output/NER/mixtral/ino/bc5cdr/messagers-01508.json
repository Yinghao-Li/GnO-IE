It is a protein-rich solution that serves as a medium for various cells and proteins.\n2. Albumin: It is a protein that is produced by the liver and is the most abundant protein in serum. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the osmotic pressure of blood.\n3. Immunoglobulins: They are also known as antibodies and are proteins produced by the immune system to fight against foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins.\n4. Blood-brain barrier: It is a specialized barrier that separates the brain from the bloodstream and protects the brain from harmful substances.\n5. Vasogenic edema: It is a type of brain edema that results from increased permeability of blood vessels in the brain, leading to the accumulation of fluid and swelling in the brain tissue.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are serum, albumin, immunoglobulins, blood-brain barrier, and vasogenic edema."},
