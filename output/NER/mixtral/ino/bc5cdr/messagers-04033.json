Analyze the terms and determine if they are related to a disease or medical condition.\n\nIntraoperative bradycardia - Bradycardia is a medical condition characterized by an abnormally slow heart rate, usually fewer than 60 beats per minute in adults. In this context, it is referring to the occurrence of bradycardia during a surgical procedure (intraoperative).\n\nIntraoperative hypotension - Hypotension is a medical condition characterized by abnormally low blood pressure. In this context, it is referring to the occurrence of hypotension during a surgical procedure (intraoperative).\n\nBoth bradycardia and hypotension are medical conditions, and therefore, they are the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph. Specifically, they are complications associated with the use of timolol and pilocarpine eye drops."},
