However, since it is directly related to the disease of epilepsy, I have included it as a disease entity.\n\nI apologize for any confusion, but \"cognitive deficits\" is not a specific disease, but rather a general term used to describe problems with cognition, or the mental processes involved in acquiring and processing information.
