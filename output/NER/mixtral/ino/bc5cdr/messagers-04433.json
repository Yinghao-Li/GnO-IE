Analyze each word or phrase to determine if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1:\n\n* Epinephrine\n* subtoxic\n* bupivacaine\n* dogs\n\nStep 2:\n\n* Epinephrine: This is a hormone and a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical that transmits signals in the nervous system. It is often referred to as adrenaline.\n* subtoxic: This term is related to toxicity, which can be a chemical property. However, in this context, it is not a specific chemical but a description of a range of doses or concentrations of a chemical (bupivacaine).\n* bupivacaine: This is a local anesthetic, a type of chemical used to numb specific areas of the body.\n* dogs: This is a species of animal, not a chemical.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"Epinephrine\" and \"bupivacaine.\""},
