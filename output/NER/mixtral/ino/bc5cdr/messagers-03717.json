Analyze each potential chemical entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text are:\n\n* naloxone\n* 5 mg / kg\n* control\n* MSG\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each potential chemical entity:\n\n* naloxone: It is a medication used to counteract the effects of opioids, especially in overdoses and poisonings. It is a chemical entity.\n* 5 mg / kg: This is a dosage quantity, not a chemical.\n* control: In this context, it is a group in an experiment and not a chemical.\n* MSG: It stands for Monosodium glutamate, a flavor enhancer commonly added to Chinese food, canned vegetables, soups, and processed meats. It is a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are: naloxone and MSG."},
