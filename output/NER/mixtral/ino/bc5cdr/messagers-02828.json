Dex administration - In this context, \"Dex\" likely refers to a specific drug or medication, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the administration of this drug is related to a specific disease.

Oxidative stress: This is a condition that can be caused by an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants in the body, leading to cellular damage. While not a specific chemical compound, it is a chemical process and therefore a chemical entity.\n3. Dex: This is likely short for a chemical compound, as it is being administered and is involved in the study along with LF. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact compound, but it is a chemical entity in this paragraph.\n4. Hypertension: This is a condition characterized by high blood pressure, which can be caused by a variety of factors including chemical imbalances in the body. While not a specific chemical compound, it is a condition related to chemical processes and therefore a chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are LF, oxidative stress, Dex, and hypertension."},
