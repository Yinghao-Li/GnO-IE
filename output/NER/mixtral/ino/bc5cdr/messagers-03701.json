For instance, we can use spectroscopy to identify the presence of specific elements or compounds based on their unique light absorption patterns. Chromatography is another useful technique, which separates the components of a mixture based on their chemical properties, such as polarity or molecular weight. In addition, we can use mass spectrometry to determine the molecular weight and chemical structure of unknown compounds.\n\nRevised Paragraph:\n\n---\n\nChemical analysis, spectroscopy, specific elements, compounds, light absorption patterns, chromatography, components, chemical properties, polarity, molecular weight, mass spectrometry, molecular weight, chemical structure, unknown compounds."},
