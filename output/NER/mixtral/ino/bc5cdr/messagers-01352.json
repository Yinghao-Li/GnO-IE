Rofecoxib: This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was used to treat pain and inflammation associated with arthritis. It was withdrawn from the market in 2004 due to safety concerns.\n3. Celecoxib: This is another NSAID that is used to treat pain and inflammation associated with arthritis.\n4. NS-NSAIDs: This stands for non-selective NSAIDs, which are a class of medications used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and bring down fever. Examples of NS-NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are arthritis and the various symptoms that the medications are used to treat, such as pain and inflammation. However, it's worth noting that the paragraph itself does not explicitly mention any diseases, but rather focuses on the exposure to different medications among non-users of aspirin."},
