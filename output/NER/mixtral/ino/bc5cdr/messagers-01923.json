However, in this context, \"coronary\" is not used as a disease but rather as a descriptor for the computerized tomography angiography.\n2. Cocaine-associated chest pain: Cocaine use can lead to various health issues, including chest pain. This chest pain can be a symptom of a disease called cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia or cocaine-induced chest pain syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia\n2. Cocaine-induced chest pain syndrome\n\nNote: The term \"low-risk patients\" could also be considered a disease entity, but it is more accurately described as a patient population with a lower risk of a specific disease or adverse outcome."},
