PTRA (Percutaneous Transluminal Renal Angioplasty): It is a medical procedure that uses a balloon catheter to dilate a narrowed or obstructed renal artery. Although PTRA is not a chemical entity, it is mentioned in the context of a medical procedure involving the kidney.\n3. PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention): It is a nonsurgical procedure that uses a catheter to place a small structure called a stent in the heart arteries that have become narrowed or blocked. Similar to PTRA, PCI is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of a medical procedure involving the heart arteries.\n4. mg/dl: It is a unit of measurement for concentration, specifically for mass per unit volume. In this case, it is used to express the concentration of creatinine in the blood.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are creatinine, mg, and dl."},
