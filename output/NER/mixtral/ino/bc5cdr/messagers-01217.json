Schizophrenia\n\nThe only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"schizophrenia.\" The other medical terms, such as \"DRD2 polymorphisms\" and \"chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome,\" refer to specific medical conditions or symptoms, but they do not represent diseases themselves.\n\nDRD2 polymorphisms refer to genetic variations in the dopamine D2 receptor gene, which can influence an individual's susceptibility to certain medical conditions or responses to medications.\n\nChlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome is a side effect of the antipsychotic medication chlorpromazine, which can cause movement disorders and other neurological symptoms.\n\nHowever, schizophrenia is a recognized mental disorder and a disease entity."},

It is a chemical entity because it is a type of molecule that is involved in chemical reactions in the body.\n2. Polymorphisms: This is a term used to describe variations in the DNA sequence of a gene. In this context, the polymorphisms being referred to are likely variations in the DRD2 gene. Polymorphisms are not chemical entities themselves, but they are related to the study of chemicals (in this case, the DRD2 protein) because they can affect the structure and function of the protein.\n3. Chlorpromazine: This is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat various mental and emotional disorders. It is a type of antipsychotic drug that works by blocking the action of dopamine in the brain.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and chlorpromazine."},
