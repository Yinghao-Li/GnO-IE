The paragraph mentions \"cognitive deficits\" and a \"rat model of sAD\".\n3. \"Cognitive deficits\" refer to a decrease in cognitive abilities, which can be a symptom of various diseases, but without further context, it is not possible to identify a specific disease.\n4. \"sAD\" likely refers to \"sporadic Alzheimer's Disease\", which is a specific type of Alzheimer's Disease.\n5. \"Streptozotocin-induced\" indicates that the Alzheimer's Disease in the rat model was caused by the administration of streptozotocin, a chemical used in research to induce diabetes and other conditions.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cognitive deficits (symptom)\n* Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (disease)\n* Streptozotocin-induced Alzheimer's Disease (experimental model of a disease)"},
