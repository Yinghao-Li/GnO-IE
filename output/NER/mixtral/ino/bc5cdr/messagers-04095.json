It is not a chemical entity in the traditional sense, but it is often treated with medications, so I can see why you might ask about it.\n2. Smoke: This is not a chemical entity either, but smoking is a habit that involves the inhalation of smoke produced by the burning of tobacco. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can have harmful effects on the body.\n3. Oral contraceptives: These are medications that contain hormones and are used to prevent pregnancy. The hormones in oral contraceptives are chemicals, so this would be the only true chemical entity in the paragraph.\n\nIn summary, there is only one true chemical entity in the paragraph, which is oral contraceptives. Hypertension and smoke are not chemical entities, but they are related to the use of chemicals in the form of medications and tobacco smoke."},
