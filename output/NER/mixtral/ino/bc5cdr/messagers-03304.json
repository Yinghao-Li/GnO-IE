So, it can be considered a chemical entity in this context.\n2. Cardiac marker enzyme: This is a chemical entity, as enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in the body.\n3. Histopathological variables: These are not chemical entities, but rather they refer to the characteristics of tissue samples that are examined under a microscope.\n4. Expression of protein levels: This refers to the amount of protein present in a sample, so it is related to chemical entities. However, the term \"expression\" in this context is not a chemical entity itself.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"serum\" and \"cardiac marker enzyme.\""},
