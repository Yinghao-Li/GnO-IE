Check the definition and context of \"decreased dark adaptation\".\n\nDecreased dark adaptation refers to the condition where the eye takes a longer time to adjust to darkness than normal. It is often associated with eye diseases or conditions such as retinal disorders, cataracts, or vitamin A deficiency.\n\nTherefore, in this paragraph, \"decreased dark adaptation\" can be identified as the disease entity."},
