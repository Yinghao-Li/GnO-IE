However, without further context, it is difficult to definitively classify this as a disease entity.\n2. \"Respiratory upset\" - This phrase refers to a disturbance or problem related to the respiratory system. It can be classified as a disease entity, as it indicates some form of respiratory distress or issue.\n\nThe second instance, \"one sufficiently severe to necessitate abandoning the technique,\" refers to the severity of the respiratory upset, further emphasizing the presence of a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Respiratory upset"},
