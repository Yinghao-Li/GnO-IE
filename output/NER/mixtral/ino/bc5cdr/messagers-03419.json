According to the CDC, exposure to high levels of arsenic can lead to arsenic poisoning, which can be fatal. Therefore, inorganic arsenic (iAs) in drinking water can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that arsenic itself is not a disease but a harmful substance that can cause diseases. In this context, it is still relevant to identify it as a \"Disease\" entity because the text discusses the harmful effects of exposure to arsenic in drinking water."},
