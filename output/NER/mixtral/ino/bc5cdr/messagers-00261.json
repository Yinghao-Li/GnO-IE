Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it is being used to describe a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph you provided, the potential disease-related words or phrases are:\n\n* MPO - ANCA titres\n* vasculitic disorders\n\nNow, let's analyze the context of each word or phrase:\n\n* MPO - ANCA titres: This refers to the levels of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) against myeloperoxidase (MPO). High levels of MPO-ANCA antibodies are associated with certain diseases, such as vasculitis. However, in this paragraph, the MPO-ANCA titres are mentioned without any clear indication that they are causing any harm or disease. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that MPO-ANCA titres are a \"Disease\" entity in this context.\n* Vasculitic disorders: This refers to a group of diseases that are characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels. In this paragraph, the text states that \"no vasculitic disorders developed\" despite an increase in MPO-ANCA titres. This suggests that vasculitic disorders are being used as a disease entity in this context.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Vasculitic disorders"},
