It is a type of anthracycline antibiotic that interferes with the DNA of cancer cells, preventing them from dividing.\n2. N - (2 - hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide: This is a type of polymer that can be used to deliver drugs, such as doxorubicin, to specific targets in the body. The polymer is modified with a hydroxypropyl group to improve its stability and biocompatibility.\n3. Conjugates: In this context, a conjugate refers to a chemical compound formed by the linking of two or more molecules. Here, doxorubicin is conjugated to the N - (2 - hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide polymer.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are doxorubicin, N - (2 - hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide, and the doxorubicin-N - (2 - hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide conjugate."},
