CCL2, or C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2, is a protein that acts as a signaling molecule in the immune system.\n* expression: This term refers to the production or manifestation of something, often not a chemical. In this context, it refers to the production of CCL2, but it is not a chemical itself.\n* SE: This abbreviation is not a chemical entity. It could potentially stand for \"status epilepticus,\" a condition involving prolonged seizure activity, but it is not a chemical.\n\nSo, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"CCL2.\""},
