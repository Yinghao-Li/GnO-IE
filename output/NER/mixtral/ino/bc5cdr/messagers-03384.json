Analyze the context of each entity to confirm if they are indeed chemicals.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two potential chemical entities:\n\n1. Caffeine\n2. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)\n\nNow, let's analyze the context of each entity:\n\n1. Caffeine: This is an actual chemical compound, a central nervous system stimulant. In this context, it is referring to the caffeine that a pregnant individual might consume, which could then affect the growth of the fetus.\n2. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR): While not a chemical compound, IUGR is a medical condition that can be caused by various factors, including chemical exposure like PCE. It is included here because it is directly related to the chemical entity (caffeine) mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Caffeine\n2. (Indirectly) Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)"},
