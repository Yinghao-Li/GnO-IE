    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Pro-apoptotic effects: While \"pro-apoptotic\" is not a chemical itself, it refers to a biological process that can be influenced by certain chemicals.\n2. Flow cytometric detection: This is a technique used to detect and measure chemical and physical characteristics of cells or particles, but it is not a chemical entity.\n3. Cardiac histology: This is the study of the microscopic structure of heart tissues, and it involves the use of various chemicals for staining and visualization, but it is not a chemical entity itself.\n4. Transmission electron microscopy: This is a technique used to visualize and examine the ultrastructure of cells, including heart cells, using a beam of electrons. It involves the use of various chemicals, but it is not a chemical entity.\n5. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay (TUNEL assay): This is a technique used to detect DNA fragmentation, which is a hallmark of apoptosis or programmed cell death. The assay involves the use of several chemicals, including:\n * Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT): an enzyme used to add biotinylated nucleotides to the 3'-hydroxyl ends of DNA strands.\n * dUTP-biotin: a nucleotide analogue that is labeled with biotin, which can be detected using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate.\n * Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate: a complex that binds to biotin and catalyzes a colorimetric reaction, allowing for the visualization of DNA fragmentation.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)\n2. dUTP-biotin\n3. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate"},
