Cardiac output: Although not a chemical in the traditional sense, cardiac output is a measure of the amount of blood being pumped by the heart in a given period of time. It is a physiological concept, not a chemical entity.\n3. dP/dt (max): This is a measure of the maximum rate of change of pressure over time in the heart. It is a physiological concept, not a chemical entity.\n4. SVO2: This is an abbreviation for \"mixed venous oxygen saturation,\" which is a measure of the percentage of oxygen in the blood in the veins leaving the body's tissues.
