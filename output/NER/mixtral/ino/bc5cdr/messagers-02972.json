Ginsenosides are the main active components of ginseng and have various pharmacological effects.\n2. Rg1: This is another specific ginsenoside found in ginseng.\n3. Rb1: This is yet another specific ginsenoside found in ginseng.\n4. Ginseng: This is a plant (specifically, the root of Panax ginseng) that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Its bioactive components include ginsenosides like Re, Rg1, and Rb1.\n5.
