While not a disease itself, an abnormal level of cardiac enzymes could indicate an underlying heart condition, such as a heart attack.\n\nElectrocardiographic (EKG) changes: An EKG is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. Certain abnormalities in the EKG pattern can indicate various heart conditions, such as arrhythmias, ischemia, or heart attacks. However, an EKG change is not a disease itself but a symptom or sign of an underlying heart condition.\n\nTherefore, in this paragraph, there are no explicit \"Disease\" entities. However, the EKG changes could indicate an underlying heart condition."},
