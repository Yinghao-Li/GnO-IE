It is an enzyme that plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance.\n2. Chronic heart failure (CHF) - While this is a medical condition, it is often associated with certain chemical imbalances or abnormalities in the body, so it can be considered a related chemical entity.\n3. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors - These are a class of drugs that are used to treat various cardiovascular conditions, including CHF. They work by inhibiting the action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which helps to lower blood pressure and reduce the workload on the heart.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), chronic heart failure (CHF), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors."},
