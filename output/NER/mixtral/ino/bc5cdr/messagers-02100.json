In this paragraph, the following diseases are mentioned:\n   - Levodopa-induced motor fluctuations\n   - Dyskinesia\n   - Wearing-off\n\nThese are all conditions related to Parkinson's disease and its treatment with levodopa. Motor fluctuations refer to the predictable return of Parkinson's symptoms (such as tremors or stiffness) that occur when the effects of levodopa wear off. Dyskinesia is a common side effect of long-term levodopa use, characterized by involuntary movements. Wearing-off is a term used to describe the re-emergence of Parkinson's symptoms as the effects of levodopa wear off."},
