Atropine is a naturally occurring bell-shaped alkaloid found in a number of plants, including Atropa belladonna, Datura stramonium, and Hyoscyamus niger. It is a competitive antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and is used in medicine for its anticholinergic effects."},

Atropine\n\nThe paragraph contains only one chemical entity, which is \"Atropine.\" The other terms, such as \"1 mg,\" \"intravenously,\" \"P - P intervals,\" and \"rhythm\" are not chemical entities. Here's a brief explanation of the remaining terms:\n\n* \"1 mg\" is a unit of measurement for the dosage of Atropine.\n* \"Intravenously\" refers to the route of administration of Atropine.\n* \"P - P intervals\" and \"rhythm\" are medical terms related to heart rate and are not chemical entities."},
