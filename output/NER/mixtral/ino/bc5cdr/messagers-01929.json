Analyze the context to confirm if they are being referred to as \"Diseases.\"\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two potential medical conditions:\n\n1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) - Although not explicitly mentioned, the context implies that the patients are receiving coronary CTA (Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography) to evaluate possible CAD.\n2. Elevated cardiac markers - The paragraph mentions \"serial cardiac marker measurements,\" which could indicate myocardial injury or infarction (heart attack).\n\nHowever, neither of these conditions is explicitly referred to as a \"Disease\" in the text. The paragraph focuses on the diagnostic procedures (coronary CTA and cardiac marker measurements) rather than the diseases themselves.

It is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the coronary arteries.\n2. ED (Emergency Department) - This is not a chemical entity. It is a department in a hospital that deals with emergency cases.\n3. Serial markers - This is a possible chemical entity. In medical context, \"serial markers\" often refers to a series of measurements of certain substances in the body, which could be chemical or biological in nature. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the exact chemical entities being referred to.\n4. Cardiac marker measurements - This is another possible chemical entity. Cardiac markers are substances that are released into the bloodstream in response to heart muscle damage. Therefore, measuring these markers can help diagnose heart conditions. Examples of cardiac markers include troponin and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB).\n\nTherefore, the possible chemical entities in the paragraph are \"serial markers\" and \"cardiac marker measurements\".
