Non-metastasizing hepatic neoplasms: These are abnormal growths in the liver that do not spread to other parts of the body. \"Neoplasms\" refers to new and abnormal growths, which can be benign or malignant. In this context, \"hepatic\" refers to the liver, and \"non-metastasizing\" means that these growths do not spread to other organs.\n2. Peliosis: This is a rare condition characterized by the formation of blood-filled cysts in various organs, including the liver and spleen. In this context, peliosis is mentioned as another disease that can develop in patients with androgen- and corticosteroid-treated Fanconi's anemia.\n3. Fanconi's anemia: This is a genetic disorder that affects the bone marrow's ability to produce enough new blood cells. It is often associated with physical abnormalities and a higher risk of developing certain types of cancer. In this context, Fanconi's anemia is mentioned as the underlying condition in patients who can develop non-metastasizing hepatic neoplasms and peliosis after androgen- and corticosteroid treatment."},
