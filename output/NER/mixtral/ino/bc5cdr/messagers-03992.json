AVP\n\nDDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) is a synthetic analog of the natural hormone AVP (arginine vasopressin). Both DDAVP and AVP are used for the treatment of various medical conditions, such as diabetes insipidus, which is not exactly a \"disease\" in the traditional sense. However, they are related to specific medical conditions and are often used in a medical context to manage or treat symptoms.\n\nTherefore, in this paragraph, the disease entities are not explicitly mentioned, but the context is about the administration of DDAVP and AVP for managing certain medical conditions."},

AVP: This is arginine vasopressin, a hormone produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland. It has both antidiuretic and vasopressor effects.\n4.
