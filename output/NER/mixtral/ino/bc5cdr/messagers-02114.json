It is a histamine 2 (H2) antagonist, which is a type of drug used to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and stomach ulcers.\n2. Histamine 2 (H2): While not a chemical in the traditional sense, histamine is a chemical that is released by certain cells in the body in response to an allergen or injury. Histamine 2 (H2) receptors are a specific type of histamine receptor found on the surface of certain cells.\n3. Vasodilatation: This is a process that occurs when the smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels relaxes, causing the vessels to widen. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a physiological response that can be caused by certain chemicals, such as cimetidine.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are cimetidine and histamine 2 (H2)."},
