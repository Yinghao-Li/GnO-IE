Aldosterone antagonist: This is a class of chemical entities that block the effects of aldosterone, a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium balance in the body.\n4. Ramipril: This is another chemical entity. It is an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor, a type of drug used to treat hypertension and heart failure.\n5.
