It is explicitly mentioned in the paragraph.\n* Patients with coronary disease: This phrase refers to individuals who have coronary artery disease, which we have already identified as a disease.\n* Hearts of patients receiving a transplant: Although this does not directly refer to a specific disease, it implies that these patients have a condition that requires a heart transplant, which suggests they have a severe heart disease. However, this is not explicitly stated in the paragraph. Nonetheless, it is still related to heart disease.\n\nDisease entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. Coronary artery disease\n2. (Potentially) A severe heart disease requiring transplant (implied but not explicitly stated)"},
