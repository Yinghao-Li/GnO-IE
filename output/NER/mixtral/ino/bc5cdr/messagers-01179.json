It is a synthetic catecholamine, a type of drug that mimics the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body.\n2. Cardiac hypertrophy: This is a medical condition in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick. It can be caused by various factors, including high blood pressure, heart valve problems, or genetic disorders.\n3.
