Dialysate: This is a chemical solution that is used in the dialysis process. In this case, the dialysate is being specifically referred to as a \"citrate dialysate,\" which means that it contains the chemical compound citrate.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are dialysate (which contains the chemical citrate) and citrate itself."},
