So, we can consider \"anemia\" as a potential disease entity.\n2. 3+ Coombs' test with polyspecific anti-human globulin and monospecific IgG reagents: This test is used to detect the presence of antibodies that attack red blood cells, which can indicate autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Therefore, \"autoimmune hemolytic anemia\" can be considered a disease entity.\n3. Warm reacting autoantibody: This is a type of autoantibody that can be found in the blood of patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Therefore, \"autoimmune hemolytic anemia\" can be considered a disease entity.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"anemia\" and \"autoimmune hemolytic anemia\"."},

It is made up of four globular protein subunits, two alpha and two beta, around a heme group that contains an iron atom.\n2. Coombs' test: This is a type of test used to detect the presence of antibodies or complement components on the surface of red blood cells. It is named after the physician who developed it, Robin Coombs.\n3. Polyspecific anti-human globulin: This is a type of antibody that is used in the Coombs' test to detect the presence of other antibodies on the surface of red blood cells. It is called \"polyspecific\" because it can bind to a wide range of different antibodies.\n4. Monospecific IgG reagents: IgG is a type of antibody that is produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance. Monospecific reagents are those that bind to only one specific type of molecule, in this case, IgG antibodies.\n5. Warm reacting autoantibody: This is a type of antibody that is produced by the immune system and reacts with the body's own red blood cells at body temperature. It is called a \"warm\" autoantibody because it reacts best at warm temperatures.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},
