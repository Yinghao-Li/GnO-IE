STZ stands for streptozotocin, which is a chemical compound used in medical research.

The number 3mg/Kg refers to the dosage of streptozotocin administered, which is 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.\n\nWhile streptozotocin is often used as a diabetes drug, in this context, it is being used to induce memory deficits in rats for research purposes.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* STZ (streptozotocin)\n* ICV (intracerebroventricular)\n* 3mg/Kg (dosage)"},
