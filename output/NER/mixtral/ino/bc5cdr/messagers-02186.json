Oxygen: This is a chemical entity that is being consumed in increased amounts in cardiac fibers.\n3. Complex I and Complex III: These are chemical entities that are involved in the process of oxygen consumption in cardiac fibers. They are part of the electron transport chain, which is a series of complexes that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions, and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H+ ions) across a membrane. This creates a chemiosmotic gradient, which is used by the ATP synthase to create ATP, the main energy currency of the cell."},
