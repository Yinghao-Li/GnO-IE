It is a key component of many signaling molecules and is also used as a dietary supplement.\n2.

It is an important intermediate in the synthesis of various signaling molecules.\n3. MIP synthase: This is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of inositol-1-phosphate from inositol.\n4. Phosphate: This is a negatively charged ion that is formed by the loss of a hydrogen ion from a phosphoric acid molecule. Phosphate is an important component of many biological molecules, including nucleic acids and ATP.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are Myo-inositol, Inositol-1-phosphate (MIP), MIP synthase, and phosphate."},
