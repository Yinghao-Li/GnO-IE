They work by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which leads to the dilation of blood vessels, decreased aldosterone secretion, and reduced blood volume. Examples of ACE inhibitors include captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril.\n- angio-oedema - Angio-oedema is a rapid-onset swelling of the dermis, subcutaneous tissues, mucosa, and submucosal tissues. It can be a hereditary or acquired condition and can be triggered by various factors, including medications (such as ACE inhibitors), food, and environmental factors. Angio-oedema can be life-threatening if it affects the airways."},
