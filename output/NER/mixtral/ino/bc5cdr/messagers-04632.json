Hyperprolactinemia refers to a condition characterized by an excess of prolactin in the blood. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates breast development and milk production in women. When prolactin levels are too high, it can interfere with menstruation and fertility in women and cause erectile dysfunction and decreased libido in men."},
