Fear memory: While not a chemical itself, fear memory is a concept in neuroscience that refers to the brain's ability to remember and respond to threatening stimuli. However, in this context, it is being modified by the chemical apigenin.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are apigenin and fear memory (modified by apigenin)."},
