Hypercalcemia: This is a condition characterized by an elevated level of calcium in the blood.

Bradyarrhythmia: This is a type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, characterized by a slow heart rate. While \"arrhythmia\" is not a chemical entity, \"bradyarrhythmia\" implies a disturbance in the normal electrical activity of the heart, which can be caused by various chemical substances or medications.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are lithium and calcium."},
