Determine which nouns are chemical entities:\n   - CCL2: Yes, it is a protein and a chemical compound\n   - Expression: No, it is a process and not a chemical entity\n   - Hippocampus: No, it is an organ and not a chemical entity\n   - Molecular assay: No, it is a laboratory method and not a chemical entity\n\nTherefore, the chemical entity in the paragraph is \"CCL2\"."},
