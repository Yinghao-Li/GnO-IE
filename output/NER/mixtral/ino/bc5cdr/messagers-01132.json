It is a condition characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries due to the buildup of plaque, which can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the heart muscle and potentially cause a heart attack.\n2. Hyperglyceridemic effect: While this is not a specific disease, it is a condition caused by high levels of triglycerides in the blood. It is mentioned here as a well-known side effect of estrogen therapy.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are Ischaemic coronary arteriosclerosis and hyperglyceridemic effect."},

Ischaemic coronary arteriosclerosis: While not a chemical, it is a medical condition related to the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can lead to heart disease.\n2. CPA therapy: CPA stands for Cyclophosphamide, which is an alkylating agent used in chemotherapy.\n3. HDL cholesterol: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a type of cholesterol that helps remove other forms of cholesterol from your bloodstream.\n4. Apo A - I and Apo A - II: Apolipoprotein A-I and Apolipoprotein A-II are proteins associated with HDL cholesterol and play a role in its metabolism.\n5. Hyperglyceridemic effect: A condition characterized by an excess of triglycerides in the blood, which can be caused by estrogen.\n6. Estrogen: A steroid hormone that is a primary female sex hormone, but also has important functions in males.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are CPA (Cyclophosphamide), HDL cholesterol, Apo A-I, Apo A-II, and estrogen."},
