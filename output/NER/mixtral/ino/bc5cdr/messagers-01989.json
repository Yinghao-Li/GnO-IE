HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4 cells, also known as T cells, which help the immune system fight off infections.\n3. When HIV infects CD4 cells, it makes copies of itself, destroys those cells, and can move on to infect more CD4 cells. Over time, HIV can destroy so many of these cells that the body can't fight off infections and diseases anymore.\n4. Therefore, \"HIV infection\" refers to a disease condition caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus.\n\nHence, the \"Disease\" entity in the given paragraph is \"HIV infection\"."},
