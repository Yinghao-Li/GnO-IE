QT prolongation: This is a \"Disease\" entity as it refers to a medical condition where the QT interval, which is the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the electrical cycle of the heart, is prolonged. This can lead to serious heart rhythm problems.\n2. Hypocalcaemia: This is also a \"Disease\" entity as it refers to a medical condition where there is a low level of calcium in the blood. Calcium is an important mineral that is needed for many functions in the body, including bone formation, muscle contraction, and nerve function. Low levels of calcium can lead to various symptoms, such as muscle cramps, numbness, and seizures."},
