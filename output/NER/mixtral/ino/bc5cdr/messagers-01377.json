A disease is a condition of the body or of a part or organ of the body, in which there is involved a change from a healthy or normal condition.\n3. In the paragraph, the \"Disease\" entity is:\n   - Wilson's disease\n\nExplanation:\n- Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in your liver and other organs. When copper builds up in these organs, it can cause serious damage.\n- The paragraph mentions Wilson's disease in the context of a drug's efficacy in its treatment, which indicates that it is a disease.\n- Therefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is Wilson's disease."},
