Persistent: This is not a chemical entity, but a description of the duration of sterile leukocyturia.\n2. sterile leukocyturia: Leukocyturia refers to the presence of white blood cells (leukocytes) in the urine. Sterile means that no bacteria are present in the urine. So, leukocyturia is the chemical entity here.\n3. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1): This is a virus, which is not a chemical entity.\n4. infected: This is not a chemical entity, but a description of the state of an organism affected by a virus or other microorganism.\n5. children: This is not a chemical entity, but a description of the age group of the individuals being discussed.\n6. treated: This is not a chemical entity, but a description of the action taken for the infected children.\n7. indinavir: This is a chemical entity. It is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV-1 infection.\n8. impaired renal function: Renal function refers to the functioning of the kidneys, which is not a chemical entity. Impaired means that the kidneys are not functioning properly.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"leukocyturia\" and \"indinavir.\""},
