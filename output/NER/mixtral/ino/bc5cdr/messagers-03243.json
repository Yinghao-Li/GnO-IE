Cataract: A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision. It is considered a disease when it progresses to a point where it affects a person's ability to carry out their daily activities.\n2. Ocular hypertension: Ocular hypertension is a condition characterized by increased pressure within the eye. While it is not a disease itself, it can be a risk factor for developing glaucoma, a serious eye disease that can lead to blindness if left untreated.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cataract\n* Glaucoma (implied as a potential consequence of ocular hypertension)"},
