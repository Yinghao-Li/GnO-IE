Chemical engineers must ensure that chemical reactions are carried out safely and efficiently. For example, they may need to monitor the pH levels of a reaction to ensure that it remains within a safe range. They may also need to use chemical solvents to dissolve other substances and facilitate chemical reactions. Additionally, chemical engineers must be familiar with various chemical compounds and their properties, such as the boiling point of a particular solvent or the reactivity of a specific chemical.\n\nChemical entities:\n\n* chemical industry\n* chemical reactions\n* pH levels\n* chemical solvents\n* chemical compounds\n* boiling point\n* reactivity\n\nNote: I have only included entities that are unambiguously related to chemistry and chemical processes.
