When the term \"free\" is used, it usually means that the thiol group is not bound to another group. Thiols are a type of chemical and can be considered a chemical entity.\n* The method of Ellman: This is a specific analytical method, not a chemical entity. However, the method is used to measure the presence of free thiols, so it is relevant to the identification of chemical entities in this context.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entity in the paragraph is \"free thiols\"."},
