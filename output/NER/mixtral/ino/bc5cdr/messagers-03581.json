This condition can lead to heart failure and other cardiovascular complications. In this case, myocardial fibrosis is the result of isoproterenol induction, but it is still considered a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Myocardial fibrosis"},

It refers to the thickening and scarring of the heart muscle, which can lead to decreased heart function and heart failure.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are isoproterenol and myocardial fibrosis (indirectly)."},
