Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph \"PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS : As much as 15 % of lithium-treated patients become hypercalcemic\", the potential disease-related phrase is \"hypercalcemic\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the context:\n\nHypercalcemia is a condition characterized by an elevated level of calcium in the blood. It is not a disease itself but can be a symptom or complication of various medical conditions, such as hyperparathyroidism, cancer, or certain medications like lithium.\n\nSince \"hypercalcemic\" refers to a medical condition (an elevated level of calcium in the blood), it can be considered a disease entity in this context."},
