Analyze each identified entity for confirmation.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two chemical entities:\n\n1. Morphine\n\nTo confirm, I analyzed the term \"morphine\" and found that it is a chemical compound with the formula C17H19NO3. It is an opiate alkaloid that occurs naturally in a number of plants and is also produced synthetically. Morphine is commonly used as a pain medication and is known to have a high potential for addiction.\n\nTherefore, \"morphine\" is a chemical entity in the paragraph.\n\n1. 60 and 90 mg / ml\n\nThis term represents the concentration of morphine in the neonates' plasma. It is expressed in milligrams per milliliter (mg/ml). Although it is not a chemical compound, it is a unit of measurement for the concentration of a chemical substance in a solution.\n\nHence, \"60 and 90 mg / ml\" can be considered chemical entities in the context of this paragraph as they represent the concentration of the chemical compound morphine."},
