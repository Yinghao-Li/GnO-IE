However, elevated levels of these enzymes can indicate liver damage or disease.\n * > 3 times the upper limit of normal: This is a threshold for abnormal levels of AST and ALT, not a disease.\n * < 0 . 3 %: This is a percentage, not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the entities that clearly refer to Disease are \"liver damage or disease,\" which can be inferred from the context of increased AST and ALT levels. However, these terms do not explicitly appear in the paragraph, so the final answer is that there are no clear disease entities in the paragraph."},
