Losartan is a type of drug called an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), which is used to treat high blood pressure and diabetic kidney disease.\n2.

Urea is a waste product that is produced when proteins are broken down in the body. It is normally excreted from the body in urine.\n4. ADR nephropathy: ADR stands for \"adriamycin-induced nephropathy,\" which is a type of kidney disease that is caused by the chemotherapy drug adriamycin. Nephropathy refers to any disease or damage to the kidneys.\n5.
