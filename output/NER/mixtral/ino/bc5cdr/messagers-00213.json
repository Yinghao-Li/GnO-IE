Amino compounds: These are chemical entities. Amino compounds are molecules that contain both amino and carboxyl functional groups. Examples include amino acids, peptides, and proteins.\n3. Structurally related to caproate: Caproate is a chemical entity. It is the carboxylate derivative of hexanoic acid, which is a fatty acid. Therefore, any compounds that are structurally related to caproate would also be chemical entities.\n4. Rats: While not a chemical entity, rats are mentioned in the paragraph as the animal model used in the study.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"amino compounds\" and \"caproate.\""},
