It is an antibiotic used to treat severe infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics.\n2. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) - This is also a chemical entity. ROS are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen. They are naturally produced in the body and play important roles in cell signaling and homeostasis. However, excessive production of ROS can lead to oxidative stress and damage to cells and tissues.\n3. Erdosteine - This is a chemical entity. It is an expectorant agent used to treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It also has antioxidant properties, which means it can neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are vancomycin, reactive oxygen species, and erdosteine."},
