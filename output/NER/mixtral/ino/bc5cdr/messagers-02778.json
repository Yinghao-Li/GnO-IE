Epirubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic used in the treatment of various cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma.\n2. Myocardial strain: While not a chemical in the traditional sense, myocardial strain refers to the degree of deformation that the heart muscle undergoes during contraction and relaxation. It is a measure of cardiac function, not a chemical.\n3. High-sensitive cardiac troponin T (cTnT): This is a chemical entity. cTnT is a protein found in cardiac muscle cells. When these cells are damaged, such as during a heart attack, cTnT is released into the bloodstream. High-sensitive cTnT assays can detect even small amounts of this protein, making it a useful biomarker for cardiac injury and dysfunction.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are epirubicin and high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (cTnT)."},
