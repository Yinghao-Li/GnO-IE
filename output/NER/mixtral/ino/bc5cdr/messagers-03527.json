In this paragraph, the words \"hypertrophy\" could be a potential disease entity.\n\nHypertrophy is not a disease itself, but it can be a symptom or a result of various diseases. Hypertrophy refers to the enlargement of an organ or tissue from the increase in the size of its cells. It can be a sign of various medical conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy in heart disease, skeletal muscle hypertrophy in muscular disorders, or benign prostatic hypertrophy in prostate enlargement.\n\nTherefore, in this context, \"hypertrophy\" can be considered a disease entity, although it's essential to understand that hypertrophy is not always a disease but a condition that can be associated with several medical disorders."},
