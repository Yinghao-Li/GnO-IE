Analyze the context to ensure that the identified words or phrases refer to a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two diseases mentioned:\n\n1. Myocardial infarction: Also known as a heart attack, it occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot. This can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.\n\n2. Left ventricular dysfunction: This refers to the impaired ability of the left ventricle (the heart's main pumping chamber) to pump blood efficiently to the rest of the body. It can lead to heart failure if not treated.\n\nBoth of these diseases are well-established medical conditions and are directly related to the context of the paragraph."},
