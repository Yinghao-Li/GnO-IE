Chemokines are a family of small cytokines, or signaling proteins, that are secreted by cells and affect the behavior of other cells, particularly immune cells.

In this case, CCR2 is the receptor for Chemokine CCL2.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Chemokine CCL2 and CCR2."},
