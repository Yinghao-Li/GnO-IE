Refractory mantle cell lymphoma: This is the disease entity in the paragraph. Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. In this context, \"refractory\" means that the lymphoma has not responded to previous treatments."},

Cytostatic drugs are a type of chemical substance that inhibit the growth and division of cells, including cancer cells.\n2. Anti - angiogenic: This is another chemical entity. Anti-angiogenic drugs are chemicals that prevent the growth of new blood vessels, which is a process known as angiogenesis. These drugs are often used to treat cancer, as they can help to starve tumors of the nutrients they need to grow.\n3. Temsirolimus: This is a specific chemical entity that is mentioned in the paragraph. Temsirolimus is a medication that is used to treat certain types of cancer, including mantle cell lymphoma. It is an anti-cancer drug that works by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are cytostatic, anti-angiogenic, and temsirolimus."},
