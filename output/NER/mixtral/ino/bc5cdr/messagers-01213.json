Tempol: This is a chemical compound with the formula (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxy. It is a superoxide scavenger.\n3. Arterial pressure: While not a chemical itself, arterial pressure is a measurement of the force that blood exerts on the walls of the arteries. It is affected by various chemical and physiological factors.\n4. LNNA: This is an abbreviation for NG-nitro-L-arginine, which is a chemical compound used as a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.\n5. mm Hg: This is a unit of measurement for pressure, specifically millimeters of mercury. It is used to express arterial pressure in this paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are tempol, NG-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA), and mm Hg (used as a unit of measurement for arterial pressure)."},
