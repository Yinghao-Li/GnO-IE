Analyze the context of each word or phrase to confirm if it is a disease entity.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two disease-related terms:\n\n1. Tolerance: This term is often used in the context of diseases or conditions, referring to the diminished response to a drug or other substance after repeated use. However, tolerance itself is not a disease but a condition or phenomenon associated with diseases or drug use.\n2. Catalepsy: This is a disease entity. Catalepsy is a condition characterized by a trance-like state, muscular rigidity, and decreased responsiveness to stimuli.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is catalepsy."},
