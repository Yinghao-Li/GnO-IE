They are nerve cells that carry signals from the bladder to the spinal cord.\n* NOS - IR: This stands for Nitric Oxide Synthase - Immunoreactive. It refers to the presence of a specific protein in the neurons, not a disease.\n* chronic CYP administration: This refers to the administration of a drug called CYP over a long period of time. It is not a disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},
