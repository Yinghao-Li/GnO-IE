Surrogates of long-term exposure: Although not explicitly mentioned, these surrogates likely represent measurements or estimates of exposure to chemicals or pollutants over a long period of time.\n\n3. Geocoded addresses: While not a chemical entity itself, geocoding refers to the process of assigning geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) to a specific address or location. In this context, the addresses are associated with the study participants, who are likely exposed to the predicted pollutant concentrations.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the predicted pollutant concentrations and the surrogates of long-term exposure to these pollutants."},
