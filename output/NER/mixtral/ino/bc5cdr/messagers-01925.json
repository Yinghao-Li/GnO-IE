Coronary computerized tomography angiography (CTA): While not a chemical in the traditional sense, CTA is a medical imaging technique that uses ionizing radiation to produce images of the heart and coronary arteries. The \"ionizing radiation\" used in CTA consists of X-rays, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation with a high enough energy level to ionize atoms and molecules. Therefore, we can consider \"ionizing radiation\" as a chemical entity in this context.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"cocaine\" and \"ionizing radiation.\""},
