Serum: While not a chemical itself, serum refers to the fluid part of the blood that remains after clotting, which contains various chemicals such as proteins and hormones.\n3. Prolactin: This is a chemical entity. It is a protein that is best known for its role in enabling female mammals to produce milk after giving birth.\n4. Luteinizing hormone (LH): This is another chemical entity. It is a hormone that plays a key role in sexual development and reproductive function in both males and females.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are haloperidol, serum (which contains various chemicals), prolactin, and luteinizing hormone (LH)."},
