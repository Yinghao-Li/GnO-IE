Spinal anaesthesia: It is not a disease but a medical procedure. It is a type of anesthesia that is injected into the spinal canal to numb the lower half of the body before surgery.\n2. Post-spinal block hypotension: This phrase refers to a medical condition that can occur after spinal anesthesia. Hypotension means low blood pressure. So, post-spinal block hypotension refers to the condition of low blood pressure that can occur after spinal anesthesia.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"post-spinal block hypotension\"."},
