In this context, hypercalcemic episodes refer to instances when a patient's blood calcium level becomes excessively high.\n2. Calcium values: Calcium is a chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20. In this context, it refers to the concentration of calcium ions (Ca^2+) in the blood.\n3. mmol / L (mg / dL): These are units of measurement for concentration. mmol/L stands for millimoles per liter, and mg/dL stands for milligrams per deciliter. Both are used to express the concentration of various substances, including calcium ions, in biological fluids.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypercalcemia (a condition characterized by high calcium levels)\n* Calcium (a chemical element, represented as Ca^2+ in this context)\n* mmol/L and mg/dL (units of measurement for concentration)"},
