However, in this specific paragraph, the patient's white blood cell count has returned to normal after quetiapine was discontinued. Therefore, we cannot identify any active disease entities in this paragraph.\n\nIf the paragraph mentioned that the patient had an abnormal white blood cell count, then we could consider it a disease entity. But as it stands, there is no current disease entity mentioned."},
