Oral candidiasis - this is a fungal infection of the mouth, also known as thrush.\n\nThe paragraph is discussing the rechallenge of patients who developed \"oral candidiasis\" or \"hoarseness\" with beclomethasone dipropionate. Therefore, the two disease entities in this paragraph are:\n\n1. Oral candidiasis\n2. Hoarseness\n\nHoarseness is not a disease itself, but rather a symptom of various conditions affecting the voice box (larynx) and vocal cords, such as inflammation, infection, or nerve damage. However, for the purpose of this exercise, I have identified it as a disease entity since it was mentioned in the paragraph as a condition that patients developed."},
