HIT is a condition that can occur in some people who are given heparin, a blood-thinning medication.\n3. The disease is caused by the formation of antibodies against heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4), a protein found in platelets.\n4. These antibodies can trigger the release of procoagulant platelet particles, which can lead to the formation of blood clots and potentially life-threatening complications.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)."},
