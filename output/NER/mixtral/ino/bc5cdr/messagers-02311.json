In this paragraph, there are two diseases mentioned: \"tacrolimus use\" and \"SSc\".\n3. \"Tacrolimus\" is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs, and it can also be used to treat certain autoimmune diseases. Therefore, \"tacrolimus use\" can be considered a disease entity in this context, as it refers to the administration of the drug to treat or prevent a medical condition.\n4. \"SSc\" is an abbreviation for systemic sclerosis, which is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and organs.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"tacrolimus use\" and \"SSc\"."},
