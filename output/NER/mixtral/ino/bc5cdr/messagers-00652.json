Transfusion-dependent thalassemia: This is a genetic blood disorder where the body doesn't make enough hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that allows them to carry oxygen throughout the body. Although it's not a chemical, I thought it's worth mentioning since it's a crucial part of the context.\n2. Desferrioxamine (DFX): This is a chemical entity, also known as desferal ordeferoxamine mesylate. It is an iron chelator used to remove excess iron from the body, often in patients with thalassemia who receive frequent blood transfusions.\n3. Intravenous: Although not a chemical itself, it is important to note that DFX is administered intravenously, which means it is delivered directly into a vein.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are desferrioxamine (DFX) and intravenous (in the context of DFX administration)."},
