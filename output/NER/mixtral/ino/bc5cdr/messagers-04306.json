Therefore, it is a disease entity.\n * Prinzmetal: This is actually a person's name, Prinzmetal Angina is the disease named after him. It is a rare form of angina (chest pain) caused by spasms in the coronary arteries. Therefore, it is also a disease entity.\n\nCompiling the disease entities:\n\n* Ischaemic heart disease\n* Prinzmetal Angina"},
