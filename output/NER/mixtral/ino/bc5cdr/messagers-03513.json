In this paragraph, there are no direct mentions of chemical substances or drugs by name.\n3. However, there are some medical terms that imply the use of a chemical entity (a drug).\n4. The terms \"papilledema,\" \"pseudotumor cerebri,\" and \"white or gray subepithelial corneal opacities\" are medical conditions that can be caused by certain drugs or chemicals.\n5. Since the paragraph mentions that these conditions are reversible if the drug is discontinued, it implies that a chemical entity is responsible for these adverse reactions.\n\nTherefore, the implied \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are the drugs or chemicals that can cause the adverse ocular reactions mentioned.
