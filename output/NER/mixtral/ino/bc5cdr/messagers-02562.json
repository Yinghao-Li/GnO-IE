PD: Similar to CAN, PD is likely a short form for a chemical name, possibly a drug or compound, but the paragraph does not provide enough information to make a positive identification.\n3. MDMA: This is a chemical entity, also known as ecstasy or molly. It is a psychoactive drug primarily used for recreational purposes.\n4. EX-MDMA: This term is not explicitly identified as a chemical entity in the paragraph, but it is likely a reference to a chemical compound or drug, possibly the metabolites or residues of MDMA in the body after its usage.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are CAN, PD, MDMA, and EX-MDMA.
