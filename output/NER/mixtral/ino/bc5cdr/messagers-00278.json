Research or analyze the context of these words or phrases to determine if they refer to a disease.\n\nApplying this process to the given paragraph:\n\n1. QT prolongation\n\n2. Researching \"QT prolongation\" reveals that it is a medical condition where the QT interval, a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle, is prolonged. This interval represents the time it takes for the heart's ventricles to electrically depolarize and repolarize. Prolonged QT interval can lead to ventricular arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* QT prolongation"},
