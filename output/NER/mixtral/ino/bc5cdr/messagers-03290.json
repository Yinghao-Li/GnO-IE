Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations: While not a chemical entity itself, MD simulations are a computational technique used to study the movements of atoms and molecules over time.\n2. Mutation p . Val204Asp: This is a genetic mutation where the amino acid valine (Val) at position 204 is replaced by aspartic acid (Asp).\n3. Hydrogen bonding: This is a type of weak intermolecular force that occurs when a hydrogen atom is shared between two electronegative atoms.\n4. Gln223 and Glu441: These are abbreviations for the amino acids glutamine (Gln) and glutamic acid (Glu) at positions 223 and 441, respectively.\n5. Ser198 and His438: These are abbreviations for the amino acids serine (Ser) and histidine (His) at positions 198 and 438, respectively.\n6. Catalytic triad functionality: This refers to a group of three amino acids in an enzyme that work together to catalyze a chemical reaction.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations\n* Mutation p .
