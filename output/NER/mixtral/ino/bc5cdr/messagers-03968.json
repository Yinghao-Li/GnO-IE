So, \"azathioprine\" can be identified as a disease entity in a broader sense.\n3. \"renal transplant\" - This phrase refers to a transplant surgery where a kidney from a donor is placed into a patient's body. Therefore, \"renal transplant\" can be identified as a disease entity.\n4. \"cyclosporine\" - Cyclosporine is a medication used to prevent the body from rejecting transplanted organs, and it can be used to treat diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and nephrotic syndrome. So, \"cyclosporine\" can be identified as a disease entity in a broader sense.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"renal,\" \"azathioprine,\" \"renal transplant,\" and \"cyclosporine.\""},
