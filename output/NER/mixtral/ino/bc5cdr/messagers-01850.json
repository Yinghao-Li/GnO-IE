There is no mention of any specific disease in the paragraph, but there are two medical conditions or symptoms mentioned:\n   - \"Increased vulnerability to 6 - hydroxydopamine lesion\" - This is a condition where there is increased sensitivity to the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, which is used in scientific research to selectively destroy certain types of nerve cells.\n   - \"Reduced development of dyskinesias\" - Dyskinesias are a type of movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle movements.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"6 - hydroxydopamine lesion\" and \"dyskinesias\". However, it's important to note that these are not diseases themselves, but rather conditions or symptoms that can be associated with various diseases."},

The paragraph does not actually mention any diseases.\n\nThe \"6 - hydroxydopamine lesion\" is not a disease, but rather a laboratory technique used to create a model of a disease. Similarly, \"dyskinesias\" are a symptom or a side effect of certain diseases, but they are not diseases themselves.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph that clearly refer to a disease."},
