It is a chemical compound with the formula (C8H9NO2). Therefore, Acetaminophen is a chemical.\n* Hepatotoxicity: It refers to harmful effects of chemical substances on the liver. It is not a chemical but a condition or adverse effect caused by chemicals.\n* Acute liver failure (ALF): It is a serious condition where the liver suddenly loses its function. It can be caused by various factors, including chemical substances. However, ALF is not a chemical but a medical condition.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"Acetaminophen.\""},
