Dry air: Although dry air is not a specific chemical compound, it is mentioned in the context of having controlled temperature, humidity, and flow rate. Therefore, it can be considered a chemical entity.\n3. Controlled temperature: While temperature is not a chemical entity, it is mentioned in the context of being controlled for the dry air. Therefore, it is not a chemical entity.\n4. 0 % relative humidity: This is a chemical entity. Relative humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air, and 0% indicates that there is no water vapor present.\n5. 22 degrees C: This is not a chemical entity. It is a temperature measurement.\n6. 145 ml . s - 1 : This is not a chemical entity. It is a flow rate measurement.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are CO2 and 0 % relative humidity."},
