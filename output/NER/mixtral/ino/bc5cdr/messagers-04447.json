Alkali: An alkali is a basic, ionic compound that can neutralize acids and turn litmus paper blue.\n3. 1, 25 (OH)2D: This is a chemical entity, specifically a form of vitamin D, also known as calcitriol, which is a secosteroid hormone that is crucial for the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body.\n4. Hypoparathyroidism: This is a medical condition, not a chemical, but it is worth mentioning as it is relevant to the context of the paragraph. Hypoparathyroidism is a disorder characterized by insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone, which can lead to problems with calcium and phosphate regulation in the body."},
