The study found that both the clozapine-treated group and the olanzapine-treated group had significant insulin resistance compared to the risperidone-treated group.\n3. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body's cells become resistant to the effects of insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. It is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes.\n4. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n * Insulin resistance\n * Type 2 diabetes (implied)"},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "* Insulin resistance\n* Type 2 diabetes (implied)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The paragraph mentions \"insulin resistance,\" which is a well-defined medical condition and a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Therefore, \"insulin resistance\" is a clear reference to a disease.\n* The paragraph also implies \"type 2 diabetes\" as a related disease since insulin resistance is a risk factor for developing it. However, the term \"type 2 diabetes\" is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, so it is an implied reference to a disease.\n* Other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"clozapine,\" \"olanzapine,\" and \"risperidone,\" are medications used to treat various mental health disorders, not diseases themselves. Therefore, they are not relevant entities in the context of identifying diseases."},
