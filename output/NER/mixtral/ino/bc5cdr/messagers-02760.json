The paragraph discusses the effects of pre-treatment with propofol in intralipid or medialipid on bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxic effects. Cardiotoxic effects refer to harmful or toxic effects on the heart muscle or function, but it is not a disease itself. Plasma bupivacaine levels refer to the concentration of the local anesthetic drug bupivacaine in the blood, not a disease. Therefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},
