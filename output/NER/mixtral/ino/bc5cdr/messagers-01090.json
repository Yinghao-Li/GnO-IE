The phrase is directly mentioned as the most common type of damage.\n2. It is associated with an inverse correlation with age and worse outcome.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that \"hepatocellular pattern of damage\" refers to a disease or a specific condition.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that \"hepatocellular pattern of damage\" is a type of liver injury or damage rather than a named disease. Nonetheless, since the task is to identify disease entities, we can list \"hepatocellular pattern of damage\" as a disease entity in this context."},
