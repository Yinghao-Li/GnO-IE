The text discusses the effects of certain substances (propranolol and B 24/76) on the myosin isoenzyme pattern of a hypertrophied rat heart, but it does not explicitly mention any diseases.\n\nIf we consider 'hypertrophied' as a potential disease-related term, it generally refers to an enlargement of an organ or tissue due to an increase in the size of its cells. However, hypertrophy itself is not a disease but a condition that can be associated with various diseases, such as cardiac hypertrophy in heart disease.\n\nTherefore, the only disease-related term in this paragraph is 'hypertrophied rat heart,' which implies a heart with hypertrophy, possibly due to an underlying disease."},

Myosin isoenzyme pattern: While not a chemical itself, myosin is a protein that plays a crucial role in muscle contraction. Isoenzymes are different forms of an enzyme that catalyze the same reaction but differ in amino acid sequence. Therefore, myosin isoenzyme pattern refers to the different forms of myosin present in a sample.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are propranolol and B 24 / 76."},
