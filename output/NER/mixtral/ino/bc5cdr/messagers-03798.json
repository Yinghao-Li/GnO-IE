It is mentioned in the paragraph as \"increased incidence and severity of hematuria.\"\n2. Increased serum creatinine: Creatinine is a waste product that's produced by your normal muscle metabolism. The kidneys filter out most of the creatinine and dispose of it in your urine. However, when the kidneys are damaged or not functioning properly, creatinine can build up in the blood. In this paragraph, \"increased serum creatinine\" is mentioned as evidence of renal damage in aspirin-treated jj rats.\n3. Increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions: Histopathologic lesions refer to abnormalities in tissue structure that can be seen under a microscope. In this case, the lesions are located in the outer medullary region of the kidney. The presence of these lesions is another indication of renal damage in aspirin-treated jj rats.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Hematuria, Increased serum creatinine, and Increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions."},
