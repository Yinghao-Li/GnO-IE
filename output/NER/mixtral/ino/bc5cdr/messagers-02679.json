    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. PELD: PELD stands for Pediatric End-stage Liver Disease, which is a scoring system used to assess the severity of liver disease in children and prioritize them for liver transplantation. However, in this context, it is being used as a \"risk factor\" and not as a \"chemical\" entity.\n2. Child - Pugh scores: The Child-Pugh score is a method used to assess the prognosis of chronic liver disease. It is based on the patient's serum bilirubin, serum albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. In this context, it is being used as a \"risk factor\" and not as a \"chemical\" entity.\n3. LT: LT stands for Liver Transplantation, which is a surgical procedure to replace a diseased liver with a healthy one from a donor. It is not a \"chemical\" entity.\n4. Post-operative serum Tbil: Tbil is a shorthand for total bilirubin, which is a yellow pigment found in bile, a fluid produced by the liver. High levels of bilirubin in the blood can cause jaundice. In this context, it is being used as a \"risk factor\" and not as a \"chemical\" entity.\n5. TAC: TAC stands for Tacrolimus, which is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs.
