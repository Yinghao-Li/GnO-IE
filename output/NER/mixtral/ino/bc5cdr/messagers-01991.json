It is a form of cocaine that has been processed to make it smokable.\n\nThere are no other chemical entities explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. However, it is worth noting that the paragraph discusses the \"risk of HIV seroconversion\" among participants who smoke crack cocaine. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a retrovirus that attacks the immune system and can lead to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). It is not a chemical entity itself, but it is relevant to the discussion of the health risks associated with crack cocaine use."},
