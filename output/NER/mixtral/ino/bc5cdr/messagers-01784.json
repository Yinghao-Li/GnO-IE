Analyze each one to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nHere are the potential chemical entities found in the paragraph:\n\n1. Propofol\n2. Remifentanil\n3. TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia)\n\nNow, let's analyze each one:\n\n1. Propofol: It is a short-acting medication used for inducing and maintaining anesthesia. It is a chemical compound, 2,6-diisopropylphenol, and is classified as an alkylphenol.\n2. Remifentanil: It is a potent opioid analgesic drug used for sedation and anesthesia during surgery. It is a chemical compound, 4-[(1R,13R,15S)-15-(trifluoromethyl)-1-phenylpentan-13-yl]-3-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, and is classified as a synthetic opioid.\n3. TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia): It is a type of anesthesia that uses only intravenous drugs to induce and maintain anesthesia. Although TIVA is not a chemical itself, it involves the use of intravenous drugs, such as propofol and remifentanil, which are chemical entities.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are Propofol and Remifentanil."},
