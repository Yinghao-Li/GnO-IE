Refractory MCL: \"Refractory\" is a term used to describe a disease or condition that does not respond to treatment, and \"MCL\" stands for Mantle Cell Lymphoma, which is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. Therefore, \"refractory MCL\" can be considered a disease entity.\n2. Temsirolimus: While not a disease, temsirolimus is a medication used to treat certain types of cancer, including refractory MCL.\n3. Tumor: In the context of this paragraph, \"tumor\" refers to the abnormal growth of cells, which is a characteristic of cancer. Therefore, \"tumor\" can be considered a disease entity.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are refractory MCL and tumor."},
