It is a type of seizure disorder.\n * Accidental intravascular injection: While not a disease itself, it can lead to medical complications such as toxicity or embolism, depending on the substance injected.\n * Levobupivacaine: This is a local anesthetic used in medical procedures. Accidental intravascular injection of this drug can lead to toxicity and related symptoms, such as seizures.\n3. Compiling the list of disease entities:\n * Seizure disorder, specifically grand mal seizures\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Seizure disorder, specifically grand mal seizures"},
