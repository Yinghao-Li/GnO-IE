Analyze the context to ensure that the identified words or phrases indeed refer to diseases.\n\nIn the paragraph you provided, there are two potential disease entities:\n\n1. Antiarrhythmic activity: While this is not a disease itself, it refers to the therapeutic effect of a drug or treatment to restore normal heart rhythms. It is related to heart conditions or arrhythmias, which can be considered diseases.\n2. Ventricular tachycardia: This is a specific type of arrhythmia, which is a heart condition characterized by an irregular heartbeat.\n\nSince the context is about the therapeutic effects of ACC - 9653 and phenytoin sodium against ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia in anesthetized dogs, both antiarrhythmic activity and ventricular tachycardia are related to heart conditions or diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
