Relapsed or refractory HL: HL stands for Hodgkin Lymphoma, a type of cancer. The terms \"relapsed\" and \"refractory\" suggest that the cancer has not responded to previous treatment or has returned after a period of remission. While not a chemical entity itself, HL is often treated with various chemical agents, including chemotherapy drugs.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are GEM - P (an unspecified chemotherapy drug) and chemotherapy (a treatment that involves the use of chemicals to destroy living cells)."},
