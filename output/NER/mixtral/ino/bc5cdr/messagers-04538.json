(intravenous)\n\nStep 2:\n\n* Human corticotropin - releasing hormone (hCRH): This is a chemical entity, as it is a specific hormone released by the hypothalamus that stimulates the release of corticotropin from the pituitary gland.\n* thyrotropin - releasing hormone (TRH): This is also a chemical entity, as it is a hormone released by the hypothalamus that stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland.\n* i.v. (intravenous): This is an abbreviation for a medical administration technique, not a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are human corticotropin - releasing hormone (hCRH) and thyrotropin - releasing hormone (TRH)."},
