It is a protein molecule made up of four subunits, two alpha chains and two beta chains, each containing a heme group with an iron atom in the center. The iron atom can bind to one molecule of oxygen, allowing hemoglobin to transport oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues.\n\nHemoglobin content in the paragraph refers to the measurement of the amount of hemoglobin present in the F1 hybrid tumors.\n\nTherefore, \"hemoglobin\" is the chemical entity in the paragraph.\n\nThere are no other chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
