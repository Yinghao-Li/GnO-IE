It follows a typical diurnal rhythm or profile, with levels peaking in the early morning and declining throughout the day.\n2.

In this context, it is used to describe the elevated cortisol levels that some participants had prior to sleeping.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are cortisol and, indirectly, the term \"pre-bed\" which refers to the time before going to bed and is associated with the elevated cortisol levels."},
