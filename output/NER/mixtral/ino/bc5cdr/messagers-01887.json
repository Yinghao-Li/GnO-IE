In the given paragraph, the potential medical conditions are:\n   - Intradialytic support of liver transplantation\n   - Fulminant liver failure\n4. After analyzing the context, we can confirm that both terms are used as diseases:\n   - Liver transplantation refers to the medical procedure for replacing a diseased liver with a healthy one.\n   - Fulminant liver failure is a severe form of liver failure that develops rapidly, typically over a few days.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n1.
