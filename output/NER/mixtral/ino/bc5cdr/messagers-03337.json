Complex I: This is a protein complex involved in the electron transport chain in the process of cellular respiration. Although it is composed of proteins and not a pure chemical, it is often referred to as a chemical in biochemistry.\n2. Aconitase: This is an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle. Similar to Complex I, aconitase is also a protein and not a pure chemical, but it is often referred to as a chemical in biochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Complex I and aconitase."},
