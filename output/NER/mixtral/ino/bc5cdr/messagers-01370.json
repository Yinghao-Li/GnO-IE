The text mentions that Quinine has an \"anti-arrhythmic property,\" which means it can help regulate abnormal heart rhythms.\n3. However, it also mentions that Quinine can have a \"pro-arrhythmic\" effect, which means it can cause abnormal heart rhythms or make existing ones worse.\n4. Specifically, it can cause various arrhythmias, including a severe type called \"multiple PVC.\"\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Arrhythmias\n* Severe arrhythmia\n* Multiple PVC (premature ventricular contractions)"},
