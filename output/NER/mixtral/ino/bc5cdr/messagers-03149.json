Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph, the potential disease-related words/phrases are:\n\n* selective vulnerability\n* ethambutol toxicity\n* anterior visual pathways\n* peripheral nerves\n\nNow, let's analyze the context of each word/phrase:\n\n1. selective vulnerability - This term refers to the susceptibility of certain parts of the body to damage or disease. It is not a disease itself, but a characteristic of a disease.\n2. ethambutol toxicity - Ethambutol is a medication used to treat tuberculosis. Toxicity refers to the harmful or poisonous effect of a substance. Therefore, ethambutol toxicity is a condition caused by the adverse effects of the medication on the body.\n3. anterior visual pathways - This term refers to the nerve fibers that transmit visual information from the eye to the brain. Damage to these pathways can lead to visual impairment or loss. Although not a disease per se, damage to the anterior visual pathways can be a symptom or consequence of various diseases.\n4. peripheral nerves - These are the nerves that transmit signals between the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and the rest of the body. Damage to peripheral nerves can result in various neurological symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness. Peripheral neuropathy is the term used to describe damage to the peripheral nerves.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. ethambutol toxicity\n2. (potentially) peripheral neuropathy (if damage to peripheral nerves is significant)"},
