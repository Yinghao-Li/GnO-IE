Quinine amblyopia is a condition characterized by visual impairment or blindness, typically in both eyes, caused by the use of quinine. Quinine is a medication used to treat malaria, and quinine amblyopia is a potential side effect of its use.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"quinine amblyopia\" and \"pupil and visual-evoked potential abnormalities\" (although the latter is a general description of a symptom rather than a specific disease)."},
