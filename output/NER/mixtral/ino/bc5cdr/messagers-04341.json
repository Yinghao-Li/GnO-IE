Sensitization to cephalothin indicates an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to the drug, which can be considered a type of adverse effect or medical condition, but not a disease itself.\n* Ampicillin: Similar to cephalothin, ampicillin is also an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. Sensitization to ampicillin indicates an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to the drug, which can be considered a type of adverse effect or medical condition, but not a disease itself.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are: None. The text discusses allergic reactions or sensitivities to antibiotics, but it does not mention any specific diseases."},
