Iodinated contrast media are commonly used in medical imaging procedures to improve the visibility of internal body structures.\n\nThere are no other explicit chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph.

While these terms are not chemicals themselves, they are closely related to the administration of iodinated contrast media and the potential for renal dysfunction as a side effect."},
