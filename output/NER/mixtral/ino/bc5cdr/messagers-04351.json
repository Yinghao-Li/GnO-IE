Analyze the context of each term to determine if it is being used to describe a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are no terms that explicitly refer to a disease. However, there are a few terms that are related to medical conditions:\n\n* Arterial blood pressure (MAP): While not a disease itself, high blood pressure (hypertension) is a significant medical condition. In this context, MAP likely refers to mean arterial pressure, which is a measure of the average pressure in the arteries during a single cardiac cycle.\n* Normotensive (WKY): WKY is an abbreviation for Wistar-Kyoto rats, a strain of rats that are often used as a control group in hypertension research because they have normal blood pressure.\n* Spontaneously hypertensive (SHR): SHR is a strain of rats that develop high blood pressure spontaneously, without any experimental intervention.\n\nBased on this analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypertension\n* Normal blood pressure (implied by the use of Wistar-Kyoto rats as a control group)"},

So, in this context, \"MAP\" can be considered a chemical entity.\n4. heart rate (HR) - like blood pressure, heart rate is not a chemical, but it is a measure of the number of times the heart beats per minute, and can be affected by various chemicals in the body.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are arginine vasopressin (AVP), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), arterial blood pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR)."},
