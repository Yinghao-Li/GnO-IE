Carcinoma is a type of cancer, and in this context, it is invasive, meaning it has spread to surrounding tissues. \"Clinically occult\" means it was not detected during clinical evaluation, but it was found in the pathology specimen.\n* renal pelvis: This is not a disease itself but a part of the urinary system, specifically the upper part of the ureter within the kidney where urine collects before flowing into the ureter. However, diseases can affect the renal pelvis, such as cancers or infections.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis"},
