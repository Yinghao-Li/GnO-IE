Research each term to determine if it is a disease.\n\nCardiomyocyte degeneration: This refers to the deterioration of the cardiomyocytes, which are the muscle cells of the heart. It is not a specific disease, but rather a pathological process that can be a feature of various heart conditions.\n\nHypertrophy / cytomegaly: Hypertrophy is an increase in the size of an organ or tissue due to an increase in the size of its cells. Cytomegaly is an enlargement of a cell due to an increase in the size of the cell's cytoplasm. Both hypertrophy and cytomegaly can be symptoms of various diseases, but they are not specific diseases themselves.\n\nExtensive vacuolation: Vacuolation refers to the presence of vacuoles (small, fluid-filled spaces) within cells. It can be a feature of various diseases, but it is not a specific disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph. Instead, there are pathological processes and cellular changes that can be associated with various heart conditions."},
