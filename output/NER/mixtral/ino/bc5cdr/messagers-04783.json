Research or analyze the context of these words or phrases to determine if they refer to a specific disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential disease-related words or phrases are:\n\n* \"Glibenclamide-sensitive hypotension\"\n* \"helodermin\"\n\nLet's analyze these terms:\n\n1. Glibenclamide: It is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, can be a side effect of Glibenclamide. In this context, \"Glibenclamide-sensitive hypotension\" refers to a state of low blood pressure that is caused by or sensitive to Glibenclamide.\n2. Helodermin: It is a toxin found in the saliva of the Gila monster, a type of lizard. According to the context, it seems to be the agent causing the hypotension. However, it is not a disease itself.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is \"hypotension,\" which is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood pressure."},
