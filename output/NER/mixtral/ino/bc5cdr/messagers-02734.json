The abbreviation \"CNS\" stands for \"central nervous system,\" and \"leukemia\" is a type of cancer. So, \"CNS leukemia\" is also a chemical entity.\n3. The term \"Pediatric Oncology Group\" is not a chemical entity, but rather an organization that focuses on the treatment of cancer in children.\n4. The term \"institutions\" is not a chemical entity, but rather refers to places where research or education is conducted.\n5. The term \"diagnosis\" is not a chemical entity, but rather refers to the identification of a disease or condition.\n6. The term \"P9201\" and \"P9605\" are not chemical entities, but rather they are likely the names or codes of specific clinical trials or studies.\n7. The term \"years\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a unit of time.\n8. The term \"standard-risk\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a term used to describe the likelihood of a patient's cancer recurring.\n9. The term \"chemotherapy\" is not in the paragraph but it is a chemical entity, it is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to destroy cancer cells.\n10. The term \"ACCL0131\" is not a chemical entity, but rather the name or code of a specific clinical trial or study.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"acute lymphoblastic leukemia\" and \"CNS leukemia\"."},
