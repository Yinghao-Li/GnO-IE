It is a \"chemical\" entity as it is a synthetic compound with a specific chemical structure and formula.\n2. Myxoedema coma: This is a rare but life-threatening complication of hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. While \"myxoedema\" refers to the swelling and thickening of the skin due to hypothyroidism, \"coma\" refers to a state of deep unconsciousness. Therefore, myxoedema coma is not a chemical entity, but a medical condition caused by the lack of thyroid hormones.\n3. Thyroid hormones: These are hormones produced by the thyroid gland that regulate the body's metabolism and energy levels. Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are the two main thyroid hormones. As hormones, they are chemical entities, specifically, they are amine hormones derived from the amino acid tyrosine.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are amiodarone and thyroid hormones."},
