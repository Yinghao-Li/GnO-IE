Therefore, it's not considered a disease entity in this context.\n* negative emotional states - This term is too broad and does not specifically refer to a recognized disease.\n* depressive symptoms - Depressive symptoms are indicative of various mental health disorders, such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. In this context, it is referring to a specific aspect of certain diseases, not the disease itself.\n\nTherefore, there is no clear \"Disease\" entity in the provided paragraph."},

While not a specific chemical, it is a system that is related to the action of chemicals in the body, so I have included it for completeness.\n3. Depressive symptoms: These are a set of symptoms associated with depression, which can include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities. While not a chemical entity itself, it is a condition that can be caused by the disruption of chemical systems in the body, such as those caused by methamphetamine abuse."},
