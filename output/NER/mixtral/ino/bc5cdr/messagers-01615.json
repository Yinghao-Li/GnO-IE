The potential disease-related words/phrases are:\n * \"cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis\"\n2. Researching or examining the context of \"cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis\":\n * Cyclophosphamide is a medication used to treat various cancers and autoimmune diseases.\n * A common side effect of cyclophosphamide is cystitis, which is inflammation of the bladder.\n * In this context, \"cyclophosphosphamide-induced cystitis\" refers to the bladder inflammation caused by the administration of cyclophosphamide.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Cystitis (induced by cyclophosphamide)"},
