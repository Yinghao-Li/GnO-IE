Analyze the context to ensure that the identified words or phrases indeed refer to diseases.\n3. The paragraph mentions three potential medical conditions: hyperglycemia, an elevated glucose tolerance curve, and glucosuria.\n4. Hyperglycemia is a disease or medical condition characterized by an abnormally high level of glucose in the blood.\n5. An elevated glucose tolerance curve is not a disease itself but a sign or symptom of an underlying medical condition, typically hyperglycemia or diabetes.\n6. Glucosuria is a medical condition where an abnormal amount of glucose is present in the urine.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hyperglycemia\n2. Glucosuria (although it is a symptom, it is mentioned separately and can be a condition on its own)"},
