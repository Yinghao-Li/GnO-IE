It is a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is also known as acetylsalicylic acid.\n\nIn the given paragraph, \"aspirin\" is explicitly mentioned as a medication that is associated with the risk of ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease). Therefore, \"aspirin\" is the chemical entity in this paragraph.\n\n2. ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease): While not a chemical in the traditional sense, ESRD is a medical condition that is caused by the failure of the kidneys to function properly. It is often the result of long-term damage to the kidneys, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including the use of certain medications like aspirin.\n\n3. Vascular nephropathy: This is a medical term that refers to kidney disease that is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the kidneys. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a type of kidney disease that can increase the risk of ESRD.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the given paragraph are \"aspirin\" and \"ESRD\"."},
