Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT): This is a disease or condition that occurs when a patient develops a decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and blood clots (thrombosis) after being administered heparin, a type of blood thinner.\n3. Thrombocytopenia: This is a condition where the patient has a lower than normal number of platelets in their blood.\n4. Thrombosis: This is a disease or condition where a blood clot forms inside a blood vessel, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system.\n5. Alteplase: This is a medication used for thrombolysis, or the breaking up of blood clots, but it is not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT)\n* Thrombocytopenia\n* Thrombosis"},
