Therefore, \"Amiodarone-related pulmonary mass\" is a disease entity.\n2. Unique membranous glomerulonephritis: This is a kidney disease, specifically a type of glomerulonephritis, which is inflammation of the glomeruli or filtering units of the kidney. Therefore, \"unique membranous glomerulonephritis\" is a disease entity.\n3. Valvular heart disease: This is a general term for various conditions that affect the heart valves, which are important for directing blood flow through the heart. Therefore, \"valvular heart disease\" is a disease entity.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"Amiodarone-related pulmonary mass,\" \"unique membranous glomerulonephritis,\" and \"valvular heart disease.\""},
