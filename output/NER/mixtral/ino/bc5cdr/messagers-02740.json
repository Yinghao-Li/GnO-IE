Generalized seizure: A seizure is a symptom of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, and can be caused by various factors, including chemical imbalances.\n4. Renal failure: This is a medical condition in which the kidneys are no longer able to remove waste and excess water from the blood at a normal rate. While not a chemical itself, it is a condition that can be caused by various chemical imbalances or toxicities.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Tranexamic acid and the implied chemical imbalances or toxicities that can lead to overdosage, seizures, and renal failure."},
