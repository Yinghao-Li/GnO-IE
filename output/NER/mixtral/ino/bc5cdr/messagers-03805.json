Analyze each potential chemical entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text:\n\n* Plasma\n* Lidocaine\n* Beta - blocking agents\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each potential chemical entity:\n\n1. Plasma: Plasma is a bodily fluid, not a chemical.\n2. Lidocaine: Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and an antiarrhythmic drug, hence it is a chemical.\n3. Beta - blocking agents: Beta-blockers are a class of medications that are primarily used to treat cardiovascular diseases, and they work by blocking the action of certain hormones on the heart and blood vessels. Since they are a class of drugs, they are considered chemicals.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* Lidocaine\n* Beta-blocking agents"},

It is a category of pharmaceuticals that have similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, it is not considered a chemical entity in this context."},
