Eosinophilia: It is a condition characterized by an abnormally high number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the blood.\n5. Skin reactions: These are adverse effects on the skin that can occur as a result of using heparin.\n6. Allergic reactions: These are adverse effects that occur when the immune system reacts to heparin.\n7.
