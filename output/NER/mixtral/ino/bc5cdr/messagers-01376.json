Zinc acetate: This is a chemical compound that is used as a dietary supplement and as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of certain medical conditions, such as Wilson's disease.\n2. Wilson's disease: This is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize copper, leading to the accumulation of copper in various organs. It is not a chemical, but a medical condition.\n3. Penicillamine: This is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat various medical conditions, including Wilson's disease. It is a chelating agent that binds to heavy metals, such as copper, and helps remove them from the body.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are zinc acetate and penicillamine."},
