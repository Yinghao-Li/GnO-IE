Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are no specific disease names mentioned. However, there are two medical terms related to conditions or sensations that could be considered \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. Secondary hyperalgesia - This is a condition characterized by increased sensitivity to pain in response to a painful stimulus. It is not a disease in the traditional sense, but rather a symptom or condition related to pain perception.\n2. Allodynia - This is a condition where normally non-painful stimuli are perceived as painful. Like secondary hyperalgesia, it is not a disease but a symptom or condition related to pain perception.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Secondary hyperalgesia\n2. Allodynia"},
