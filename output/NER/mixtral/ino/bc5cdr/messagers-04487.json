The text discusses a study on the effects of CD - 832 on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemia in dogs with partial coronary stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery, comparing the results with those for nifedipine or diltiazem. However, these terms are not diseases themselves but rather describe conditions, substances, or procedures related to a disease.\n\n- Myocardial ischemia: This term refers to a condition where blood flow to the heart muscle is restricted, often due to coronary artery disease. However, in this context, it is not explicitly stated that the dogs have coronary artery disease.\n\nTherefore, the only potential disease-related term in this paragraph is \"myocardial ischemia,\" but it is not explicitly stated as a disease in this context."},
