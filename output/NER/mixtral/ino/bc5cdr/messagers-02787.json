A decrease in GLS could indicate cardiac dysfunction or cardiotoxicity.\n* \"Later cardiotoxicity\" refers to a potential adverse effect of chemotherapy on the heart, which can lead to heart failure or other cardiac issues.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cardiotoxicity\n2. Cardiac dysfunction or heart failure (implied by the context of cardiotoxicity)"},
