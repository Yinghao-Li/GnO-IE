In this paragraph, there are no specific chemical compounds, drugs, or substances mentioned.\n3. However, there are two medical conditions mentioned that are related to chemicals or drugs: side-effects, pain, and myoclonia.\n4. Side-effects are typically associated with the use of chemicals or drugs. Pain can be a symptom caused by various chemicals or drugs. Myoclonia is a condition characterized by quick involuntary muscle jerks, which can be a side-effect of certain medications.\n5. Although not explicitly mentioned, these medical conditions are closely related to the use of chemicals or drugs, and thus can be considered as chemical entities in this context.\n\nTo summarize, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Side-effects\n* Pain\n* Myoclonia (implicitly related to drugs or chemicals)"},

However, upon further consideration, pain and myoclonia are not chemical entities themselves, but rather symptoms or conditions that can be caused by chemicals or drugs.\n3. Side-effects, in this context, can refer to both physical and chemical effects, but it is not a specific chemical entity.\n4. In this paragraph, there are no clear and specific chemical entities mentioned.\n\nTherefore, after removing irrelevant entities, there are no clear chemical entities in the paragraph."},
