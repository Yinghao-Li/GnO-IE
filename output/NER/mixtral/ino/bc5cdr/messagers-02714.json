    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. GFAP: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a type of intermediate filament protein that is expressed in astrocytes, a type of neural cell in the central nervous system.\n2. CD11b: CD11b is a protein that is a component of the complement receptor 3 (CR3) and is found on the surface of many different types of immune cells, including macrophages and microglia.\n3. TNF-a: TNF-a (tumor necrosis factor alpha) is a cytokine that is involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute phase reaction.\n4. ROS: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen. Examples include peroxides, superoxide, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. ROS are formed as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signaling and homeostasis.\n5. Nitrite: Nitrite is a chemical ion with the formula NO2−. In chemistry, nitrite is an intermediate in the industrial synthesis of nitric acid, millions of tons of which are produced each year. Nitrite is also a common ingredient in food preservatives and serves as a vasodilator.\n\nAll of these entities are chemical in nature, some are protein, cytokines, and ions."},
