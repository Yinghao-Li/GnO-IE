Analyze the context to ensure they are being used as chemicals.\n\nStep 1: In the given paragraph, the potential chemical entities are:\n\n* Clonidine\n* Verapamil\n\nStep 2: Researching these two substances, we find that:\n\n* Clonidine (chemical formula: C9H12Cl2N2) is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and certain types of pain.\n* Verapamil (chemical formula: C23H28Cl2N2O4) is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing the context, we can confirm that both 'clonidine' and 'verapamil' are indeed being used as chemicals (medications) in the paragraph."},
