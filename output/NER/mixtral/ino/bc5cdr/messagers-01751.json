Muscle cells contain a protein called actin, which helps them contract and relax. Nerve cells, on the other hand, contain a chemical called neurotransmitters, which allow them to communicate with each other. Blood cells contain a chemical called hemoglobin, which helps them carry oxygen throughout the body.\n\nIn this paragraph, the chemical entities are:\n\n* actin (a protein found in muscle cells)\n* neurotransmitters (chemicals found in nerve cells)\n* hemoglobin (a chemical found in blood cells)\n\nThese entities are all specific chemical substances that have unique structures and functions in the body."},
