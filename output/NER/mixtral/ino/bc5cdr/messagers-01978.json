Smoking: Although not a chemical in the traditional sense, smoking is often considered a chemical process as it involves the burning of a substance and inhaling the resulting smoke.\n2. Crack cocaine: This is a chemical compound, a form of cocaine that has been processed to make it smokable.\n3. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus): While not a chemical itself, HIV is a retrovirus, a type of virus that uses RNA as its genetic material and requires a reverse transcriptase enzyme to convert its RNA into DNA, which can then be integrated into the host cell's genome.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are smoking (as a chemical process) and crack cocaine (a chemical compound)."},
