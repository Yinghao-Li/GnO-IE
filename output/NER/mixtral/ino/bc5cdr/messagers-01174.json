    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. QT prolongation\n\nWhile QT prolongation is a condition rather than a disease, it is still often classified as a \"disease entity\" in the context of medical literature. QT prolongation refers to a delay in the time it takes for the heart's ventricles to repolarize, which can lead to dangerous heart rhythms.\n\nTherefore, \"QT prolongation\" is the disease entity in the given paragraph.\n\n2. Bradycardia\n\nBradycardia is a condition where the heart rate is slower than normal, typically defined as less than 60 beats per minute in adults. While it is not a disease per se, it can be a symptom or a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as heart disease or electrolyte imbalances.\n\nTherefore, \"bradycardia\" can be considered a disease entity in the given paragraph.\n\n3. Dizziness and general fatigue\n\nDizziness and general fatigue are symptoms rather than diseases. They can be associated with various medical conditions, including cardiovascular, neurological, or metabolic disorders.\n\nTherefore, \"dizziness\" and \"general fatigue\" are not disease entities in the given paragraph."},
