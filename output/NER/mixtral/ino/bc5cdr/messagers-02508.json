Analyze the context of each term to determine if it is being used to refer to a disease or medical condition.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there is only one potential medical condition or health-related term:\n\n* long-lasting depressive phenotype\n\nLet's analyze the context:\n\n1. The term \"long-lasting depressive phenotype\" is used in the context of discussing the effects of a toxin (acute toxic dosage of METH).\n2. A \"depressive phenotype\" generally refers to a set of observable characteristics related to depression.\n3. The term \"long-lasting\" suggests a chronic or persistent condition.\n\nBased on this analysis, \"long-lasting depressive phenotype\" can be identified as a disease entity in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: long-lasting depressive phenotype"},
