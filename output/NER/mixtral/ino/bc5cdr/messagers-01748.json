It is often associated with various medical conditions, such as infections, brain disorders, or substance intoxication or withdrawal. In this context, delirium is clearly being used as a disease or medical condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in this paragraph is:\n\n1. Delirium"},

The mention of misoprostol is a reference to a medication, not a disease. Similarly, the reference to her mental status returning to normal is a description of a symptom improvement, not a disease itself. Therefore, only \"Delirium\" is the relevant disease entity in this paragraph."},
