Research each word or phrase to determine if it is a recognized disease.\n\nIn the present study, the role of glial activation and post synaptic toxicity in ICV Streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impaired rats was explored.\n\nApplying the steps to the paragraph:\n\n1. The potential disease-related words or phrases in the paragraph are:\n * Glial activation\n * Post synaptic toxicity\n * Memory impairment\n * ICV Streptozotocin (STZ)\n2. Researching each word or phrase:\n * Glial activation: This is not a disease but a biological process where glial cells (supporting cells in the nervous system) become activated in response to injury or disease.\n * Post synaptic toxicity: This is not a disease but a condition where there is damage to the post-synaptic region of a neuron, which can lead to impaired communication between neurons.\n * Memory impairment: This is a symptom or condition characterized by a decrease in memory function, which can be caused by various diseases or conditions.\n * ICV Streptozotocin (STZ): Streptozotocin is a chemical used in research to induce diabetes in laboratory animals. ICV stands for Intracerebroventricular, which means it is administered directly into the brain ventricles. The administration of STZ in this way can lead to memory impairment, but it is not a disease itself.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are: Memory impairment."},

ICV Streptozotocin (STZ): ICV stands for intracerebroventricular, which means that the drug is administered directly into the brain's ventricular system.
