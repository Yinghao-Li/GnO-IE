Potential disease-related words or phrases: heart disease, chronic cocaine use, resting and exercise electrocardiography (ECG), Doppler echocardiography.\n2. Narrowing down to specific medical conditions: heart disease. Although chronic cocaine use is not a disease itself, it is a risk factor or a condition that can lead to health issues.
