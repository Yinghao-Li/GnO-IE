Research the substance: According to medical sources, gentamicin is an antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is not a disease itself, but its administration can lead to certain medical conditions, such as kidney damage or hearing loss, if used improperly or for an extended period of time.\n4. Identify the \"Disease\" entities: Although the paragraph does not explicitly mention any diseases, the potential adverse effects of gentamicin on the kidneys and hearing suggest that these could be considered the \"Disease\" entities in this context. However, it is important to note that the paragraph does not provide enough information to confirm whether any of the rats actually developed these conditions."},
