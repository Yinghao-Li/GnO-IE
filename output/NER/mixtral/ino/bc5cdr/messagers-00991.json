It is considered a disease entity.\n* edema: Edema is a medical condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of fluid in the body's tissues. It is considered a disease entity.\n* vasogenic edema: This is a specific type of edema that occurs due to increased permeability of blood vessels, often resulting from trauma or inflammation. It is considered a disease entity.\n\nDisease entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. Brain injury\n2. Edema\n3. Vasogenic edema"},

Edema is the medical term for swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in your body's tissues.\n* vasogenic edema: It is a chemical entity. Vasogenic edema is a type of edema caused by increased permeability of blood vessels.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"edema\" and \"vasogenic edema\"."},
