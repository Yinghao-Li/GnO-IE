Diterpenoid: This is a type of terpenoid, which is a large and diverse class of naturally occurring organic chemicals derived from terpenes. Diterpenoids are a subclass of terpenoids that contain 20 carbon atoms.\n3. Alkaloid: This is a type of organic compound that contains mostly basic nitrogen atoms. Alkaloids are known for their wide range of pharmacological activities.\n4. Herbal aconitum plants: These are plants that contain the chemical aconitine. Aconitum is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, commonly known as monkshood or wolfsbane.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are: Aconitine, diterpenoid, alkaloid, and the chemicals found in herbal aconitum plants."},
