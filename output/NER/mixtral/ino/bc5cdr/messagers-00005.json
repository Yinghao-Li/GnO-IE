Contrast materials (PRC): These are substances used to enhance the visibility of structures during radiographic procedures. They can be chemical compounds, and therefore, they are the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph.\n\nContrast materials, also known as contrast agents or contrast media, are often used in medical imaging techniques like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to improve the visibility of specific organs, tissues, or blood vessels. These materials can be made up of various chemical compounds, such as iodinated contrast agents for X-ray and CT exams or gadolinium-based contrast agents for MRI scans.\n\nIn this context, the abbreviation \"PRC\" likely refers to \"parenteral radiographic contrast,\" which is a type of contrast material administered through routes other than the digestive tract, such as intravenous or intra-arterial injections."},
