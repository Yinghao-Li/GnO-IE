It discusses the effects of a drug, propranolol, on the electrical activity of the heart as measured by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The PR interval is a measure of the time between the beginning of the P wave and the beginning of the QRS complex in an ECG, which reflects the time it takes for an electrical impulse to travel from the atria to the ventricles of the heart. The prolongation of the PR interval could indicate a disturbance in the conduction system of the heart, but it is not a specific disease."},

Propranolol is a type of medication known as a beta blocker, which is used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, and tremors. The \"(-)\" symbol indicates that it is the levo-isomer of propranolol.\n2. The second chemical entity mentioned is \"isoprenaline\". Isoprenaline, also known as isoproterenol, is a medication used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate) and heart block. It is a synthetic catecholamine, a type of hormone and neurotransmitter.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities in the paragraph are \"(+) - propranolol\" and \"isoprenaline\"."},
