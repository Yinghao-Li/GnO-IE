Research or analyze these phrases to determine if they represent a disease entity.\n\nApplying this process to the given paragraph:\n\n1. The potential disease-related phrases are:\n * Second degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block\n * temporary transvenous ventricular pacing\n3. Researching these phrases, we find that:\n * Second degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block: This is a type of heart block, which is a disorder of the electrical conduction system of the heart. Specifically, it is a second-degree atrioventricular block, where not every atrial impulse is conducted to the ventricles, but some are. Mobitz type II is characterized by a constant PR interval until a non-conducted P wave occurs, which differentiates it from Mobitz type I.\n * Temporary transvenous ventricular pacing: This is not a disease itself, but a medical procedure used to treat certain heart conditions, such as the second degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block mentioned earlier. It involves inserting a temporary pacing wire into the heart via a vein to help regulate the heartbeat.\n\nBased on this analysis, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Second degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block"},
