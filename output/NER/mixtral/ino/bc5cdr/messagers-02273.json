It is often associated with diseases such as epilepsy.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing context:\n\n1. Convulsion: The context indicates that the administration of L-arginine increases convulsion incidence and severity, and shortens latency time to the first convulsion. This suggests that convulsion is being discussed in the context of a medical condition or disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Convulsion"},
