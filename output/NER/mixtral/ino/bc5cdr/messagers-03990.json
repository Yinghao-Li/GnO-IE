It is a chemical, specifically a neuropeptide.\n* pressor agent: A pressor agent is a substance that increases blood pressure. It is a general term that can refer to various chemicals, such as vasopressin, epinephrine, or norepinephrine.\n* hypertensive process: Hypertension refers to high blood pressure. It is a medical condition, not a chemical.\n\nConclusion: The chemical entities in the paragraph are \"vasopressin\" and \"pressor agent.\""},
