It might be a specific treatment or drug name, but it is not a well-known or widely recognized chemical.\nP400: Similar to GFC75, P400 is mentioned as a treatment for hippocampus mice, but it is not a well-known or widely recognized chemical.\nAChE: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a well-known chemical entity. It is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetate.\n\nIn summary, the only clear chemical entity in the paragraph is AChE (Acetylcholinesterase).
