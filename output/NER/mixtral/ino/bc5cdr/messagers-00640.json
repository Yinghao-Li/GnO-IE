The first disease mentioned in the paragraph is \"Parkinson's disease.\" It is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system.\n2. The paragraph also mentions \"bradykinesia,\" which is a common motor symptom of Parkinson's disease characterized by slow movement and difficulty initiating movements.\n3. \"Rigidity\" is another motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that is mentioned in the paragraph. It is characterized by stiffness and resistance to movement.\n4. \"Levodopa-induced dyskinesias\" are involuntary movements that can occur as a side effect of levodopa, a medication commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Parkinson's disease\n* Bradykinesia\n* Rigidity\n* Levodopa-induced dyskinesias"},
