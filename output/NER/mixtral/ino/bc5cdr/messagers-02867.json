Encephalopathy\n\nExplanation:\n\nEncephalopathy is a disease entity, which is a condition that affects the brain and may be caused by various factors, such as infections, toxins, or metabolic disorders. It is characterized by altered mental status, confusion, and impaired cognitive function.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the term \"encephalopathy\" is used to describe the changes observed in the patient's EEG during their inpatient stay. Therefore, \"encephalopathy\" is the disease entity in this paragraph.\n\n2. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies\n\nExplanation:\n\nN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies are not a disease entity themselves, but rather a biomarker that can indicate the presence of certain autoimmune disorders, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. This is a specific type of encephalitis that is caused by the production of autoantibodies against the NMDA receptors in the brain.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the presence of low-titre NMDA receptor antibodies in the patient suggests the possibility of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis or another autoimmune disorder affecting the NMDA receptors. Therefore, while NMDA receptor antibodies are not a disease entity, they are relevant to the discussion of the patient's condition and may indicate an underlying disease process."},
