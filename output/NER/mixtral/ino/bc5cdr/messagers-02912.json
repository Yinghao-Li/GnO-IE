Sensory neuropathy - This is a type of peripheral neuropathy that specifically affects the sensory nerves, which are responsible for transmitting sensory information such as touch, temperature, and pain.\n3. Motor neuropathy - This is another type of peripheral neuropathy that affects the motor nerves, which control muscle movement.\n4. Autonomic neuropathy - This is a type of peripheral neuropathy that affects the autonomic nerves, which control involuntary bodily functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are peripheral neuropathy, sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy, and autonomic neuropathy."},
