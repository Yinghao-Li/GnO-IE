Indomethacin: This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. It is a type of chemical compound known as a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor.\n3. Plasma: This is the liquid component of blood, in which cells and cell fragments are suspended. It is a complex mixture of substances, including water, electrolytes, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, hormones, and gases.\n4. Renin: This is an enzyme that is produced by the kidneys. It plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure by helping to control the levels of certain hormones in the body.\n5. Blood pressure (BP): This is a measure of the force that blood exerts on the walls of the arteries as it flows through the body. It is typically expressed as two numbers, with the first number (systolic pressure) representing the pressure when the heart beats, and the second number (diastolic pressure) representing the pressure when the heart is at rest.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are sodium, indomethacin, plasma, renin, and blood pressure (BP)."},
