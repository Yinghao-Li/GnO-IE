RCR: This stands for Respiratory Control Ratio, which is a measure of the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. It is not a chemical, but a biological concept.\n3. Liver mitochondria: These are organelles found in liver cells that generate energy for the cell through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. They are not chemicals.\n4. Control rats: This refers to a group of rats that did not receive Doxorubicin treatment and serve as a control group for comparison. They are not chemicals.\n5. Cytochrome oxidase: This is an enzyme complex found in the inner mitochondrial membrane that plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. It is not a chemical.\n6. Hepatic: This refers to the liver. It is not a chemical.\n7. Activity: This is a biological concept that refers to the rate of a reaction or process. It is not a chemical.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Doxorubicin."},
