However, in the given paragraph, it is not explicitly stated which hormones are being used, so I cannot provide a specific chemical name.\n2. Fractures: A fracture is a break or crack in a bone, not a chemical entity.\n3. Decreased incidence: This phrase refers to a reduction in the frequency of something, in this case, colon cancer and fractures, and is not a chemical entity.\n4. Colon cancer: Colon cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon, a part of the digestive system. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a disease caused by abnormal cell growth.\n5. Long-term use: This phrase refers to the continued use of hormone therapy over an extended period and is not a chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, there are no clear chemical entities mentioned in the provided paragraph. The only mention of a chemical-related term is \"hormone therapy,\" but no specific hormones are named."},
