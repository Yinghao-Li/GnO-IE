Analyze each identified term to determine if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: Potential chemical entities in the text are:\n\n* QTc\n* methadone\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each term:\n\n* QTc: It is an abbreviation for the QT interval corrected for heart rate. The QT interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. QTc is not a chemical, but a measurement or a parameter related to heart function.\n* methadone: It is a synthetic opioid analgesic primarily used in the treatment of pain and as a maintenance anti-addictive treatment in opioid dependence. Methadone is a chemical, specifically an organic compound and a controlled substance.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"methadone.\""},
