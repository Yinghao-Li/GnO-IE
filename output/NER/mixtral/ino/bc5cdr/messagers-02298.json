It is not a chemical entity but a condition caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the body.\n2. Hemodialysis: This is a medical procedure that uses a machine to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys are not working properly. It is not a chemical entity.\n3. Calcium carbonate: This is a chemical compound with the formula CaCO3. It is a common form of calcium supplement and is often used to treat and prevent low blood calcium levels in people with kidney disease.\n4. Calcium: This is a chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20. It is an essential nutrient for living organisms, and is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. In the context of the paragraph, it is a component of calcium carbonate therapy.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are calcium carbonate and calcium."},
