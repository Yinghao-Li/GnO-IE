The paragraph mentions two substances, Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), which are administered to patients to induce and control hypotension during anesthesia.

A condition is a state of health that can be either normal or abnormal, while a disease is a condition that impairs normal functioning and is typically associated with specific symptoms. Hypotension, in this context, refers to abnormally low blood pressure, which can be a symptom of various underlying conditions or diseases."},
