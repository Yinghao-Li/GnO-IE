Analyze the context of each word or phrase to confirm if it is a disease entity.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential disease-related entities are:\n\n1. Low-risk patients\n2. Chest pain\n3. Cocaine-associated chest pain\n\nNow, let's analyze the context of each entity:\n\n1. Low-risk patients: This term refers to a group of patients with a lower likelihood of experiencing adverse health events. It does not represent a specific disease.\n2. Chest pain: Chest pain is a common symptom of various medical conditions, including heart diseases such as angina or myocardial infarction. It can also be caused by non-cardiac conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease or anxiety. Therefore, chest pain can be considered a disease entity, but it is not a specific disease itself.\n3. Cocaine-associated chest pain: This term refers to chest pain caused by the use of cocaine, a powerful stimulant drug. Cocaine use can lead to various cardiovascular complications, including chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardial ischemia) or increased oxygen demand. Thus, cocaine-associated chest pain can be considered a disease entity.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Chest pain\n* Cocaine-associated chest pain"},
