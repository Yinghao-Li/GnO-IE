It refers to a disturbance in the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and the body's ability to detoxify their harmful effects through neutralization by antioxidants.\n2. Mitochondrial dysfunction: This is also a chemical entity. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. Dysfunction refers to a state where the mitochondria are not functioning properly, which can be caused by various chemical factors such as toxins, mutations, or changes in the cellular environment.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"oxidative stress\" and \"mitochondrial dysfunction.\""},
