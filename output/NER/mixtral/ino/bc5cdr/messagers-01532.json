They are not a chemical element, compound, or functional group, so they do not fit the category of \"chemical\" entities.\n2. DOX: This stands for doxorubicin, which is a type of chemotherapy drug used to treat various cancers. Doxorubicin is a chemical compound, specifically an anthracycline antibiotic.\n3. peptide linkages: A peptide linkage is a chemical bond that forms when two amino acids join together through a condensation reaction, resulting in the formation of a dipeptide.\n4. Gly: This stands for glycine, which is a type of amino acid. Glycine is a simple amino acid with the chemical formula NH2-CH2-COOH.\n5. Gly-Gly: This is a dipeptide formed from two glycine molecules.\n6. Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly: This is a tetrapeptide formed from glycine, phenylalanine, leucine, and glycine.\n\nTherefore, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are doxorubicin, peptide linkages, glycine, and the dipeptide Gly-Gly and tetrapeptide Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly."},
