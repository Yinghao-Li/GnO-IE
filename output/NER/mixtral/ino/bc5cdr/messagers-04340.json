Research and verify if they are indeed chemical entities.\n\nStep 1:\n\n* \"normal and patient's serum proteins\" - proteins are biological macromolecules, but in a chemical context, they can be considered chemicals.\n* \"cephalothin\" - this is a known antibiotic, a chemical compound.\n\nStep 2:\n\n* \"normal and patient's serum proteins\" - Proteins are complex molecules consisting of amino acid chains that fold into specific three-dimensional structures. They are often considered chemicals in a chemical context.\n* \"cephalothin\" - Cephalothin is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, a type of Î²-lactam antibiotic. It is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C12H12N6O4S2.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Serum proteins\n* Cephalothin"},
