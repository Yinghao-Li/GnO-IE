It is not a chemical entity but a medical condition.\n3. Methotrexate: This is a chemotherapy drug used to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. It is a chemical entity.\n4. Cerebrospinal fluid: This is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It is not a chemical entity but a biological fluid.\n5. Preservatives: These are chemicals added to commercially available methotrexate preparations to maintain their stability and sterility. They are chemical entities.\n6.
