It is not a specific disease but rather a symptom or manifestation of an underlying condition.\n2.

High-dose etoposide therapy refers to the administration of this drug at a higher-than-normal dose.\n3. Malignant glioma: This is a specific type of brain tumor that arises from the glial cells, which support and protect the nerve cells in the brain. Malignant glioma is a disease and a type of cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Malignant glioma"},
