    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. CK - MB MI: This refers to a measurement of creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme, which is a protein released into the bloodstream during a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Therefore, \"CK - MB MI\" can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n2. Cardiac death: This is a term used to describe death resulting from a cardiac cause, such as a heart attack. Therefore, \"cardiac death\" can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n3. Significant coronary disease: This refers to the presence of atherosclerosis or blockages in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. A significant coronary disease is often defined as having a stenosis (narrowing) of 50% or greater. Therefore, \"significant coronary disease\" can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nIn summary, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* CK - MB MI\n* Cardiac death\n* Significant coronary disease"},
