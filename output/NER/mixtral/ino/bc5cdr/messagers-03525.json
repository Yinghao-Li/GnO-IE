It is often associated with various heart diseases, such as cardiomyopathy or high blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Heart hypertrophy"},

Isoproterenol: It is a medication used to treat bradycardia (slow heart rate) and heart block (a condition where the electrical signal that triggers the heart to beat isn't transmitted properly). It is a synthetic catecholamine, a type of drug that mimics the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body. It is a chemical substance.\n\nb. Heart hypertrophy: It is a medical condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively. It is not a chemical substance but a medical condition.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"isoproterenol.\""},
