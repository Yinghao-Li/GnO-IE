Analyze each term to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nThe potential disease-related terms in the paragraph are:\n\n* Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC patients\n* two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens\n* one platinum based (stratum 1)\n* both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stratum 2)\n\nNow, let's analyze each term:\n\n1. Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC patients: NSCLC stands for non-small cell lung cancer, which is a type of lung cancer. Here, stage IIIb and IV refer to the extent of cancer spread, and thus are related to the disease.\n2. two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens: This term refers to a treatment approach for a disease, not the disease itself.\n3. one platinum based (stratum 1): This term refers to a type of chemotherapy regimen, not the disease itself.\n4. both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stratum 2): This term refers to a treatment approach for a disease, not the disease itself.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* NSCLC\n* stage IIIb\n* stage IV"},
