Fas (also known as CD95 or APO-1) is a type of protein that is involved in programmed cell death, or apoptosis. In its \"soluble form,\" it is a protein that has been broken down into smaller molecules and can be found in solution.\n2. Acute liver failure: While not a chemical in the traditional sense, \"acute liver failure\" is a medical condition that involves the failure of the liver to perform its normal functions. It is not a chemical entity, but it is included in the paragraph because it is relevant to the study being discussed.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the \"soluble form of Fas\" and, to a lesser extent, \"liver\" (as a component of the condition \"acute liver failure\")."},
