Mitochondrial function: Mitochondria are organelles found in cells that are responsible for energy production. While not a chemical in the traditional sense, altered mitochondrial function refers to changes in the chemical processes and reactions that occur within the mitochondria.\n3. Left ventricular dysfunction: The left ventricle is one of the four chambers of the heart, and its dysfunction refers to impaired pumping ability. This impairment can be caused by various chemical processes, such as the production of reactive oxygen species or changes in energy metabolism.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are cocaine, altered mitochondrial function, and left ventricular dysfunction."},
