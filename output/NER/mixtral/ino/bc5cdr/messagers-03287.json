Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it is being used to describe a disease or medical condition.\n\nIn this paragraph, the potential disease-related words or phrases are:\n\n* \"reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma\"\n* \"minor fast - moving BChE components : monomer, dimer, and monomer - albumin conjugate are missing\"\n\nLet's analyze the context of each phrase:\n\n* \"reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma\": This phrase is describing a decrease in the amount of a specific enzyme (tetrameric BChE) in the patient's plasma. While a decrease in enzyme levels can be a symptom of a disease, it is not in itself a disease. Therefore, this phrase does not refer to a disease entity.\n* \"minor fast - moving BChE components : monomer, dimer, and monomer - albumin conjugate are missing\": This phrase is describing the absence of certain components of the BChE enzyme in the patient's plasma. The absence of these components could be indicative of a genetic disorder or other medical condition, but the paragraph does not provide enough information to confirm this. Therefore, this phrase may refer to a disease entity, but more information is needed to make a definitive determination.\n\nBased on this analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are not explicitly mentioned. However, the paragraph describes potential symptoms or indicators of a genetic disorder or other medical condition related to the absence of certain BChE components."},

Monomer: A monomer is a single unit or subunit of a larger complex, in this case, the BChE enzyme.\n4.
