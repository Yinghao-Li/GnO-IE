In the given paragraph, it is mentioned as being given to rats to study the mechanisms of seizures.\n\nNo other chemical entities are explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. However, it is worth noting that the paragraph discusses the neuropathological sequelae of temporal lobe epilepsy and the buildup of convulsive activity and pathways involved in the generalization and propagation of seizures. While these are biological processes and not chemical entities per se, they are closely related to the study of neurochemistry and the actions of various neurotransmitters and other chemical messengers in the brain. Therefore, while not chemical entities themselves, these processes are closely related to the field of chemistry."},
