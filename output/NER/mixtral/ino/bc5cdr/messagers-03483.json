However, based on the context of the paragraph, it is likely a chemical or biochemical entity that was attenuated after treatment with HDS.\n2. HR: Based on the context, this is likely an abbreviation for a chemical or biological entity. However, without additional information, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning.\n3. p: In this context, \"p\" likely refers to the probability value or p-value, which is a statistical term used to determine the significance of a result. It is not a chemical entity.\n4. HDS: Based on the context, this is likely an abbreviation for a chemical or pharmacological entity that was used to treat the other entities in the study.\n5. PI: Based on the context, this is likely an abbreviation for a chemical or pharmacological entity that was used as a control or comparison group in the study.\n6. K: This is likely an abbreviation for a chemical or biochemical entity that was attenuated after treatment with HDS.\n7. Glu: Based on the context, this is likely an abbreviation for a chemical or biochemical entity that was attenuated after treatment with HDS. It could potentially stand for glucose or another glucose-related compound, but without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are likely DRC, HR (if it is a chemical entity), K, and Glu. HDS and PI are likely pharmacological entities, and \"p\" is a statistical term."},
