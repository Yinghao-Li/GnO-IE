Cardiomyopathy: While not a chemical, it is a medical condition related to the heart muscle. It is included here because it is the condition being induced in the dogs using cobalt.\n3. VIP: Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide, a neurotransmitter and hormone. It is measured using radioimmunoassay in this paragraph.\n4. Radioimmunoassay: A technique used to measure the concentration of a substance (in this case, VIP).
