Imbalances in these neurotransmitters can contribute to various medical conditions, but they are not diseases themselves.\n\nTherefore, in this paragraph, there are no explicit \"Disease\" entities. However, it does imply the presence of neurological or mental health conditions associated with dopamine/serotonin imbalances."},
