The paragraph discusses the results of a study related to cannabinoid CB1 receptors, motor impairment, DA lesion, and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias.\n2. \"Motor impairment\" refers to a difficulty or inability to perform motor tasks, which can be a symptom of various neurological diseases.\n3. \"DA lesion\" likely refers to a lesion or damage to dopaminergic neurons, which can be a result of Parkinson's disease or other neurological conditions.\n4. \"L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias\" are abnormal, involuntary movements that can occur as a side effect of long-term treatment with L-DOPA, a medication commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Motor impairment (which can be a symptom of various neurological diseases)\n* Parkinson's disease (implied by the mention of DA lesion and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias)"},
