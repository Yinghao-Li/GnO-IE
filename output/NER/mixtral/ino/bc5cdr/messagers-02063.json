However, it's included in the paragraph for context.\n2. CCR2: This is an abbreviation for \"CC chemokine receptor 2,\" which is a type of protein and a chemical receptor. It is, therefore, a chemical entity.\n3. Labeling: Although not a chemical itself, \"labeling\" in this context refers to the application of a chemical marker or stain to identify CCR2 in the experiment.\n4. Hypertrophied astrocytes: Astrocytes are a type of non-neuronal cell in the brain, and \"hypertrophied\" refers to an enlarged state of these cells. While not a chemical, this term is included for completeness.\n5. CA1 and dentate gyrus: These are regions of the brain, specifically part of the hippocampus. They are not chemical entities.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"CCR2\" and the implied \"chemical marker or stain\" used for labeling."},
