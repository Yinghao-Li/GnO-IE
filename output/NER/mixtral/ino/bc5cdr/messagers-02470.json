Renal transplant patient: While \"renal transplant\" is not a disease itself, it refers to a medical procedure performed on a patient with a previous renal disease. Therefore, we can consider \"renal disease\" to be the first implied disease entity in the paragraph.\n2. Proteinuria: This is a condition characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, which can be a symptom or complication of various kidney diseases.\n3. AL amyloidosis: This is the primary disease entity explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. It is a rare and serious condition caused by the buildup of an abnormal protein called amyloid in organs and tissues throughout the body.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Renal disease (implied)\n2. Proteinuria\n3. AL amyloidosis"},
