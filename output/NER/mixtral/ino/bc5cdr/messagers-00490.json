    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Troponin: This is a type of protein found in heart muscles, and elevated levels of troponin in the blood can indicate damage to the heart muscle, such as from a heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI).\n2. CK - MB: This stands for creatine kinase MB, which is an enzyme found in heart muscle cells. Elevated levels of CK-MB in the blood can also indicate damage to the heart muscle.\n3. Necrosis: This is the medical term for the death of cells or tissues in the body. In the context of this paragraph, necrosis likely refers to damage or death of heart muscle cells.\n4. Cocaine-associated chest pain: This refers to chest pain that is caused by the use of cocaine. Cocaine can cause chest pain by constricting blood vessels and reducing blood flow to the heart muscle.\n5. Suspected MI: This refers to a situation where a patient is suspected to have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) based on their symptoms and medical history.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Myocardial infarction (MI)\n* Necrosis (in the context of heart muscle damage)\n* Cocaine-associated chest pain (while not a disease itself, it is a condition that can lead to medical evaluation and diagnosis of a disease)"},
