Epinephrine is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a role in the \"fight or flight\" response and can have harmful effects on the heart when present in high levels or administered exogenously. Therefore, \"epinephrine-induced cardiac injury\" can be considered a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Epinephrine-induced cardiac injury"},
