Myocardial infarction - This term refers to the death of a part of the heart muscle due to the lack of blood supply, which is also known as a heart attack. It is a well-known medical condition and can be considered a disease entity.\n2. Puerperium - This term refers to the period following childbirth, typically six to eight weeks. While it is not a disease itself, it can be associated with certain medical conditions or complications. However, in this context, it is not directly related to a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Myocardial infarction"},
