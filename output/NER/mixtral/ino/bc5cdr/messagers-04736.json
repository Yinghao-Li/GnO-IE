Nonopaque: While not explicitly a chemical, \"nonopaque\" is a term used to describe a physical property of a substance, often related to its interaction with light and therefore can be considered related to chemistry.\n2. Crystal deposition: This refers to the formation of crystals, which is a chemical process involving the arrangement of atoms or molecules into a solid structure.\n3. Ureteric obstruction: While not a chemical itself, this term refers to a blockage in the ureter, which can be caused by the deposition of crystals or other substances, making it related to chemistry.\n4. HIV: Human Immunodeficiency Virus, it's a retrovirus that causes HIV infection and over time AIDS.\n5. Indinavir: This is a chemical name, it's a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infection.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Crystal deposition\n* Indinavir\n\nNote that the other entities mentioned are not chemical entities but they are related to the chemical process or the context of the paragraph."},
