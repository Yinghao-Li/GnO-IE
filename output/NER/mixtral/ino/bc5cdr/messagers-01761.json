It is a specific form of propranolol, which is a type of medication called a beta blocker. Beta blockers work by blocking the effects of certain hormones on the heart and blood vessels, causing the heart to beat more slowly and with less force.\n\n2. The second chemical entity in the paragraph is \"electrocardiogram.\" While not a chemical in the traditional sense, an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. It does not involve the use of chemicals in the same way that a drug or medication does, but it is still relevant to the discussion of the effects of ( + ) - propranolol on the heart.\n\nOverall, the paragraph discusses the effects of ( + ) - propranolol on the electrical activity of the heart, as measured by an electrocardiogram."},
