Superoxide dismutase is a type of enzyme that helps break down potentially harmful oxygen molecules in cells.\n2. Dimethylthiourea (DMTU) - This is also a chemical entity. Dimethylthiourea is a chemical compound that is often used in research as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species.\n3. GM - This is not a chemical entity. It is an abbreviation, which could stand for many things, but in this context, it likely refers to a specific treatment or condition being studied.\n4. CIn - This is not a chemical entity. It is likely an abbreviation for a specific measurement or variable being studied.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Dimethylthiourea (DMTU)."},
