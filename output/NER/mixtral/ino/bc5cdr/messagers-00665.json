In this context, fibrosis affects the orbital soft tissues, which are the tissues surrounding the eye.\n* mechanical restriction of eye movements: This is not a disease itself, but a consequence of the fibrosis of orbital soft tissues.\n* making subsequent enucleation difficult: Enucleation is a surgical procedure to remove the eye. The text suggests that the fibrosis of orbital soft tissues makes this procedure more challenging. This is not a disease itself but a complication due to the fibrosis.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Fibrosis of orbital soft tissues"},
