Research and analyze each term to determine if it is a disease entity.\n\nApplying this process to the paragraph:\n\n1. \"5-FU\" could be an abbreviation for a medical term.\n2. \"FA\" could be an abbreviation for a medical term.\n3. \"Mitomycin C\" is a chemotherapeutic drug used to treat various cancers.\n4. \"ELF\", \"FAM\", and \"FAMTX\" are likely abbreviations for cancer treatment regimens, which may include various diseases.\n\nNow, let's analyze these terms further:\n\n1. \"5-FU\" stands for 5-Fluorouracil, which is an antimetabolite medication used in the treatment of cancer, mainly colon, esophageal, stomach, and skin cancers.\n2. \"FA\" could refer to Fluorouracil and Folinic acid, which is a treatment regimen for various cancers, including colon, rectal, anal, breast, and stomach cancers.\n3. \"Mitomycin C\" is a chemotherapeutic drug used to treat various cancers, such as bladder, breast, esophageal, stomach, and non-small cell lung cancer.\n4. \"ELF\" stands for Epirubicin, Leucovorin, and Fluorouracil, which is a chemotherapy regimen used primarily for the treatment of breast cancer.\n5. \"FAM\" stands for Fluorouracil, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), and Mitomycin, which is a chemotherapy regimen used for the treatment of various cancers, including gastroesophageal, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers.\n6. \"FAMTX\" stands for Fluorouracil, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Mitomycin, and Taxol (paclitaxel), which is a chemotherapy regimen used for the treatment of various cancers, including ovarian, breast, and pancreatic cancers.\n\nDisease entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. Colon cancer\n2. Esophageal cancer\n3. Stomach cancer\n4. Skin cancer\n5. Breast cancer\n6. Anal cancer\n7. Bladder cancer\n8. Non-small cell lung cancer\n9. Gastroesophageal cancer\n10.

However, without further information, it is difficult to be certain.\n3. Mitomycin C (MMC): This is a chemotherapeutic antibiotic used to treat various types of cancer.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Mitomycin C (MMC).
