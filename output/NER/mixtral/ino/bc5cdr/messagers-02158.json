Research and verify if they are indeed chemical entities.\n\nStep 1:\n\n- HIT: This is an abbreviation, which stands for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia. Heparin is a chemical entity, a type of anticoagulant.\n- Thrombosis: This is a medical term, but it is related to a chemical process. Thrombosis refers to the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel, which can obstruct the flow of blood.\n- Heparin: As mentioned earlier, Heparin is a chemical entity. It is an anticoagulant used to prevent blood clots.\n\nStep 2:\n\n- HIT: This is an abbreviation for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia, which is a condition caused by the administration of heparin, a chemical entity.\n- Thrombosis: Thrombosis is a process that involves the formation of a blood clot, which is a chemical reaction.\n- Heparin: Heparin is an anticoagulant, a chemical substance that is used to prevent blood clots.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
