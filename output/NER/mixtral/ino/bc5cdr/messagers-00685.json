Potential chemical entities:\n - Neuroleptic\n - hyperprolactinemia\n2. Verification:\n - Neuroleptic: It is a class of drugs used to manage psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, or disordered thought. Neuroleptics are also called antipsychotics and major tranquilizers. Therefore, Neuroleptic is a chemical entity.\n - Hyperprolactinemia: It is a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of prolactin in the blood. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. Hyperprolactinemia can lead to various symptoms, such as galactorrhea (spontaneous production of breast milk), menstrual irregularities, and decreased sexual desire. Since hyperprolactinemia is a condition related to a specific hormone, it is not a chemical entity but a medical condition caused by an imbalance of certain chemicals.\n\nIn summary, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"Neuroleptic.\""},
