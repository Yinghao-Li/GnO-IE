MAP: This stands for Mean Arterial Pressure, which is a measurement of blood pressure, but in this context, it is being treated as a \"chemical\" entity because it is being monitored as a response to the injection of various substances.\n2. HR: This stands for Heart Rate, which is also a measurement of a physiological response, and is being treated as a \"chemical\" entity for the same reason as MAP.\n3. i.v.: This stands for intravenous, which is a route of administration for the injections. It is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of the chemical substances being injected.\n4. Vehicle: In this context, \"vehicle\" refers to a solution that does not contain any active drug and is used as a control in the experiment. It is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of the chemical substances being injected.\n5. AVP: This stands for Argine Vasopressin, which is a hormone that regulates blood pressure and water balance in the body. It is one of the chemical substances being injected in this experiment.\n6. ANP: This stands for Atrial Natriuretic Peptide, which is a hormone that regulates blood pressure and volume in the body. It is another chemical substance being injected in this experiment.\n7. 1, 10, and 50 ng: These are numerical values representing the doses of AVP being injected in the experiment. They are not chemical entities, but they are mentioned in the context of the chemical substance AVP.\n8. 25, 125, and 500 ng: These are numerical values representing the doses of ANP being injected in the experiment. They are not chemical entities, but they are mentioned in the context of the chemical substance ANP."},
