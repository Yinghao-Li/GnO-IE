Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n * Kinin B2 receptor\n * cisplatin\n * acute renal injury\n2. Narrowing down the list by considering context:\n * Kinin B2 receptor is a biological target, not a disease.\n * Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug, not a disease.\n * Acute renal injury is a medical condition.\n3. Verifying if the remaining phrase refers to a disease or medical condition:\n * Acute renal injury: Yes, it is a medical condition characterized by sudden kidney damage or failure.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Acute renal injury"},
