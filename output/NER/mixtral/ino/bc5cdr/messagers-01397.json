Hypotension: While not a chemical, it is important to note that hypotension is a medical condition characterized by low blood pressure. It is mentioned as an effect of the administration of trimethaphan.\n\n3. Bradycardia: This is another medical condition, characterized by a slower-than-normal heart rate. It is significant in lesioned rats after the administration of trimethaphan.\n\n4. Tachycardia: This is a medical condition characterized by a faster-than-normal heart rate. It is significant in sham rats after the administration of trimethaphan.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Trimethaphan and, to a lesser extent, hypotension, bradycardia, and tachycardia, as they are medical conditions related to the administration of the drug."},
