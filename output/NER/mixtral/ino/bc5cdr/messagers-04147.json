Determine if the words or phrases refer to a specific disease or medical condition.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential disease-related phrase is \"abdominal pain.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the context:\n\n1. The paragraph mentions a group (Endografine) with a higher incidence of this condition.\n2. The phrase \"higher incidence\" suggests that this is a medical issue or condition affecting the group.\n3. \"Abdominal pain\" is a common symptom of various medical conditions and diseases.\n\nBased on the context, \"abdominal pain\" refers to a symptom or manifestation of a disease, rather than being the disease itself. Unfortunately, the paragraph does not provide enough information to identify a specific disease associated with the abdominal pain. Therefore, we can only identify \"abdominal pain\" as a health-related issue in this context."},
