Narrowing down to specific medical conditions or diseases: myocardial ischemia\n3. Analyzing the context: The paragraph describes a case of myocardial ischemia caused by cocaine use. Myocardial ischemia is a medical condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, often resulting in chest pain or discomfort. Therefore, \"myocardial ischemia\" is the disease entity in this paragraph.\n\nNote: Cocaine is not considered a disease; it is a substance that can induce or trigger medical conditions, such as myocardial ischemia."},

Although it is not a chemical compound, it is a condition related to the heart and blood vessels, which can be influenced by certain chemicals, such as cocaine.\n* Cocaine is a powerful and highly addictive stimulant drug derived from the leaves of the coca plant (Erythroxylum coca). It is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C~17~H~21~NO~4~.\n\nBased on the verification, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cocaine"},
