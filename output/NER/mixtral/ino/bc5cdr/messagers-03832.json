It is a chemical entity.\n2. 75 mg: This is a quantity of a chemical substance, but without knowing the specific chemical it refers to, it's hard to say for sure. However, in this context, it is likely referring to the dose of PPA.\n3. Blood pressure: While not a chemical itself, blood pressure is often measured in units of millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), which is a chemical.\n4. Propranolol: This is a medication used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, and angina. It is a chemical entity.\n5. mm Hg: As mentioned earlier, this is a unit of measurement for pressure, and it is a chemical (mercury).\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are PPA, 75 mg (implicitly referring to PPA), propranolol, and mm Hg."},
