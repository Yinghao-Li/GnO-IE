The first chemical entity in the paragraph is \"procaterol.\" Procaterol is a long-acting beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist used as a bronchodilator in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n2.

It is the \"asthmatic\" effect, which is a response to a chemical or compound that causes bronchoconstriction in individuals with asthma.\n3. The third chemical entity is also implied and not explicitly mentioned. It is the \"tremorgenic\" effect, which is a side effect of certain chemicals or compounds that can cause tremors or shaking.\n\nSo, the identified chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
