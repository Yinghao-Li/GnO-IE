Mesna is an abbreviation for the chemical compound Sodium 2-Mercaptoethanesulfonate, which is used as a medication to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis (inflammation of the bladder) caused by the anti-cancer drug ifosfamide (IFO).\n2. IFO: This is also a chemical entity. IFO is an abbreviation for the chemical compound Ifosfamide, which is an anti-cancer drug used to treat various types of cancer.\n3. SCEs: Although not explicitly stated, SCEs most likely refer to Sister Chromatid Exchanges, which are a type of DNA damage. While not a chemical itself, SCEs are related to the chemical entities Mesna and IFO in this context.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Mesna, IFO, and SCEs (implicitly)."},
