It is an alkaloid, which is a class of naturally occurring organic compounds that contain mostly basic nitrogen atoms.\n2. 4 - aminopyridine: This is a synthetic organic compound that is used in research and medicine. It is a type of pyridine derivative, which is a class of compounds characterized by a pyridine ring, a six-membered aromatic heterocycle containing one nitrogen atom.\n3. Morphine: This is a natural opiate alkaloid that is derived from the opium poppy.
