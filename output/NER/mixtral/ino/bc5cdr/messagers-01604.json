Lidocaine: This is also a local anesthetic, used to prevent pain or discomfort during various medical procedures.\n3. Prostaglandin E2: This is a type of prostaglandin, which is a lipid compound that acts as a hormone. It is involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including inflammation and pain perception.\n4. Cyclooxygenase: This is an enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins. It has two main isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, and is the target of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nThese are the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
