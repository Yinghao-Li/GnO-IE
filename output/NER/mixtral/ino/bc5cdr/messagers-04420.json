If you could provide a paragraph that contains information about specific diseases, I would be happy to help identify them and remove any irrelevant entities.\n\nHowever, to answer your question generally, \"Disease\" entities typically refer to specific medical conditions that affect the health of living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, or genetic disorders. Examples of disease entities include \"cancer,\" \"Alzheimer's disease,\" \"influenza,\" and \"diabetes.\" These entities are usually proper nouns or specific medical terms that are widely recognized and accepted in the medical community."},
