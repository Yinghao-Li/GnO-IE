In recent years, the world has faced various health challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the resurgence of tuberculosis, and the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in millions of deaths and has had a profound impact on the global economy. Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs, has been on the rise, with drug-resistant strains becoming increasingly common. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, also known as superbugs, pose a significant threat to public health, as common infections become difficult to treat and can lead to severe complications.\n\nDiseases:\n\n* COVID-19\n* tuberculosis\n* antibiotic-resistant bacteria (also known as superbugs)"},
