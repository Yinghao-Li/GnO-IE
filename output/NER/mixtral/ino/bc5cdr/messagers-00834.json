It is a \"chemical\" entity because it is a protein with a specific chemical structure and function.\n3. Human and mouse PPARalpha: These are the specific forms of PPARalpha found in humans and mice, respectively. They are \"chemical\" entities because they are proteins with specific chemical structures and functions.\n4. HepG2 hepatoma cells: These are a type of human liver cancer cell line that is often used in research to study the effects of various chemicals and drugs on liver function.
