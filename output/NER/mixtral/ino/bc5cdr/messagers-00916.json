It is mentioned in the paragraph as being tested at different dosages.\n2. 5-HT (5-Hydroxytryptamine or Serotonin): This is a chemical compound that is a neurotransmitter in the brain. It is mentioned in the paragraph as having a role in the tonic inhibition of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons.\n3. Dexamphetamine: This is a chemical compound that is a psychostimulant drug. It is mentioned in the paragraph as being potentiated by trazodone.\n4. Haloperidol: This is a chemical compound that is an antipsychotic drug. It is mentioned in the paragraph as being antagonized by trazodone.\n5.
