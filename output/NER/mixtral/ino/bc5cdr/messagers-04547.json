In this context, they are likely being discussed as substances that affect the body's response to increased carbon dioxide levels.\n2. hypercapnic ventilatory response: This refers to the body's response to increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood, specifically the increase in breathing rate and depth. While not a chemical itself, it is a response that is triggered by changes in the levels of certain chemicals in the body.\n3. central chemosensitivity: This refers to the body's sensitivity to changes in the levels of chemicals in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which can affect breathing rate and depth. It is not a chemical entity itself, but rather a property of the nervous system that is influenced by changes in chemical levels.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"releasing hormones\" and \"carbon dioxide (CO2)\"."},
