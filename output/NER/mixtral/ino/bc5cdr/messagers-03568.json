Analyze the context of each phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nApplying this process to the paragraph:\n\n1. Phrases:\n * \"breaks in the lateral cell membranes\"\n * \"intercellular and intracellular edema\"\n * \"disintegration of the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes\"\n * \"progressive degeneration and detachment of the epithelial cells\"\n * \"exposure and splitting of the basal membrane\"\n2. Analyzing context:\n * \"breaks in the lateral cell membranes\" - This phrase refers to damage to the cell membranes, not a specific disease.\n * \"intercellular and intracellular edema\" - Edema is a symptom or manifestation of various medical conditions, not a disease itself.\n * \"disintegration of the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes\" - This phrase refers to damage to cell structures, not a specific disease.\n * \"progressive degeneration and detachment of the epithelial cells\" - This phrase describes a process, not a specific disease.\n * \"exposure and splitting of the basal membrane\" - This phrase refers to damage to the basal membrane, not a specific disease.\n\nConclusion: There are no clear \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph. The text describes processes and symptoms that can be associated with various medical conditions."},

Plasma membranes: Like lateral cell membranes, these are also not chemical entities but structural components of cells.\n3. Intercellular edema: Edema refers to the accumulation of excess fluid in the intercellular spaces, so it is a chemical process involving fluid and solutes.\n4. Intracellular edema: Similar to intercellular edema, intracellular edema refers to the accumulation of excess fluid within the cells, which is a chemical process.\n5. Desmosomes: These are not chemical entities, but rather specialized intercellular junctions that provide structural support to tissues.\n6. Hemidesmosomes: These are not chemical entities either, but rather specialized junctions that anchor epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane.\n7. Basal membrane: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a thin sheet of extracellular matrix that separates the epithelial cells from the underlying connective tissue.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are intercellular edema and intracellular edema."},
