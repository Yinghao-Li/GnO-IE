Neurotoxicity: While not a chemical itself, neurotoxicity refers to the adverse effects of chemicals on the nervous system.\n3. Dose: This is a general term, but in this context, it likely refers to the amount of busulfan administered, which is a chemical entity.\n4. High-dose: This is a descriptor of the dose of busulfan, and not a chemical entity itself.\n5. Children: While not a chemical entity, I included it for completeness as it is a key subject in the study.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"busulfan\" and \"neurotoxicity\" (indirectly)."},
