It is a disease entity as it indicates a disorder or abnormal condition affecting the kidney.\n* CM administration: CM likely refers to a specific medical contrast medium or substance used in imaging procedures. While not a disease itself, it can potentially cause renal damage in some patients.\n* PCI patients: PCI stands for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, a medical procedure for treating coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Renal damage\n2. Coronary artery disease (implied in PCI patients)"},
