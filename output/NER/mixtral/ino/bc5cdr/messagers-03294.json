It is a condition where there is abnormal breakdown of red blood cells, leading to anemia.\n* severe malaria: The context shows that this is the disease for which artesunate is the first-line treatment. It is a life-threatening form of malaria caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted via the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.\n\nDisease entities: delayed hemolytic anemia, severe malaria"},
