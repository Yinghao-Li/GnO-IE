Peroxisome Proliferator: It is a term used to describe a substance that causes peroxisomes to grow or multiply.\n4. Activated Receptor: It is a term used to describe a protein that binds to a specific molecule (ligand) and becomes activated, leading to a specific response.\n5. Ligand: It is a molecule that binds to a specific protein (receptor) to form a complex and elicit a response.\n6. Nuclear Hormone Receptor: It is a type of receptor that is found in the nucleus of a cell and binds to hormones to regulate gene expression.\n7.
