It is mentioned in the context of the experiment, so it is still relevant.\n2. Arterial and venous catheters: These are medical devices used to administer or withdraw fluids from the bloodstream. They can be made of various materials, including some that may be considered chemicals. However, in this context, they are not being discussed as chemicals, but rather as tools used in the experiment.\n\nTherefore, the only \"chemical\" entity in the paragraph is the lateral ventricle (LV)."},
