Analyzing each term:\n- Acute leukemia: This is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is a well-defined disease.\n- Post-chemotherapy anemia: Anemia is a condition characterized by a lower than normal number of red blood cells or lower than normal levels of hemoglobin in the blood. In this context, it is a result of chemotherapy treatment for acute leukemia. However, it is not a disease itself, but rather a side effect or complication of the treatment.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Acute leukemia"},
