Vehicle: In the context of scientific research, a \"vehicle\" typically refers to a substance that is used to deliver another substance (such as a drug or chemical) to a subject. It is possible that in this case, the \"vehicle\" is a chemical compound, although it is not explicitly identified as such.\n3. AVP: This is an abbreviation for arginine vasopressin, which is a hormone that is involved in regulating blood pressure and water balance in the body.\n4. ANP: This is an abbreviation for atrial natriuretic peptide, which is a hormone that is produced by the heart and helps to regulate blood pressure and fluid balance in the body.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are CCB (if it is a chemical compound), AVP (arginine vasopressin), and ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide)."},
