It is a highly addictive psychoactive drug that is used in cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco products.\n2. Seizures: While not a chemical, seizures are a medical condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including exposure to certain chemicals such as nicotine.\n3. Hippocampal: This is a region of the brain that is involved in learning and memory. It contains a high concentration of nicotinic receptors.\n4. Nicotinic receptors: These are a type of receptor in the brain that are activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, as well as by nicotine. They are involved in a variety of cognitive and physiological processes, including learning, memory, and addiction.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are nicotine and nicotinic receptors."},
