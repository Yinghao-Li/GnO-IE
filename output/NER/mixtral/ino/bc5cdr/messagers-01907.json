A tumor is a mass of cells that forms when normal cells begin to change and grow uncontrollably. A tumor can be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous, meaning it can spread to other parts of the body). In this case, the tumor is described as \"archival,\" which means it has been preserved for historical or medical record-keeping purposes."},

It is not a chemical itself, but a biological entity. However, rapamycin, which is a chemical, is the compound that mTOR is named after, as it was first identified as a compound that binds to and inhibits mTOR.\n2. Immunohistochemistry (IHC): This is a technique used to detect specific proteins in tissues using antibodies, and is not a chemical entity.\n3. Direct mutation sequencing: This is a technique used to determine the sequence of DNA, and is not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the only possible chemical entity in the paragraph is \"rapamycin,\" which is indirectly mentioned as part of the mTOR pathway's name.
