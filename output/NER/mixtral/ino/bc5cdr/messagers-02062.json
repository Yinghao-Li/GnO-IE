Analyze each potential chemical entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential chemical entities are:\n\n* CCR2\n\nNow, let's analyze each potential chemical entity:\n\n* CCR2: CCR2 (C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 2) is a protein that is a member of the chemokine receptor family. Chemokines are a family of small cytokines, or signaling proteins, that are secreted by cells and affect the migration and activation of other cells, particularly immune cells. CCR2 is the receptor for the chemokine CCL2 (also known as MCP-1, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1). Since CCR2 is a protein, it is not a chemical in the traditional sense.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"chemical\" entities in the given paragraph."},
