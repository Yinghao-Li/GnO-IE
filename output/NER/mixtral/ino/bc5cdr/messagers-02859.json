MDMA is classified as an entactogen or an empathogen and has been described as having both stimulant and hallucinogenic effects. Therefore, \"Ecstasy\" is a chemical entity in this paragraph.\n\n2. Memory consolidation: While not a chemical itself, memory consolidation refers to the process by which the brain stabilizes a memory trace after the initial acquisition. It is a cognitive process and not a chemical entity.\n\n3. Associative interference: This term refers to the phenomenon where new learning interferes with the recall of previously learned information. It is a cognitive process and not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"Ecstasy.\""},
