The first disease entity in the paragraph is \"hypoparathyroidism.\" This is a condition in which the parathyroid glands in the neck do not produce enough parathyroid hormone, leading to low levels of calcium in the blood.\n2. The second disease entity is \"milk-alkali syndrome.\" This is a condition that can occur when someone consumes large amounts of calcium and absorbable alkali, such as in milk and antacids. It can lead to high levels of calcium in the blood, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and kidney problems.\n\nBoth of these conditions are mentioned in the context of a patient's medical history and treatment."},
