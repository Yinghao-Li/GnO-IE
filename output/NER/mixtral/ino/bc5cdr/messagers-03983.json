They are chemical entities as they refer to specific parts of a molecule.\n2. tetrapeptide (CCK-5-8): This is a chemical entity, specifically a type of peptide. A peptide is a chain of amino acids, and a tetrapeptide is a peptide made up of four amino acids. CCK refers to cholecystokinin, a hormone that is important in digestion. The numbers 5-8 indicate the specific sequence of amino acids within the cholecystokinin molecule.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are N - and C - terminal and tetrapeptide (CCK-5-8)."},
