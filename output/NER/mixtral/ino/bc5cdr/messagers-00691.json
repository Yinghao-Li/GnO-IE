The first disease entity in the paragraph is \"neuroleptic-associated hyperprolactinemia.\" Neuroleptics are a type of medication used to manage psychiatric conditions, and hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of the hormone prolactin in the blood. In this case, the hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of the neuroleptic medication.\n2. The second disease entity is \"amenorrhea / galactorrhea.\" Amenorrhea is a condition in which a woman of reproductive age fails to have menstrual periods. Galactorrhea is a condition in which a woman produces milk from her breasts when she is not pregnant or breastfeeding. These two conditions can be related to high levels of prolactin in the blood.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"neuroleptic-associated hyperprolactinemia,\" \"amenorrhea,\" and \"galactorrhea.\""},

Analyze each word or phrase to determine if it is a chemical entity.\n\nStep 1:\n\n* bromocriptine\n* neuroleptic\n* hyperprolactinemia\n* amenorrhea / galactorrhea\n\nStep 2:\n\n* bromocriptine: This is a medication used to treat various conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and pituitary tumors. It is a chemical entity, specifically a dopamine receptor agonist.\n* neuroleptic: While not a chemical itself, neuroleptics are a class of medications used primarily to manage psychosis, including antipsychotics. They can cause side effects like hyperprolactinemia.\n* hyperprolactinemia: This is a medical condition characterized by abnormally high levels of prolactin in the blood. It is not a chemical entity but a condition caused by an imbalance of hormones.\n* amenorrhea / galactorrhea: These are medical conditions related to the menstrual cycle and lactation, respectively. Amenorrhea is the absence of menstruation, while galactorrhea is the spontaneous flow of milk from the breast. They are not chemical entities but potential side effects of elevated prolactin levels.\n\nConclusion: The chemical entities in the paragraph are bromocriptine and neuroleptics (indirectly mentioned as a class of medications)."},
