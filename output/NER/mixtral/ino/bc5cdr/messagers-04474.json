It's discussing the results of an examination of F2 pituitaries in rats, where they are looking for specific phenotypes (observable characteristics) such as hemorrhage (bleeding) and mass (size).\n2. The \"disease\" entities in this context are related to the abnormal or undesirable conditions found in these pituitaries.\n3. In this paragraph, the \"disease\" entity is the \"hemorrhagic phenotype.\" This term refers to the abnormal condition where the pituitary exhibits bleeding.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n- hemorrhagic phenotype"},
