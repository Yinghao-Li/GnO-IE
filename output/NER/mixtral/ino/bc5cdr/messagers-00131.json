Medical diseases: Although this term is broad and not a specific disease, it is referring to various diseases that can cause hypercalcemia.\n3. Bipolar disorder: This is a mental health condition, but patients with this disorder taking lithium can develop hypercalcemia as a side effect, so it is relevant in this context.\n4.
