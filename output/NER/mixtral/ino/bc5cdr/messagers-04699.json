It is a \"Disease\" entity mentioned in the title of the paragraph.\n\nThere are no other disease entities explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. However, it does mention \"intrathecal methotrexate,\" which is a medical treatment used for certain conditions, such as cancer. Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug that can have side effects, including neurotoxicity, which can lead to paraplegia in some cases. Therefore, while methotrexate is not a disease itself, it is relevant to the discussion of paraplegia in this context."},

Therefore, the chemical entity in this paragraph is:\n\n1. Methotrexate: This is a chemotherapeutic agent that is used to treat various types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, and osteosarcoma. It works by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which is necessary for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Intrathecal administration of methotrexate is used to treat meningeal leukemia or lymphoma, where the cancer has spread to the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord."},
