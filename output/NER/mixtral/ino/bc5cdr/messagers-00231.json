The potential disease-related words or phrases are \"cardiac toxicity,\" \"cocaine metabolite,\" and \"ethanol.\"\n2. \"Cardiac toxicity\" is a medical condition where the heart is damaged due to exposure to harmful substances.\n3. \"Cocaine metabolite\" is a substance produced when the body breaks down cocaine, which can be harmful and contribute to medical conditions.\n4. \"Ethanol\" is another term for alcohol, which can cause various diseases and medical conditions when consumed excessively.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cardiac toxicity\n* Cocaine metabolite (in the context of its potential harmfulness)\n* Ethanol (in the context of its potential harmfulness when consumed excessively)"},

Analyze each identified word or phrase to determine if it clearly refers to a disease or medical condition.\n\nApplying this process to the previously identified entities:\n\n* Cardiac toxicity: This is a clear medical condition where the heart is damaged due to exposure to harmful substances.\n* Cocaine metabolite: While it is a substance produced by the body when breaking down cocaine, it is not a disease itself. However, in the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned as a potential contributor to cardiac toxicity, so it can be considered relevant to the discussion of diseases.\n* Ethanol: Ethanol is a chemical compound found in alcoholic beverages. While it is not a disease itself, excessive consumption can lead to various medical conditions, such as alcoholism or liver disease. In the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned as a factor in the formation of cocaethylene, which may contribute to cardiac toxicity. Therefore, it can be considered relevant to the discussion of diseases.\n\nBased on this analysis, the entities that clearly refer to Disease are:\n\n* Cardiac toxicity"},
