Prevalence refers to the proportion of a population that has a specific disease or characteristic at a given time.\n2. Predictors: This is not a disease entity.

However, it is more commonly referred to as a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD).\n4. Induced dyskinesia: This is a disease entity. Dyskinesia refers to involuntary muscle movements, and in this context, it is being induced by the medication levodopa.\n5. Parkinson's disease (PD): This is a disease entity. It is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"levodopa-induced dyskinesia\" and \"Parkinson's disease (PD)\"."},
