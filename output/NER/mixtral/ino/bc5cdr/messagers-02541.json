Postoperative course of platelets: This phrase refers to the changes in the number of platelets in a person's blood after surgery, so it is also a chemical entity.\n3. Clinical signs of HIT type II: HIT stands for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia, which is a condition in which the drug heparin causes a decrease in the number of platelets.
