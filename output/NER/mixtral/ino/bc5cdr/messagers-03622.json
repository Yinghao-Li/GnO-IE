Calcium channel blockers: These are a class of drugs that disrupt calcium ions from entering muscle cells, which can help relax and widen blood vessels.\n3. Headache: While not a chemical, it's included here for completeness as it is mentioned in the paragraph as a common side effect of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.\n4. Facial flushing: Similar to headache, this is a side effect mentioned in the paragraph.\n5. Palpitations: This is a term used to describe awareness of heartbeats, which can be a side effect of certain medications.\n6. Edema: This is a medical condition characterized by an excess accumulation of fluid in the body's tissues.\n7. Nausea: This is an unpleasant sensation in the stomach, often accompanied by an urge to vomit.\n8. Anorexia: This term can refer to a loss of appetite or to an eating disorder characterized by extreme weight loss and distorted body image.
