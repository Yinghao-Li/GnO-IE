    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Ca2+: This is a chemical entity, specifically an ion of the element calcium. In this paragraph, it is referred to as \"cytosolic Ca2+ activity,\" which is a measure of the concentration of calcium ions inside the cell.\n2. Fluo3: This is a chemical entity, specifically a fluorescent dye that is used to measure calcium ion concentrations in cells. In this paragraph, it is used in conjunction with FACS analysis to determine \"cytosolic Ca2+ activity.\"\n3. FACS analysis: While not a chemical entity itself, FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting) analysis is a technique that uses fluorescent dyes to label and sort cells based on specific characteristics. In this paragraph, it is used to determine \"cytosolic Ca2+ activity,\" \"cell volume,\" and \"PS-exposure.\"\n4. Cell volume: This is a chemical property of cells, specifically the amount of space that a cell occupies. In this paragraph, it is measured using \"forward scatter\" in FACS analysis.\n5. PS-exposure: This is a chemical property of cells, specifically the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer membrane of cells. In this paragraph, it is measured using \"annexin V binding\" in FACS analysis.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Ca2+, Fluo3, and PS (phosphatidylserine)."},
