Although it can cause side effects, it is not a disease itself.\n2. hemolytic anemia: This is a condition where the body's immune system destroys its own red blood cells, leading to anemia. It is indeed a disease entity.\n3. near-syncope: This term refers to a feeling of lightheadedness or almost fainting. While it can be a symptom of various medical conditions, it is not a disease itself.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* hemolytic anemia"},
