It is not a disease itself, but can be a symptom of an underlying heart condition.\n2. Intermittent sinoatrial block: This is a heart condition where the electrical impulse that triggers the heartbeat is blocked or delayed in the sinoatrial node, which is the heart's natural pacemaker. This can result in a slow or irregular heart rhythm.\n3. Propranolol: This is a medication used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and angina. It is not a disease, but it can cause side effects such as alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial block.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Intermittent sinoatrial block"},
