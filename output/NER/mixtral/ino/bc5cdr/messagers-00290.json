ECG: While ECG is an abbreviation for electrocardiogram, which is a medical test and not a chemical, it is sometimes referred to as an \"electrocardiographic recording,\" which would make it a chemical entity. However, in this context, it is more likely being used to refer to the medical test itself, not the chemical recording produced by the test.\n3. Tropinin I level: Tropinin I is a protein that is found in the heart muscle. It is not a chemical in the traditional sense, but it is a biological molecule that can be measured and quantified, so it could be considered a chemical entity in a broad sense.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are cocaine and possibly tropinin I level."},
