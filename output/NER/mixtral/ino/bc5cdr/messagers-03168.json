Status epilepticus: This is a medical condition characterized by prolonged or repeated seizures, and not a chemical entity.\n4. Increase: This is not a chemical entity, but a general term used to describe a change in a quantity or measurement.\n5. Latency: This is not a chemical entity, but a term used to describe the time interval between a stimulus and a response.\n6. Decrease: This is not a chemical entity, but a general term used to describe a change in a quantity or measurement.\n7. Mortality rate: This is not a chemical entity, but a term used to describe the proportion of individuals in a population who die within a specific period of time.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entities in the paragraph are GFC and pilocarpine."},
