Analyze each one to confirm if it is a disease entity.\n\nApplying these steps to the paragraph:\n\n1. Potential disease entities:\n * methotrexate neurotoxicity\n * acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n2. Analyzing each potential disease entity:\n * methotrexate neurotoxicity: It refers to the adverse effects of methotrexate on the nervous system. It is a condition resulting from methotrexate treatment, so it is a disease entity.\n * acute lymphoblastic leukemia: It is a type of cancer affecting the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the production of abnormal lymphoblasts. It is a well-known disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* methotrexate neurotoxicity\n* acute lymphoblastic leukemia"},

Intrathecal (IT) therapy: While not a chemical itself, this term refers to the administration of chemicals (such as drugs) directly into the spinal canal.\n3. Leucovorin rescue: This is a chemical treatment that involves the administration of leucovorin, a form of folic acid, to help reduce the toxic effects of certain chemotherapy drugs, such as methotrexate.\n4. Frequency of systemic MTX administration: This refers to the administration of methotrexate (MTX) into the bloodstream, allowing it to reach cancer cells throughout the body.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are methotrexate (MTX), leucovorin, and the general concept of chemotherapy drugs."},
