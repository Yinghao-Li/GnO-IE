Immuno / histochemistry: While not a chemical itself, this term refers to techniques used to detect the presence or location of certain chemicals (usually proteins or other large molecules) in tissues or cells.\n2. Electron microscopy: This is a technique used to visualize the structure of cells and tissues at a very high resolution, but it is not a chemical entity.\n3. Malondialdehyde: This is a chemical compound that is produced as a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, which is a process that can damage cells and tissues.\n4. Superoxide dismutase: This is a type of enzyme that helps to protect cells from damage by breaking down toxic superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase."},
