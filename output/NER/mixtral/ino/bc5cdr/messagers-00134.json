Nephrotoxicity: Nephrotoxicity is not a chemical entity, but rather a condition or adverse effect that can be caused by certain chemicals or drugs.\n3. Lipid nanosphere (NS-718): NS-718 is a specific type of lipid nanosphere, which is a type of nanoparticle used in drug delivery systems. Lipids and nanospheres are chemical entities.\n4. Amphotericin B: Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication. It is a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are lipid nanosphere (NS-718) and amphotericin B."},
