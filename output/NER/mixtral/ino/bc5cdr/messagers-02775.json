Sulfuric acid is a colorless, oily, dense, and corrosive liquid, while hydrochloric acid is a highly pungent and fuming liquid. Both acids are highly soluble in water and are commonly used in various industrial applications. For instance, sulfuric acid is used in the production of fertilizers, while hydrochloric acid is used in the production of steel and other metals. Sodium chloride, also known as table salt, is a white, crystalline solid that is widely used as a seasoning in food and in the preservation of food.\""}
