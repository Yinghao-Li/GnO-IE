Determine which of those nouns refer to chemicals.\n\nThe nouns in the paragraph are:\n\n* Methods\n* SE\n* pilocarpine\n* injection\n\nTo determine which of these nouns refer to chemicals, we can use our background knowledge that pilocarpine is a chemical (specifically, a cholinergic agonist used in eye drops to treat glaucoma and in research to induce seizures in animals). Therefore, \"pilocarpine\" is the chemical entity in the paragraph.\n\nNote: SE is an abbreviation that could refer to a variety of things, including a medical condition or a scientific measurement, but it does not refer to a chemical. Similarly, \"injection\" refers to a medical procedure, not a chemical."},
