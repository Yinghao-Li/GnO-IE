Lung cancer: This is a type of cancer that starts in the lungs and is mentioned as a possibility based on the results of the CT and positron emission tomography scans.\n2. Amiodarone: This is a medication that is used to treat heart rhythm disorders. It is mentioned as the likely cause of the lung lesion in this case.\n3. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates: These are abnormal collections of immune cells called lymphocytes and plasma cells.\n4. Foamy macrophages: These are a type of white blood cell that can accumulate in the lungs and other organs. They are called \"foamy\" because they contain lipids, which give them a bubbly or foamy appearance.\n5. Myelinoid bodies: These are lipid-containing structures that are found in the foamy macrophages in this case. They are called \"myelinoid\" because they resemble the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers.\n\nIn summary, the \"chemical\" entities in this paragraph are the medication amiodarone and the lipids that are found in the foamy macrophages."},
