It is not a chemical in the traditional sense, but it is a biological entity related to a chemical (hepatitis B virus).\n2. Placebo: This is a substance or treatment that has no therapeutic effect and is used as a control in clinical trials. It is often a sugar pill or saline solution, but in this case, it is not specified what the placebo is.\n3. Lamivudine: This is an antiviral medication used to treat chronic hepatitis B and HIV infection.
