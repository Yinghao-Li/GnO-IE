It works by blocking the action of neuromuscular junctions, leading to muscle paralysis.\n3.

Atypical cholinesterase is a variant of this enzyme that has reduced activity, leading to prolonged action of suxamethonium.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are suxamethonium, pancuronium, and cholinesterase."},
