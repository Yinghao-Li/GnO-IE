Plasma concentration: This refers to the amount of simvastatin present in the plasma, which is the liquid component of blood. Plasma concentration is a measure of the amount of a chemical substance (in this case, simvastatin) in the blood.\n3. Statin: This is a general term for a class of drugs that are used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. Statins work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a key role in the production of cholesterol in the body.\n4. Muscle toxicity: This is a potential side effect of statin use, characterized by muscle pain, weakness, and damage. Muscle toxicity is thought to be related to the concentration of the statin in the blood.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are simvastatin, plasma concentration, and statin."},
