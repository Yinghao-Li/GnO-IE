In the given paragraph, there are two potential medical conditions or diseases mentioned:\n   - Nicergoline withdrawal: Nicergoline is a medication used to improve blood flow to the brain and is sometimes used to treat certain conditions like Alzheimer's disease or dementia. In this context, \"withdrawal\" implies that the individual had been taking nicergoline, and stopping its usage could be considered a medical condition or disease aspect.\n   - Renal function recovery: Renal function refers to the functioning of the kidneys. In this case, the text mentions that the individual's renal function was \"completely recovered,\" which implies that there had been some issue with their kidney function previously.\n\nTo summarize, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Nicergoline withdrawal\n2. Renal function issue (not explicitly mentioned but implied)"},
