Acute renal failure: This is a medical condition where the kidneys suddenly stop working properly. It can be caused by various factors, including certain medications like rifampicin.\n2. Rifampicin: Although not a disease itself, rifampicin is an antibiotic drug that can cause acute renal failure as a side effect in some cases. Therefore, it is relevant in the context of discussing diseases.\n\nThus, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Acute renal failure"},
