It is not a chemical itself, but it does involve an ion (calcium) that can be classified as a chemical element.\n* period - This is a term related to time and does not represent a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the only potential chemical entity in the paragraph is \"calcium,\" which is part of the term \"hypercalcemia.\" However, \"calcium\" is not explicitly mentioned as a chemical in the text.
