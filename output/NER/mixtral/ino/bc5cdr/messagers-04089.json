Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph \"Hematologic toxicity was moderate and with reversible anemia developing in 71 % of patients\", the potential disease-related words or phrases are \"hematologic toxicity\" and \"reversible anemia\".\n\nNow let's analyze the context:\n\n1. Hematologic toxicity: This term refers to the adverse effects on the blood and blood-forming organs, which is a side effect of certain medical treatments or conditions. Therefore, \"hematologic toxicity\" can be considered a disease entity.\n2. Reversible anemia: Anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells or a lower than normal level of hemoglobin in the blood. In this context, \"reversible\" means that the anemia can be treated and resolved. Therefore, \"reversible anemia\" can also be considered a disease entity.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"hematologic toxicity\" and \"reversible anemia\"."},
