Abductor paralysis: This is a disease or medical condition that refers to the inability of a muscle to contract, leading to weakness or paralysis of the affected muscle.

It is a neurotoxin that works by blocking the nerve signals that cause muscle contractions.\n3. Adductor spasmodic dysphonia: This is a neurological disorder that affects the voice muscles in the larynx (voice box). It is characterized by involuntary spasms of the muscles that control the vocal cords, leading to intermittent voice breaks, weak voice, or a strained or strangled quality to the voice.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Abductor paralysis\n* Adductor spasmodic dysphonia"},
