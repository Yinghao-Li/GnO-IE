It is not a disease itself, but a condition related to pain.\n* inflammatory: This is an adjective describing a type of response from the body's immune system, often associated with disease or injury. In this context, it refers to a type of pain being studied.\n* neuropathic pain: This is a specific type of pain that results from damage to or dysfunction of the nervous system.\n\nDisease entities in the paragraph:\n\n1.
