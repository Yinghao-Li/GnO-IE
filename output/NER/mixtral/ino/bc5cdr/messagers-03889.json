Fibrinolytic syndromes are medical conditions characterized by the activation of the fibrinolytic system, which can lead to excessive breakdown of blood clots and bleeding. It is not a specific disease but a category of disorders.\n3. Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) is a medication used to prevent or treat excessive bleeding. It is not a disease.\n4. Arteriolar and capillary fibrin thrombi are medical conditions characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels. They are not specific diseases but rather symptoms or complications of other medical conditions.\n5. Thromboembolic phenomena are medical conditions characterized by the formation of blood clots that can travel and block blood vessels in other parts of the body. They are not specific diseases but rather symptoms or complications of other medical conditions.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)\n* Fibrinolytic syndromes (although not a specific disease, it is a category of disorders)\n* Thromboembolic phenomena (although not a specific disease, it is a symptom or complication of other medical conditions)"},
