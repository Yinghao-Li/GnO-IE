Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n * Intravascular hemolysis\n * acute renal failure\n * rifampin therapy\n2.

Verifying if they are diseases:\n * Intravascular hemolysis: a medical condition\n * acute renal failure: a medical condition\n * rifampin therapy: not a disease, but a treatment method\n\nThe identified diseases in the paragraph are:\n\n* Intravascular hemolysis\n* acute renal failure"},
