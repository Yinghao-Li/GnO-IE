CHOP: This is a transcription factor, also known as C/EBP homologous protein, that is involved in the regulation of gene expression. It is a marker for chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.\n3. ER stress: This is a condition that occurs when the endoplasmic reticulum, a cellular organelle involved in protein folding and processing, is overwhelmed by the demand for protein folding.\n4.
