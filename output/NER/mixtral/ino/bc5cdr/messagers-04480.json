It is a chemical in the sense that it is a molecule that plays a role in biological processes.\n2. IR: It could refer to Insulin Receptor, which is a protein that is activated by the hormone insulin to regulate glucose metabolism. It is a chemical because it is a molecule that plays a role in biological processes.\n3. CYP: It could refer to Cytochrome P450, which is a family of enzymes involved in drug metabolism and other chemical reactions in the body. It is a chemical because it is a molecule that plays a role in biological processes.\n4. 75 mg / kg: This is a dosage measurement, and the chemical being referred to is not explicitly stated, but it is likely that it is referring to a drug or compound that is being administered to the rats.\n5. i.p.: This is an abbreviation for \"intraperitoneal,\" which refers to a method of administration in which a substance is injected into the abdominal cavity. The chemical being referred to is not explicitly stated, but it is likely that it is the same chemical being administered in the dosage measurement mentioned earlier.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Fos, IR, CYP, and the unspecified chemical being administered to the rats in the dosage measurement and method of administration."},
