Serum: Although not a chemical itself, serum is a bodily fluid that can contain various chemicals, so it's often mentioned in the context of chemical measurements.\n3. Drug: This is a general term for any chemical substance that is used in the treatment of disease or medical conditions. In this context, it's referring to Levetiracetam.\n4. Concentrations: This term is used to describe the amount of a chemical substance present in a given volume of fluid, in this case, serum.\n5. Elimination half-life: This is a pharmacological term used to describe the time it takes for the concentration of a chemical substance (in this case, Levetiracetam) to be reduced by half in the body.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Levetiracetam, serum, drug (Levetiracetam), concentrations, and elimination half-life."},
