    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Cholecystokinin: This is a hormone that is produced in the duodenum and stimulates the release of bile and pancreatic enzymes. It is also involved in regulating appetite and satiety.\n2. Octapeptide: This is a type of peptide that consists of eight amino acids. In this context, \"octapeptide\" likely refers to a specific form of cholecystokinin that consists of eight amino acids.\n3. Morphine: This is a strong pain-relieving drug that is derived from the opium poppy. It works by binding to specific receptors in the brain and spinal cord, which blocks the transmission of pain signals.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the \"chemical\" entities are Cholecystokinin, octapeptide, and morphine."},
