Researching these terms:\n * \"GM\" usually stands for \"genetically modified,\" but in this context, it seems to be referring to a specific genetic modification or a genetic condition that leads to nephropathy.\n * \"Nephropathy\" is a general term for kidney disease or damage.\n\nBased on this analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. GM-mediated nephropathy\n\nPlease note that \"GM-mediated nephropathy\" is a more specific term for a kidney disease caused by a genetically modified factor, but it is not a widely recognized medical condition with a specific definition."},
