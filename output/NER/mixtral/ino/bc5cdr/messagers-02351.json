It is not a chemical, but a protein.\n2. NK1 receptor antagonists: NK1 receptors are a type of G protein-coupled receptor that binds substance P, a neuropeptide involved in pain transmission. NK1 receptor antagonists are drugs that block the activity of NK1 receptors. They are not chemicals, but pharmaceutical compounds.\n3. Cyclophosphamide: This is an alkylating agent used in chemotherapy to treat various types of cancer. It is also used as an immunosuppressive agent to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs.\n4. Cystitis: This is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the bladder.\n5. Rats: This is a type of rodent that is commonly used in laboratory experiments.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"cyclophosphamide\"."},
