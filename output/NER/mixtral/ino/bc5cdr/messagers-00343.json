Analyze the context and determine if they are being used to describe a disease or medical condition.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two medical conditions mentioned:\n\n1. Hepatic secretion of triglyceride: This refers to the release of triglycerides from the liver. While it's not a disease itself, impaired hepatic secretion of triglycerides can be a symptom or a contributing factor in certain diseases, such as fatty liver disease.\n2. Fatty liver: This is the accumulation of triglycerides in liver cells, which can lead to fatty liver disease if not addressed.\n\nBased on the context, the paragraph discusses the involvement of these medical conditions in the development of a triglyceride-rich fatty liver due to tetracycline exposure. Therefore, both 'hepatic secretion of triglyceride' and 'fatty liver' can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this context."},
