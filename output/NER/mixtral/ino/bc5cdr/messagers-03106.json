It is known to have cardiotoxic effects.\n2. Cytotoxicity assay: While not a chemical itself, this is a test used to measure the toxicity of a substance (in this case, aconitine) on cells (NRVMs).\n3. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs): These are heart muscle cells from newborn rats. They are not chemicals, but are mentioned in the context of the experiment.\n4. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): This is an enzyme found in many types of cells, including heart muscle cells. It is released when cells are damaged, so measuring its level in the culture medium can indicate the degree of cell damage or injury.\n5. Serum cardiac enzymes: These are enzymes found in the blood that are specific to heart muscle cells. They are often measured to diagnose and monitor heart disease or injury.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are aconitine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and serum cardiac enzymes."},
