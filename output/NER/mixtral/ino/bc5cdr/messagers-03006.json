While not a chemical itself, it often contains various chemical solutions such as saline or dextrose.\n2. Vasopressor therapy: This is a medical treatment that uses vasopressor drugs to constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure. Examples of vasopressors include norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine.\n3. Stress dose steroids: Steroids are a class of chemicals that can mimic the hormones produced by the adrenal gland. In this context, \"stress dose\" refers to a higher dose of steroids given to patients under stress or who have stopped producing their own steroids. Common steroids used in medicine include hydrocortisone, prednisone, and dexamethasone.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Intravenous fluids (which may contain various chemical solutions)\n* Vasopressor drugs (such as norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine)\n* Steroids (such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, and dexamethasone)"},
