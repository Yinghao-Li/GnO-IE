Analyze each potential chemical entity to confirm if it is a chemical.\n\nStep 1: The potential chemical entities in the text are \"apigenin\" and \"60%\".\n\nStep 2:\n\n* \"Apigenin\" is a chemical compound found in plants that belongs to a class of compounds called flavonoids. It has various potential health benefits, such as anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, \"apigenin\" is a chemical.\n* \"60%\" is a percentage, which is a dimensionless number used to express a ratio or proportion. It is not a chemical.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"apigenin\"."},
