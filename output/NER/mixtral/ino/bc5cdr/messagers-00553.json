Intraperitoneal injection: While not a chemical itself, this is a method of administering a chemical substance (in this case, indomethacin) into the body.\n3. 20 mg/kg: This is a dosage measurement for the high-dose group, where the chemical indomethacin is administered at a concentration of 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.\n4. Oral indomethacin: This refers to the method of administering indomethacin orally, as opposed to intraperitoneal injection.\n5. 3.25 mg/kg body weight: This is a dosage measurement for the therapeutic dose group, where the chemical indomethacin is administered at a concentration of 3.25 milligrams per kilogram of body weight daily for 3 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are indomethacin, intraperitoneal injection (as a method of administering indomethacin), and the dosage measurements 20 mg/kg and 3.25 mg/kg body weight."},
