Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related words or phrases:\n\n* histamine antagonists\n* hypotension\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the context:\n\n* Histamine antagonists are a type of medication used to treat various conditions such as allergies and gastrointestinal disorders. They are not a disease.\n* Hypotension refers to abnormally low blood pressure. It can be a symptom of various diseases or conditions, but in this context, it is being used as a medical condition itself.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Hypotension\n\nNote: The other term, \"histamine antagonists,\" is a type of medication, not a disease."},
