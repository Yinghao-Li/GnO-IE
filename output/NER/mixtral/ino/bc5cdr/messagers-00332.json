It is a type of enzyme that helps break down potentially harmful oxygen molecules in cells, which can prevent damage to DNA and other cell components.\n2. Oxidant stress: This is a chemical process that occurs when there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful molecules or repair the damage they cause.\n3. Aminoglycosides: These are a group of antibiotics that are used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. They include drugs such as gentamicin, tobramycin, and neomycin. Aminoglycosides can be toxic to the ear, leading to hearing loss and balance problems.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are superoxide dismutase, oxidant stress, and aminoglycosides."},
