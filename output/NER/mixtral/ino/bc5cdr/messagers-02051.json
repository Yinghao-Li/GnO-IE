Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. Neuroinflammation: This is a biological process, not a chemical. It refers to the inflammation of the nervous tissue, often as a response to injury or disease.\n2. Seizures: This is a medical condition, not a chemical. It refers to abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can cause various symptoms, such as convulsions, loss of consciousness, or altered behavior.\n3. Epileptogenesis: This is another medical/biological term, not a chemical. It refers to the process by which a normal brain becomes susceptible to recurrent seizures, leading to epilepsy.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"chemical\" entities in this paragraph."},
