Acute renal failure is a condition characterized by the sudden loss of kidney function, which can lead to the accumulation of waste products in the blood.\n2. High-dose methotrexate therapy: While this is not a disease per se, it is a medical treatment that can have adverse effects, such as acute renal failure. Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat various types of cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"Acute renal failure\" and \"high-dose methotrexate therapy\" (although the latter is a treatment that can cause the former). The mention of \"ileostomy\" in the paragraph refers to a surgical procedure, not a disease."},
