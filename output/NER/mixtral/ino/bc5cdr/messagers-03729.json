Convulsions - This is a disease entity, which refers to involuntary contractions of muscles that lead to uncontrollable shaking or trembling.\n2. Pilocarpine - Although not explicitly stated as a disease, it is a medication used to induce experimental status epilepticus (a condition of prolonged seizures) in research. In this context, it is used to produce a disease-like state, i.e., convulsions.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"convulsions\" and \"status epilepticus\" (induced by pilocarpine)."},
