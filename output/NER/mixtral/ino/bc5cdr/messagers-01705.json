However, the paragraph only describes the condition of the glomeruli and does not explicitly mention any kidney disease. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that \"glomeruli\" is a disease entity in this context.\n2. Membrane spikes: Membrane spikes are a characteristic feature of membranous nephropathy, a kidney disease that affects the glomeruli. Therefore, we can consider \"membrane spikes\" as a disease entity in this context.\n3. Prominent swelling of podocytes: Prominent swelling of podocytes is a characteristic feature of several kidney diseases, including minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranous nephropathy. Therefore, we can consider \"prominent swelling of podocytes\" as a disease entity in this context.\n4. Subepithelial deposits: Subepithelial deposits are a characteristic feature of membranous nephropathy, a kidney disease that affects the glomeruli. Therefore, we can consider \"subepithelial deposits\" as a disease entity in this context.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"membranous nephropathy\" (implied by the description of membrane spikes and subepithelial deposits), and to some extent, other kidney diseases that can cause prominent swelling of podocytes."},
