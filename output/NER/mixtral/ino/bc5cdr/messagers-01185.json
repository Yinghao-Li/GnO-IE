It is an abbreviation for \"left ventricle\" in this context.\n* TGR: It is not a chemical entity. It is an abbreviation for \"transgenic rat\" in this context.\n* SD: It is not a chemical entity. It is an abbreviation for \"Sprague Dawley rat\" in this context.\n* beta - AR: It is a chemical entity. It is an abbreviation for \"beta-adrenergic receptor.\"\n* LV beta - AR kinase - 1 mRNA: It is a chemical entity.
