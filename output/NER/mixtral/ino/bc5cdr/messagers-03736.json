Possible disease-related phrases: \"failing hearts\", \"heart transplant\", \"rheumatic disease\", \"myxomatous degeneration\".\n2. Analyzing each phrase:\n * \"failing hearts\" - This phrase likely refers to a condition or state of the heart, not a specific disease.\n * \"heart transplant\" - This is a medical procedure, not a disease.\n * \"rheumatic disease\" - This is a general term for a group of diseases affecting the joints, connective tissues, or heart, so it refers to a disease.\n * \"myxomatous degeneration\" - This is a specific heart valve disorder, so it refers to a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Rheumatic disease\n* Myxomatous degeneration"},
