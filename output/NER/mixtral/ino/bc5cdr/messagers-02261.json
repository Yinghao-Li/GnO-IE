Serum: While not a chemical itself, serum refers to the fluid part of blood that remains after clotting, which contains various chemicals such as proteins, electrolytes, and antibodies.\n3. CSF: This stands for cerebrospinal fluid, which is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord and contains various chemicals such as glucose, proteins, and electrolytes.\n4. Trough concentrations: This refers to the lowest concentration of a drug in the blood or fluid (in this case, serum or CSF) after a dose has been administered and the drug has reached its lowest level before the next dose is given.\n5. Ug/mL: This is a unit of measurement for concentration, with \"ug\" standing for micrograms and \"mL\" standing for milliliters.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Daptomycin, serum, CSF, and the units of measurement ug/mL."},
