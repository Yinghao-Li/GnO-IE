Research and analyze the terms to determine if they refer to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph, the potential medical terms are:\n\n* Ventricular arrhythmias\n* Ventricular tachycardia\n\nAfter researching and analyzing these terms, we can determine that:\n\n* Ventricular arrhythmias: This term refers to abnormal heart rhythms that originate in the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart. It is a general term that includes various types of arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia.\n* Ventricular tachycardia: This is a specific type of ventricular arrhythmia characterized by a rapid heart rate originating from the ventricles. It can be a serious condition that may lead to further complications, such as ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ventricular arrhythmias\n2. Ventricular tachycardia"},
