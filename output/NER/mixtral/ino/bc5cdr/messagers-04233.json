Although not a disease itself, it can cause or contribute to certain diseases, especially muscle-related ones, as mentioned in the text.\n* degenerative changes: This phrase generally refers to the progressive deterioration of tissues or organs due to disease or aging. It implies the presence of an underlying disease or condition causing these changes.\n* especially in the muscles: This specifies the location of the degenerative changes caused by vitamin E deficiency, suggesting potential muscle-related diseases or conditions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Vitamin E deficiency\n2. Degenerative changes in the muscles (implied)"},
