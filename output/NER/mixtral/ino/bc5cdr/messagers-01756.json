It is a medication used to treat various conditions such as high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and certain types of tremors.\n2. Fatty acid mobilization: While not a specific chemical, fatty acids are a type of chemical compound. However, in this context, \"fatty acid mobilization\" refers to a biological process and not a specific chemical entity.\n3. Lactate: This is a chemical entity. It is a chemical compound that is produced during the breakdown of glucose in the body.\n4. Glucose: This is a chemical entity. It is a simple sugar that is a primary source of energy for living organisms.\n5. Glycerol: This is a chemical entity. It is a simple alcohol that is a component of fats and oils.\n6. Triglycerides: This is a chemical entity. It is a type of fat that is found in the blood and in the body's cells.\n7. Insulin: This is a chemical entity. It is a hormone that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood.\n8. Epinephrine: This is a chemical entity. It is a hormone and neurotransmitter that is produced by the adrenal glands.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Propranolol, lactate, glucose, glycerol, triglycerides, insulin, and epinephrine."},
