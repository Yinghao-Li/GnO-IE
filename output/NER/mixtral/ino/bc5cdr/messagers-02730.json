The paragraph is discussing the neurological and radiological late effects in children who were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) P9605 (standard risk) and P9201 (lesser risk) protocols.\n2. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. Therefore, ALL is a \"Disease\" entity in this paragraph.\n3. The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) P9605 and P9201 protocols are treatment plans for children with ALL. While they are not diseases themselves, they are related to the disease ALL.\n4. The paragraph also mentions \"neurocognitive and neuroradiologic central nervous system late effects,\" which are conditions that can occur as a result of the treatment for ALL. Therefore, these late effects can also be considered \"Disease\" entities.\n\nTo summarize, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\n* Neurocognitive and neuroradiologic central nervous system late effects."},

Neurocognitive and neuroradiologic: These are medical terms that describe certain conditions or effects on the brain and nervous system, but they do not refer to specific chemicals.\n4. Central nervous system: This is an anatomical term that refers to the brain and spinal cord. It does not refer to a specific chemical.\n5. Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) P9605 and P9201: These are likely names of specific clinical trials or treatment protocols, and do not refer to specific chemicals.\n6. Late effects: This is a medical term that refers to the long-term or persistent effects of a medical treatment, but it does not refer to a specific chemical.\n7. Children: This is a demographic term and does not refer to a specific chemical.\n8. Standard risk and lesser risk: These are terms used to describe the likelihood of a particular outcome in a medical context, and do not refer to specific chemicals."},
