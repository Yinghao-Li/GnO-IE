This can lead to serious heart rhythm problems.\n\nSo, the only \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is \"QT prolongation\"."},

Cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors: These are a class of chemicals that inhibit the activity of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 enzyme, which is involved in drug metabolism. Examples of such inhibitors include some antifungal and antidepressant medications.\n3. Potassium level: Potassium is a chemical element (symbol K on the periodic table) and its level in the body can be a factor in QT prolongation.\n4. Liver function: While not a specific chemical, liver function is closely tied to the metabolism of various chemicals and drugs in the body, so it is relevant in the context of this paragraph."},
