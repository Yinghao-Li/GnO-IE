It has various effects on metabolism, immune response, and stress response.\n\nIn the given paragraph, glucocorticoid is used in the context of a murine model of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. Therefore, it is a chemical entity in this paragraph.\n\n2. Glaucoma: While glaucoma is a medical condition and not a chemical, it is often associated with certain chemicals or substances that can cause or contribute to its development. In this case, glaucoma is used to describe a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.\n\nTherefore, while glaucoma itself is not a chemical entity, it is relevant to the chemical entity glucocorticoid in the given paragraph.\n\n3. Patients: This term refers to individuals who have been diagnosed with a medical condition, in this case, glaucoma. It does not refer to a chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the given paragraph are glucocorticoid."},
