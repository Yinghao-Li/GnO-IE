The first disease entity in the paragraph is \"hepatic hypoperfusion.\" Hepatic hypoperfusion refers to reduced blood flow to the liver, which can lead to liver damage or failure.\n2. The second disease entity is \"heart failure.\" Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to a variety of symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid buildup in the body.\n\nThere are no other disease entities explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. However, it's worth noting that \"renal dysfunction\" could be considered a disease entity, as it refers to impaired kidney function. However, the paragraph specifically states that reduced doses are unnecessary for renal dysfunction, so it may not be appropriate to classify it as a disease entity in this context."},
