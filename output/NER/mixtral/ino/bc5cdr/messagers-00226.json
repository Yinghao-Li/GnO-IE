High blood pressure: This is a disease where the force of blood against the walls of your arteries is consistently too high. In the paragraph, it is referred to as \"blood pressure < 120 mm Hg.\"\n3. Increased creatinine: While creatinine is a chemical waste product in the blood that comes from normal muscle breakdown, elevated levels can indicate kidney disease or other medical problems. In the paragraph, it is referred to as \"creatinine, > or = 132.6 micromol/L [> or = 1.5 mg/dL].\"\n4. Age-related conditions: The paragraph mentions patients who are > or = 70 years old as being at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance. While aging itself is not a disease, certain medical conditions are more common in older adults.\n5. Diabetes: This is a disease where your blood sugar levels are too high. It is referred to in the paragraph as \"patients with diabetes.\"\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are high blood pressure, increased creatinine, age-related conditions, and diabetes."},
