The text discusses the effects of certain peptides and drugs (hypotension, glibenclamide, levcromakalim) on arterial blood pressure, but these are not considered diseases. Hypotension refers to abnormally low blood pressure, but it is a symptom rather than a disease itself. Therefore, there are no disease entities in this paragraph."},
