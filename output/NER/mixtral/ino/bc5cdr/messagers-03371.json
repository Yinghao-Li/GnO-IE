In this case, the paragraph is discussing a statistical analysis of cancer rates in relation to exposure to some agent.\n2. The paragraph mentions \"exposure\" and \"cancer sites,\" but it does not explicitly name any chemicals.\n3. However, the fact that the paragraph is discussing exposure suggests that there is likely a chemical or environmental factor that people are being exposed to.\n4. The paragraph mentions \"lifetime (LT) exposure days\" and \"intensity-weighted (IW) lifetime exposure days,\" which imply that there is a measurable quantity of exposure that is being studied.\n5.
