Analyze each word or phrase to determine if it represents a chemical.\n\nIn the paragraph \"No significant changes in plasma concentrations of electrolytes were found.\", the potential chemical entities are:\n\n* Plasma\n* Electrolytes\n\nNow let's analyze each one:\n\n1. Plasma: Plasma is a component of blood, but it is not a chemical itself. It is a biological fluid, so it does not qualify as a chemical entity in this context.\n2. Electrolytes: Electrolytes are chemical substances that, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions and acquire the capacity to conduct electricity. Examples of electrolytes include sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate ions. In this context, electrolytes are indeed chemical entities.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entity in the paragraph is \"electrolytes.\""},
