RRMM - This stands for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma, which is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow.\n2. RD - The context of the paragraph does not provide enough information to determine what RD stands for specifically. However, it is mentioned in the context of being administered to patients, so it likely refers to some sort of medical treatment or therapy.\n3. The third disease entity is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred. The paragraph refers to \"RW,\" which likely stands for \"real world\" or \"routine clinical practice\" setting. In this context, it is implied that the patients who received RD (treatment) were likely suffering from various diseases or conditions, one of which is RRMM. Therefore, the unspecified disease entities would be the various conditions or diseases that the 212 RRMM patients were also suffering from, aside from RRMM."},
