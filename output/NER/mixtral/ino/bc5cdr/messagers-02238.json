It is not a chemical in the traditional sense, but it is a chemical disturbance or electrolyte imbalance.\n2.

They work by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.\n3. Spironolactone: This is a medication used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and other conditions. It is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it helps the body eliminate excess fluid while preserving potassium levels.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are hyperkalemia, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and spironolactone."},
