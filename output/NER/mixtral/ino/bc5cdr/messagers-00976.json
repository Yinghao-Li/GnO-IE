Diuretic use (not a disease itself, but a treatment for various conditions such as heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease)\n5.

Hypoalbuminemia: This is a medical condition characterized by low levels of albumin in the blood. Albumin is a type of protein, so hypoalbuminemia can be considered a chemical entity.\n3. Heavy proteinuria: This is a medical condition characterized by excessive amounts of protein in the urine. Protein is a chemical compound, so heavy proteinuria can be considered a chemical entity.\n4. Diuretic use: Diuretics are a type of medication that increases urine production. While diuretics themselves are not chemical entities, they are related to the chemical process of urine production.\n5. Urine sediment score (> 3): This refers to the amount of solid material present in a urine sample. Solid materials in urine can include various chemical compounds, so this can be considered a chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are hypoalbuminemia, heavy proteinuria, and the solid materials present in urine (referred to as urine sediment score)."},
