Analyze each potential chemical entity to confirm if it is indeed a chemical.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the potential chemical entities are:\n\n1. Blood pressure\n2. GTN (prehospital GTN administration)\n\nNow, let's analyze each potential chemical entity:\n\n1. Blood pressure: Blood pressure is a measure of the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. It is not a chemical, but rather a physiological parameter.\n2. GTN (Glyceryl Trinitrate): GTN is a medication commonly used to treat heart conditions, such as angina or heart failure. It is a chemical compound with the formula C2H5(NO3)3. GTN works by relaxing and widening blood vessels, which reduces the workload on the heart and improves blood flow.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is GTN (Glyceryl Trinitrate)."},
