Analyze the context to ensure the terms are indeed referring to diseases or medical conditions.\n\nIn this paragraph, there are two potential \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. The first one is related to the exposure of animals to BCNU during pregnancy. BCNU, or carmustine, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat brain tumors and other cancers. However, it's not explicitly stated that it causes a disease. Instead, it leads to delayed maturation of the offspring cerebellum. Delayed maturation is a symptom or effect, not a disease itself.\n2. The second potential disease entity is melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. It doesn't refer to a disease or medical condition.\n\nTherefore, there are no clear \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},
