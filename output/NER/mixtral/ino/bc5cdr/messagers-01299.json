Prox-1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of granule cells in the cerebellum.\n\nExplanation: Prox-1 is a specific type of protein that functions as a transcription factor, which means it regulates the expression of genes in the cell. It is mentioned as a \"granule-cell-specific marker,\" indicating that it is used to identify a specific type of nerve cell, the granule cell, in the cerebellum."},
