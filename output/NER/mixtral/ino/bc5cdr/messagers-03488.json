It is not a specific disease but a description of a symptom pattern. Therefore, it does not represent a disease entity.\n2. hepatic injury: This phrase refers to damage to the liver. Hepatic injury can be a result of various diseases, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Therefore, while not a disease itself, hepatic injury indicates an underlying disease process affecting the liver.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the various diseases that can cause hepatic injury.
