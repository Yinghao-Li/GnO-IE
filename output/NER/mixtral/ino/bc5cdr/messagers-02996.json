Cardiotoxicity: While not a chemical, it is important to note that this term refers to a condition caused by chemical substances or drugs, in this case, doxorubicin.\n3. Oxidative stress: This is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and the body's ability to detoxify or repair the resulting damage. It is a result of various chemical reactions in the body.\n4. Mitochondrial dysfunction: This refers to the disruption of normal mitochondrial function due to various factors, including chemical exposure or genetic mutations. In this context, it is a result of the cardiotoxicity caused by doxorubicin.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Doxorubicin, Oxidative stress, and indirectly, the reactive oxygen species (free radicals) that cause oxidative stress."},
