However, in this context, it is likely being used to refer to a specific type of myosin heavy chain that is genetically modified, so it can be considered a chemical entity.\n2. CB7: It is a specific type of transgene that expresses dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes. Transgenes are segments of DNA that are inserted into an organism's genome, and they can be considered chemical entities.\n3. DOX: It stands for Doxorubicin, which is an anthracycline antibiotic used in cancer chemotherapy. It is a chemical entity used as a drug in this experiment.\n4. 25 mg/kg: It is a dosage measurement, where mg stands for milligrams and kg stands for kilograms. It is a chemical quantity and can be considered a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are MHC, CB7, DOX, and 25 mg/kg."},
