Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of three amino acids: cysteine, glutamic acid, and glycine. It plays a crucial role in antioxidant defense, nutrient metabolism, and regulation of cellular events.\n3. Intestinal ischemia - reperfusion injury: This refers to a complex physiological process involving chemical reactions, but the entities \"intestinal ischemia\" and \"reperfusion injury\" are not specific chemical compounds. Ischemia refers to the restriction of blood supply to tissues, while reperfusion injury occurs when blood supply returns to the tissue after a period of ischemia, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species and inflammation."},
