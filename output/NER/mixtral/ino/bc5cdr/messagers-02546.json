Research or analyze the context of these words or phrases to determine if they indeed refer to a disease.\n\nApplying this process to the given paragraph:\n\n1. The potential disease-related words or phrases in the paragraph are \"HIT type II\" and \"thrombocytopenia\" (although the term \"thrombocytopenia\" does not appear in the paragraph, it is a possible complication of HIT type II).\n2. Now, let's analyze the context of \"HIT type II\". HIT stands for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia, which is a condition where the body forms antibodies against heparin, leading to a decrease in platelet count and an increased risk of blood clots. Therefore, \"HIT type II\" indeed refers to a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* HIT type II (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia type II)"},
