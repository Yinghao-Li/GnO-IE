Research or use prior knowledge to determine if these entities can be classified as diseases.\n\nIn the paragraph \"Invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis following cyclophosphamide therapy for nonmalignant disease,\" we can identify the following potential disease-related entities:\n\n1. Invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis\n2. nonmalignant disease\n\nNow, let's determine if these entities can be classified as diseases:\n\n1. Invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis: This is a type of cancer that affects the renal pelvis, which is the part of the kidney where urine collects before flowing into the ureter. It is a disease since it is an abnormal growth or spread of malignant cells.\n2. nonmalignant disease: This term refers to any disease that is not cancerous or malignant. It can include a wide range of medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis. Therefore, it is also a disease.\n\nConclusion: Both \"Invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis\" and \"nonmalignant disease\" are disease entities in the given paragraph."},
