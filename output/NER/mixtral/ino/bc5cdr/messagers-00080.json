Pharmacological stress: This refers to the use of medication to induce a physiological response similar to exercise, often used in stress testing to evaluate heart function. Here, \"pharmacological\" is the chemical entity, as it refers to a medication or drug.\n2. Left ventricular dysfunction: This is a medical condition where the left ventricle of the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently. While not a chemical itself, this condition is often associated with various chemical substances, such as cardiac biomarkers or medications used to treat heart conditions.\n3. Coronary artery disease: This is a condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of cholesterol, fat, and other substances. The chemical entities in this context are cholesterol and fat, which are substances that can accumulate and cause blockages in the coronary arteries.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Pharmacological (referring to medication or drugs)\n* Cholesterol\n* Fat"},
