In the given paragraph, the term \"5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity\" is the disease entity.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The potential medical conditions or diseases in the text are \"5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity\" and \"high serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL)\".\n2. \"5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity\" refers to a condition where the heart is damaged due to the administration of 5-FU (5-fluorouracil), a chemotherapeutic agent. Therefore, it is a disease entity.\n3. \"High serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL)\" is not a disease but a laboratory finding or a symptom. It is a metabolic byproduct of 5-FU and may indicate impaired 5-FU metabolism or clearance.\n\nHence, the disease entity in the paragraph is \"5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity\"."},

In the given paragraph, the term \"5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity\" is the relevant disease entity.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The potential medical conditions or diseases in the text are \"5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity\" and, potentially, \"cardiotoxicity\".\n2. \"5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity\" refers to a condition where the heart is damaged due to the administration of 5-FU (5-fluorouracil), a chemotherapeutic agent. Therefore, it is a disease entity.\n3. \"Cardiotoxicity\" is a broad term that refers to the toxic effect of a substance on the heart. In this context, it is directly related to the administration of 5-FU, so it can be inferred that \"cardiotoxicity\" here specifically refers to \"5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity\".\n\nIrrelevant entities in the text include \"a 70-year-old man\", \"high serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL)\", and \"alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL)\". These terms do not directly refer to diseases.\n\nTherefore, the relevant disease entity in the paragraph is \"5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity\"."},
