Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph \"Chronic lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla in spontaneously hypertensive rats,\" the potential disease-related phrases are:\n\n* Chronic lesion\n* Spontaneously hypertensive rats\n\nNow, let's analyze the context:\n\n* Chronic lesion: A lesion is a damage or abnormal change in the bodily tissue. While not a disease itself, a chronic lesion indicates a long-term issue or condition affecting the tissue.\n* Spontaneously hypertensive rats: Hypertension refers to high blood pressure. In this context, it is used to describe a specific strain of rats that naturally (spontaneously) develop high blood pressure.\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypertension\n\nAlthough not explicitly mentioned as a disease, spontaneous hypertension in rats is a model for studying high blood pressure, a well-known disease in humans."},
