Encephalopathy: While not a chemical, encephalopathy is a medical condition that can be caused by various chemical substances, including medications like phenytoin.\n3. Seizures: Seizures are not chemical entities, but they can be a symptom of exposure to certain chemicals or chemical imbalances in the brain.\n4.
