    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Cortical laminar necrosis: This refers to the death of cells in the outer layer (cortex) of the brain. Necrosis is a type of cell death that results from interruption of the blood supply to the cells. It is not a chemical, but rather a pathological condition.\n2. Arterial border zones: These are the areas in the brain where the blood supply from two or more arteries meets. They are also known as watershed areas. They are not chemicals either, but rather anatomical structures.\n3. Ischemic changes: Ischemia refers to a lack of blood flow to an organ or tissue, leading to tissue damage. In this context, ischemic changes refer to the damage caused by lack of blood flow to the brain tissue. It is not a chemical.\n4. Subcortical white matter: This refers to the area of the brain beneath the cortex that contains nerve fibers (axons) that transmit signals between different parts of the brain. It is not a chemical.\n5. Left cerebral hemisphere: This refers to the left half of the brain, which controls the right side of the body. It is not a chemical.\n6. Left putamen: The putamen is a part of the basal ganglia, a group of structures deep within the brain that are involved in movement control. The putamen is not a chemical.\n\nTherefore, there are no chemical entities in the given paragraph."},
