Ca2+: This represents the calcium ion, a crucial signaling molecule in biological systems.\n3. Annexin V binding: Annexin V is a protein that binds to phosphatidylserine, a type of phospholipid found in the cell membrane. This binding is often used as an indicator of apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n4. Forward scatter: This is a term used in flow cytometry to describe the size and granularity of cells.\n\nSo, the \"chemical\" entities in the paragraph are azathioprine, Ca2+, and annexin V binding. While forward scatter is not a chemical entity itself, it is related to the granularity of cells, which can be influenced by various chemical and biological processes."},
