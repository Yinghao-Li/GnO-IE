Heparin is a common blood thinner used in medical procedures and treatment.\n2. Thrombocytopenia is a medical condition characterized by a lower than normal number of platelets, which are blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding.\n3. Thrombosis is a condition in which a blood clot forms inside a blood vessel and blocks the flow of blood through the circulatory system.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT)\n* Thrombocytopenia\n* Thrombosis"},
