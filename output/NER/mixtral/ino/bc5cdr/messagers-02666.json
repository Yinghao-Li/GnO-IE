DOX: This is a chemical entity, an abbreviation for the chemical compound Doxorubicin.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Oxidative stress\" refers to a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and the body's ability to detoxify these reactive products. It is a biological process and not a chemical entity.\n* \"Multiple dose\" is a term used to describe the administration of a medication or treatment multiple times. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nHence, the only relevant chemical entity in the paragraph is \"DOX\", which is an abbreviation for the chemical compound Doxorubicin."},
