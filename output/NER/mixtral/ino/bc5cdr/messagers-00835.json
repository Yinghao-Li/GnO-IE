Hepatic: This term refers to the liver, but it is not a chemical entity.\n3. Lipid: This is a chemical entity. Lipids are a diverse group of molecules that are insoluble in water and include fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins, monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, and phospholipids.\n4. Homeostasis: This is a biological term that refers to the stable conditions that are maintained in an organism or cell by various regulatory processes. It is not a chemical entity.\n5. PPARalpha: This is a chemical entity. PPARalpha is a type of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, which is a type of nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.\n6. Target genes: This is a biological term that refers to the genes that are regulated by a particular transcription factor or regulatory protein. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are amiodarone, lipid, and PPARalpha."},
