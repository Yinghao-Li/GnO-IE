Monoclonal gammapathy of undetermined significance: This is a condition where there is an abnormal protein in the blood, but it is not causing any symptoms or harm. It is called \"of undetermined significance\" because it is not clear if it will develop into a more serious condition.\n3. Proteinuria: This is a symptom, not a disease, but it is included here because it is relevant to the context of the paragraph. Proteinuria is the presence of excess protein in the urine, which can be a sign of kidney damage or disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Amyloidosis and Kidney disease (implied by the symptom of proteinuria)."},
