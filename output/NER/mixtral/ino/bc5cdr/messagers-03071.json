It is often used in medical settings as a diuretic to prevent kidney damage or to reduce pressure in the eye. In the given paragraph, mannitol is mentioned as a substance that should be preferentially given to patients at high risk of nephrotoxicity, which is kidney toxicity caused by certain medications or medical conditions."},
