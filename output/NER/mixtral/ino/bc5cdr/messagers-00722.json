LNAA (large neutral amino acid): This is also a chemical entity. It is a group of amino acids that includes phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine, methionine, and the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine.\n3. Levodopa: This is a chemical entity. It is a precursor to the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. It is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\n4. Blood-brain barrier: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a specialized system of cells that separates the brain from the rest of the body. It allows the passage of certain substances, such as water, oxygen, and glucose, while blocking the passage of others, such as large molecules and toxins.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are phenylalanine, LNAA, and levodopa."},
