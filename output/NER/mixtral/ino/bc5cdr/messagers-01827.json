Analyze each term to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related terms in the paragraph:\n\n* HIT (not expanded in the text, but it stands for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia, which is a disease)\n* hepatic impairment (a condition that can be considered a disease)\n* paediatric patients (refers to children, who can have various diseases)\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each term:\n\n* HIT: It is a disease, specifically an adverse reaction to heparin therapy, which results in a decrease in platelet count and an increased risk of thrombosis.\n* hepatic impairment: This term refers to a reduced liver function due to various causes, such as liver diseases (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatitis).\n* paediatric patients: While not a disease itself, this term refers to a group of individuals (children) who can have various diseases.\n\nConclusion: The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)\n2. Hepatic impairment\n3. (Implied) Various diseases that can affect paediatric patients"},
