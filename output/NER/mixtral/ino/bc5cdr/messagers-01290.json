    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Acidification: This is a chemical process that involves the increase in the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) in a solution, leading to a lower pH.\n2. CAA: This is likely referring to a specific chemical compound, but without additional context, I cannot provide a specific identification.\n3. Thiol donors: Thiols are a class of chemical compounds that contain a sulfhydryl group (-SH). Donors in this context likely refer to chemicals that can donate a thiol group in a reaction.\n4. Necrosis markers: These are likely specific chemical compounds or indicators used to measure or identify necrosis, a form of cell death.\n5. Thiol depletion: This is a chemical process that involves the reduction of thiol groups in a system.\n6. Cysteine protease inhibition: Cysteine proteases are a class of enzymes that cut other proteins. Inhibition in this context likely refers to the use of a chemical compound to block or reduce the activity of these enzymes.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Acidification, CAA, Thiol donors, Necrosis markers, Thiol depletion, and Cysteine protease inhibition."},
