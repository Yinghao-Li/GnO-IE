It is a colorless liquid at room temperature that is a strong oxidizing agent.\n2. Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) - This is a method used to measure the antioxidant capacity of plasma. It involves the reduction of ferric ions (Fe3+) to ferrous ions (Fe2+) by antioxidants present in the plasma. While FRAP itself is not a chemical entity, it is a method that measures the reducing capacity of antioxidants, which are chemical compounds.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and antioxidants (which are reduced to ferrous ions in the FRAP assay)."},
