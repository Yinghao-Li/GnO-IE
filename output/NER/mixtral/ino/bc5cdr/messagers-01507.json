Research each word or phrase to determine if it is a disease.\n\nStep 1: The paragraph mentions antibodies against two proteins, GFAP and S-100 protein. There are no other words or phrases that directly refer to diseases.\n\nStep 2: Researching GFAP and S-100 protein, we find that they are not diseases themselves but are associated with certain medical conditions.\n\nGFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) is a type III intermediate filament protein found in astrocytes, a type of neuroglial cell in the central nervous system. Increased GFAP levels are associated with various neurological disorders, such as:\n\n* Astrogliosis, a non-specific response of astrocytes to brain injury or disease\n* Alexander disease, a rare genetic disorder affecting the central nervous system\n* Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder\n* Traumatic brain injury\n\nS-100 protein is a calcium-binding protein found in various tissues, including the brain. Increased S-100 protein levels are associated with certain medical conditions, such as:\n\n* Brain injury or trauma\n* Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases\n* Epilepsy\n* Malignant tumors, such as astrocytomas and melanomas\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Astrogliosis\n2. Alexander disease\n3. Alzheimer's disease\n4. Traumatic brain injury\n5. Epilepsy\n6. Astrocytomas\n7. Melanomas"},
