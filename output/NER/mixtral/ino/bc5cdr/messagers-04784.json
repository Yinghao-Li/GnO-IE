It is a specific peptide isolated from the venom of a lizard's salivary gland.\n2. venom: This is also a chemical entity. It is a complex mixture of chemicals, including peptides, proteins, and other compounds, produced by an animal for defensive purposes.\n3. lizard salivary gland: While not a chemical itself, this is the source of the venom that contains the peptide helodermin.\n4. ATP sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels: These are chemical entities. They are a type of ion channel that is sensitive to the presence of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a molecule that is involved in energy transfer in cells.\n5. ATP: This is a chemical entity. It is a nucleotide that is involved in energy transfer in cells.\n6. K+: This is a chemical entity. It is the symbol for potassium ions, which are important for many physiological processes, including the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are: helodermin, venom, ATP sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels, ATP, and K+."},
