However, I would be happy to analyze a different paragraph for chemical entities.\n\nParagraph: 2.\n\nThe human body is made up of many different types of cells, including muscle cells, nerve cells, and blood cells. Muscle cells contain a protein called actin, which helps them contract and relax. Nerve cells, on the other hand, contain a chemical called neurotransmitters, which allow them to communicate with each other. Blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin, which helps them carry oxygen throughout the body.\n\nRevised Paragraph:\n\nThe human body is made up of [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)). [Muscle cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_cell) contain [actin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin), a [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein).
