Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a condition where heparin use leads to a decrease in platelet count, and thrombosis refers to the formation of blood clots. Other side effects of heparin therapy can also be considered a disease entity, as it indicates various adverse effects that can occur due to heparin treatment."},
