It is a type of anticholinergic drug, which means it blocks the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous system.\n2. Pentobarbital: This is a barbiturate medication that is used as a sedative, hypnotic, or anticonvulsant. It works by slowing down the activity of the brain and nervous system.\n3. Pilocarpine: This is a medication that is used to treat glaucoma, a condition that causes increased pressure in the eye. It works by causing the eye to produce more fluid, which helps to lower the pressure.\n4. MK-801: This is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist that is used in research to study the role of the NMDA receptor in various physiological processes. It is not used as a medication in humans.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Scopolamine, Pentobarbital, Pilocarpine, and MK-801."},
