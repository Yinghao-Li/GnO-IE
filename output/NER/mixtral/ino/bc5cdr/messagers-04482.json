Chronic CYP administration: This refers to the administration of a substance called CYP, but it does not necessarily indicate a disease.\n2. Increased bladder weight: This could be a symptom or a sign of a disease, but without further context, it is not possible to definitively call it a disease.\n3.

NOS: NOS stands for Nitric Oxide Synthase, which is an enzyme that produces nitric oxide, a signaling molecule in the body.\n4. NOS-immunoreactive (IR) afferent neurons: NOS-immunoreactive refers to neurons that have been identified as having NOS through immunohistochemical staining. Afferent neurons are sensory neurons that transmit signals from the periphery to the central nervous system.\n5. L6-S1 DRG: L6-S1 DRG stands for Lumbar 6-Sacral 1 Dorsal Root Ganglion, which is a cluster of sensory neurons located near the spinal cord.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are CYP (if its full form is a chemical compound or drug), Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS), and nitric oxide (implied by NOS)."},
