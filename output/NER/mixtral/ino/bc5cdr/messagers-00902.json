It can indicate various heart conditions, such as myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n2. \"myocardial ischemia\" - Although not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, it is implied in the context of ST elevation. Myocardial ischemia refers to a lack of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle, which can lead to heart damage if not treated promptly.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"ST elevation\" and \"myocardial ischemia.\""},
