Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: This is a complex set of interactions among three endocrine glands: the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal glands. It plays a crucial role in the body's response to stress.\n2. Ecstasy: Also known as MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), ecstasy is a psychoactive drug primarily used for recreational purposes. It is a synthetic, psychoactive drug with a chemical structure similar to the stimulant methamphetamine and the hallucinogen mescaline.\n3. Polydrug users: This term refers to individuals who use more than one drug simultaneously or in close succession. In this context, it relates to recreational users who consume ecstasy along with other substances.\n\nThus, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis\n* Ecstasy or MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)\n* Other unspecified drugs consumed by polydrug users"},
