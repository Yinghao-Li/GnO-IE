It is often used in the context of malignant neoplasms or tumors.\n* malignant glioma: This is a specific type of cancer that originates in the glial cells of the brain or spine. Gliomas are often aggressive and difficult to treat, making them a significant health concern.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. cancers\n2. malignant glioma"},
