Re is a symbol for the chemical element Rhenium. However, without further context, it is unclear if \"Re\" is being used as a shorthand for a specific rhenium compound or if it is being used to refer to the element itself.\n2. (300 mg / kg): This is a dosage amount and is not a chemical entity.\n3. OIH: This is likely a chemical entity, as it is being affected by the chemical \"Re.\" OIH is an abbreviation for \"opioid-induced hyperalgesia,\" which is a condition characterized by increased pain sensitivity due to the use of opioid medications. However, OIH is not a chemical itself, but rather a condition caused by the interaction of chemicals.\n4. Thermal sensitivity test: This is a procedure or method used to measure the sensitivity of an organism to heat. It is not a chemical entity.\n5. The acetic acid - induced writhing test: This is a procedure or method used to measure the pain response of an organism to acetic acid. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"Re,\" which may refer to a specific rhenium compound or the element itself, and OIH, which is a condition caused by the interaction of chemicals."},
