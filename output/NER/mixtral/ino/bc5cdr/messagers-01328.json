Hydroxychloroquine sulfate - This is a medication used to treat certain medical conditions, but it can also cause adverse effects, making it relevant in the context of a \"disease.\"\n2. Ocular and systemic adverse effects - These are negative consequences on the eye and overall body that can occur as a result of taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate.\n\nThere are no other disease entities explicitly mentioned in the paragraph."},
