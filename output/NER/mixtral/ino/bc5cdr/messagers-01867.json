Hepatic tissue: This refers to tissue found in the liver, which is composed of various types of cells including hepatocytes.\n3. Intestinal reperfusion: This is a medical procedure that involves restoring blood flow to the intestines after a period of ischemia or restricted blood flow.\n4. Oxidant stress: This refers to a state of increased oxidative stress, which can be caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify or repair the resulting damage.\n5. Hepatocytes: These are the main cell type found in liver tissue and are responsible for many of the liver's metabolic functions.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are GSSG and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are both involved in oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses."},

Reactive oxygen species (ROS): These are chemicals that are produced as byproducts of normal cellular metabolism and can cause oxidative stress when present in excess.\n\nTherefore, the relevant chemical entities in the paragraph are GSSG and reactive oxygen species (ROS)."},
