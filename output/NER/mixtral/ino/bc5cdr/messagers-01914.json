    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Cox regression analysis: This is a statistical method and not a chemical entity.\n2. IHC scores: IHC stands for Immunohistochemistry, which is a technique used to detect the presence and location of proteins in cells or tissues. It is not a chemical entity.\n3. Phospho AKT (pAKT): AKT is a protein that plays a key role in several cellular processes such as cell survival, growth, and proliferation. Phospho-AKT (pAKT) is the activated form of AKT, which occurs when AKT is phosphorylated (i.e., a phosphate group is added to it). Therefore, Phospho AKT (pAKT) is a chemical entity.\n4. PFS: PFS stands for Progression-Free Survival, which is a measure of the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Phospho AKT (pAKT)."},
