However, in the context of this paragraph, it is mentioned in the context of a study or research, so it can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n2. Glomerular sclerosis: This is a condition where there is scarring or hardening of the glomeruli, which are the filtering units of the kidney. Therefore, it can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n3. Aminonucleoside nephrosis: This is a kidney disease that is characterized by the accumulation of protein in the urine, as well as swelling in the legs and abdomen. It is caused by the administration of a compound called aminonucleoside. Therefore, it can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nIn summary, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Mesangial function, Glomerular sclerosis, and Aminonucleoside nephrosis."},
