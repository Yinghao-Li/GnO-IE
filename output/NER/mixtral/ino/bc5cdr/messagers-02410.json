Although it is a plant, it is often considered a chemical entity in a biological or pharmacological context.\n2. 5 weeks: While not a chemical, it is important to include this as a contextual entity for the dosage information.\n3. 250 mg / kg: This is a dosage amount, with \"mg\" representing milligrams and \"kg\" representing kilograms. It is a chemical dosage applied to the experimental subjects.\n4. isoproterenol: This is a chemical compound, specifically a synthetic catecholamine used as a medication and a research tool. It is often used to induce cardiac stress in animal models.\n5. injection: Although not a chemical, it is an important contextual entity, as it describes the method of administering the isoproterenol.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* S. virgaurea (or Solidago virgaurea)\n* 250 mg / kg (dosage amount)\n* isoproterenol (chemical compound)"},
