Recently, he was diagnosed with high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. He later recovered normal visual acuity.\n\nEntities:\n\n* Diabetes\n* Heart attack\n* High blood pressure\n* High cholesterol levels\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the revised paragraph, I have added several disease entities that are clearly mentioned. These include diabetes, heart attack, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels. These entities are relevant to the topic of diseases. The phrase \"recovered normal visual acuity\" is not a disease entity, but rather a positive outcome for a potential eye-related condition. Since no specific eye condition is mentioned, I have not included it as a disease entity."},
