    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation: This refers to the breaking of DNA into smaller fragments, which is a characteristic of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Here, DNA is the chemical entity.\n2. Gel electrophoresis: This is a laboratory technique used to separate DNA, RNA, or protein molecules based on their size and electrical charge. Although it is not a chemical itself, it is used to analyze chemical entities such as DNA.\n3. HL60 cell samples: HL60 is a type of human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Cells are not considered chemical entities, but they contain DNA, which is a chemical.\n4. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay: This is a laboratory technique used to detect DNA strand breaks, such as those caused by apoptosis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase is an enzyme that adds nucleotides to the 3'-hydroxyl ends of DNA strands. Therefore, the chemical entities here are DNA and the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.\n5. HBMP cells: HBMP cells are a type of cell, and they contain DNA, which is a chemical.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities in the paragraph are DNA and the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase."},
