Urodynamic parameters: This is a general term that refers to various measurements taken during a urodynamic study, which is a test used to evaluate the bladder's function and ability to store and release urine. It does not refer to a specific chemical entity.\n2. Bladder pressure - volume curve: This is also a general term that refers to a graphical representation of the relationship between bladder pressure and bladder volume during a urodynamic study. It does not refer to a specific chemical entity.\n3. Maximum voiding pressure (MVP): This is a specific measurement taken during a urodynamic study that refers to the maximum pressure generated by the bladder during urination. It does not refer to a specific chemical entity.\n4. Maximum cystometric capacity (MCC): This is another specific measurement taken during a urodynamic study that refers to the maximum volume that the bladder can hold before the individual feels the urge to urinate. It does not refer to a specific chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, there are no chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph. The terms used refer to measurements and parameters used in urodynamic studies."},
