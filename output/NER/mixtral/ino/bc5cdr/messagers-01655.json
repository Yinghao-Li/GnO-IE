Paranoia is a psychological condition, and while serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a type of chemical), it is not the focus of the paragraph. The paragraph is about serotonin reuptake blockers and their potential role in exacerbating paranoia in certain patients, making this the only relevant chemical entity."},
