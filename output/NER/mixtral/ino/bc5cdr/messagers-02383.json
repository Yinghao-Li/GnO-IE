It is the second most common type of blood cancer, and it is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of plasma cells, which can lead to the production of abnormal amounts of antibodies, bone destruction, and impaired immune function. In the given paragraph, multiple myeloma is the disease of interest, as the study analyzes the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who received bortezomib and dexamethasone as salvage therapy."},
