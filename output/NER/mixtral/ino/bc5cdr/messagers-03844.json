It is a pathological condition, and thus, it can be considered a disease entity.\n* PAN rats: PAN stands for Periarteritis Nodosa, which is a rare type of vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels). It is a disease entity.\n* controls were normal: In this context, \"normal\" implies the absence of any disease or abnormalities. Therefore, it does not refer to a disease entity.\n\nDisease entities in the paragraph:\n\n* Glomerular sclerosis\n* Periarteritis Nodosa (PAN)"},
