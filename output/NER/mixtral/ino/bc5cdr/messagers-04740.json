Obstruction: This is not a specific disease, but it can be a complication of various medical conditions, including ureteric stones. In this context, obstruction likely refers to a blockage in the urinary tract that can prevent the normal flow of urine.\n3. HIV infection: HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a viral infection that attacks the immune system and can lead to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) if left untreated.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Ureteric stones\n* HIV infection"},
