Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is a genetic disorder characterized by the inability to regulate body water levels, resulting in excessive thirst and urination. It is caused by a mutation in the AVP gene, which encodes for the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and its carrier protein, neurophysin II. In this case, the specific mutation is a missense mutation encoding Gly23 -> Val in neurophysin II."},
