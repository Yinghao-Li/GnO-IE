The term \"mutations\" is the only entity in the paragraph that is directly related to a disease or condition.\n2. Specifically, \"ATM mutations\" are mentioned, which implies a genetic mutation in the ATM gene. This gene is associated with several diseases, such as Ataxia-telangiectasia, a rare inherited disorder that affects the brain and other body systems.\n3. Although the paragraph does not explicitly name the disease, it is still related to a disease context due to the mention of mutations in the ATM gene.\n\nHence, the relevant \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. ATM mutations"},
