In this paragraph, the following diseases are mentioned:\n * PAX6 mutation\n * aniridia\n3. However, it is important to note that \"PAX6 mutation\" is not a disease itself, but rather a genetic mutation that can lead to various diseases, including aniridia.\n4. Therefore, the only disease entity in this paragraph is \"aniridia\".\n\nAnswer: The disease entity in the paragraph is aniridia."},

Therefore, it is not relevant to the task of identifying disease entities.\n* Missing PAX6 missense mutations are not diseases, but rather genetic mutations. Therefore, they are not relevant to the task of identifying disease entities.\n* Aniridia is a medical condition, and therefore it is a relevant disease entity.\n\nAnswer: The relevant disease entity in the paragraph is aniridia."},
