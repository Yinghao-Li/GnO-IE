The text mentions two protein names, \"BARD1\" and \"BRCA1.\"\n3. While proteins are not considered \"diseases\" per se, mutations in genes that encode for these proteins can lead to diseases.\n4. Specifically, mutations in the BRCA1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer.\n5. Therefore, although the text does not explicitly mention the term \"disease,\" it discusses the proteins BARD1 and BRCA1 in the context of tumor suppression, which is a disease-related concept.\n\nTo summarize, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and the general concept of tumor suppression."},
