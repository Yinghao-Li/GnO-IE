However, there are several indications of a potential issue with a protein or its processing, which could be related to a genetic or inherited disease.\n\nThe entities that could be related to a \"Disease\" are:\n\n1. W474C - containing alpha - subunit precursor\n2. Phosphorylation or secretion issues\n3. Absence of mature lysosomal alpha - subunit\n\nThese entities may be indicative of a disease or genetic disorder, but they are not specific diseases themselves.
