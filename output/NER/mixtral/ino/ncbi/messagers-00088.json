This term implies that they all have a medical condition or disease.\n4. However, the specific disease or medical condition is not explicitly named in the paragraph.\n5. Instead, the paragraph focuses on the genetic mutation (G1758 --> T) that is associated with the disease.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot identify specific \"Disease\" entities.
