However, in this paragraph, it is mentioned in the context of a tumor suppressor gene, PTEN / MMAC1, which suggests that the tumor refers to cancerous growth.\n* 'prostate cancer' is a specific disease, a type of cancer that occurs in a man's prostate, a small walnut-shaped gland that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. tumor (cancerous growth)\n2. prostate cancer"},
