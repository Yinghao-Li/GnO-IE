Research each word or phrase to determine if it is a disease.\n\nApplying this process to the paragraph:\n\n1. The potential disease-related words or phrases in the paragraph are \"Large-scale RNA differential display technology\" and \"differentially expressed genes.\" However, these terms refer to techniques used in genetic research and are not diseases themselves.\n2. The specific gene mentioned, \"an alpha carbonic anhydrase gene, termed CA12,\" is not a disease. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that plays a role in maintaining acid-base balance in the body.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},
