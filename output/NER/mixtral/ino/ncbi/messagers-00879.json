In recent years, the world has faced several health challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the resurgence of diseases like tuberculosis and malaria, and the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in millions of deaths and has had a profound impact on the global economy. Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs, is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, ranking above HIV/AIDS. Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, is another major global health challenge, with an estimated 229 million cases and 409,000 deaths in 2019. Antimicrobial resistance, the ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of medications and disinfectants, is a growing threat to global health and food security, as it can make common infections harder to treat and increase the risk of severe illness and death.\n\nDiseases:\n\n* COVID-19\n* tuberculosis\n* malaria\n* antimicrobial resistance (Note: Antimicrobial resistance is a phenomenon, but it is directly related to the diseases caused by microorganisms that have become resistant to medications and disinfectants.)"},
