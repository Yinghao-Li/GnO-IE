It is a gene associated with certain genetic disorders, such as Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1). Hypermethylation of the DMPK gene has been linked to this disorder.\n\nBased on the research, the disease entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* Hypermethylated DMPK gene, which is associated with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1)."},
