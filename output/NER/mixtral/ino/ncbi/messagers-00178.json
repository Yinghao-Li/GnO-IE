Aspartylglucosaminuria\n\nIn the given paragraph, the only disease entity mentioned is \"Aspartylglucosaminuria.\" It is a rare inherited disorder of metabolism in which the body is missing an enzyme needed to break down a complex sugar called aspartylglucosamine. This condition is also known as \"Aspartylglucosaminidase deficiency.\" It can lead to the accumulation of this complex sugar in various tissues and organs, causing progressive damage and resulting in a range of symptoms. The mention of \"Palestinian Arabs\" in the title refers to the population affected by this disease, not a disease itself."},
