Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it is being used to describe a disease or medical condition.\n\nIn this paragraph, there are no direct mentions of any diseases. However, the mention of genetic analysis and chromosomal patterns might suggest an underlying genetic condition.\n\nThe SNRPN gene is associated with Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome, both of which are genetic disorders. Methylation analysis at exon alpha of the SNRPN gene is a diagnostic test often used to identify these conditions.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Prader-Willi syndrome\n* Angelman syndrome\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the paragraph does not explicitly mention either of these diseases.
