Myotonic dystrophy is a well-known genetic disorder.\n2. It is a type of muscular dystrophy, characterized by muscle weakness and myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction).\n3. Myotonic dystrophy has two major types: DM1 (Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 or Steinert's Disease) and DM2 (Myotonic Dystrophy Type 2 or Proximal Myotonic Myopathy).\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* myotonic dystrophy"},
