Therefore, \"isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis\" is the disease entity in this paragraph.\n\n2. Constitutional WT1 mutations\n\nWT1 is a gene that encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in kidney development. Mutations in the WT1 gene can lead to various kidney diseases, including Denys-Drash syndrome and Wilms' tumor. In this paragraph, the term \"constitutional WT1 mutations\" refers to genetic alterations in the WT1 gene that are present from birth and can cause kidney disease. Therefore, \"constitutional WT1 mutations\" is also a disease entity in this paragraph."},
