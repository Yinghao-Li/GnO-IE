BRCA2 is a gene that is associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.\n3. The phrase \"BRCA2 - mutation families\" also indicates that this is a group of families with a mutation in the BRCA2 gene.\n4. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"BRCA2\" and \"BRCA2 - mutation families\".\n\nIt's important to note that the word \"penetrance\" is a term used in genetics to describe the proportion of individuals with a particular genetic variant who exhibit a given phenotype. It does not refer to a disease itself."},
