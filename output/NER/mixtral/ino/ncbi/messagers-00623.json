This can make it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively, which can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue.\n\n2. Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD): This is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down certain fats for energy. When the body is unable to metabolize these fats properly, it can lead to a buildup of toxic substances in the body, which can cause a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, developmental delays, and liver problems.\n\nBoth of these conditions are mentioned in the paragraph and can be considered \"Disease\" entities."},
