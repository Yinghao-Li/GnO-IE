Analyze each entity to determine if it is a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two potential disease-related entities:\n\n1. C2 deficiency\n2. HLA - B\n\nNow, let's analyze each entity:\n\n1. C2 deficiency: This is a condition where the C2 protein, a component of the complement system, is either partially or completely missing. This deficiency can make a person more susceptible to certain infections and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, C2 deficiency is a disease.\n2. HLA - B: HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) is a group of proteins present on the surface of white blood cells. They play an essential role in the body's immune system by helping it distinguish between its own cells and foreign substances. HLA - B is one of the HLA genes that provide instructions for creating these proteins. While HLA - B itself is not a disease, variations or mutations in this gene can contribute to certain diseases, such as autoimmune disorders and susceptibility to specific infections. However, in this context, HLA - B is not directly referred to as a disease.\n\nIn summary, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n1. C2 deficiency"},
