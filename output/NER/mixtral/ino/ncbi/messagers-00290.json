However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the \"Disease\" entities are likely to be related to genetic disorders or conditions that can be caused by PTEN mutations.\n2. PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog) is a tumor suppressor gene that can negatively regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival.\n3. Mutations in the PTEN gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancer and inherited genetic disorders such as Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and Proteus syndrome.\n4. However, without further context or information, it is not possible to determine the specific diseases associated with the PTEN mutations mentioned in the paragraph."},
