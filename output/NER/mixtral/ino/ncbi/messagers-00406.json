The term \"DM\" is often used to refer to a group of genetic disorders known as muscular dystrophies.\n3. The paragraph mentions that splicing of cTNT (cardiac troponin T) was disrupted in DM striated muscle.\n4. Disruption of cTNT splicing can lead to various heart conditions, including cardiomyopathy.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Danon Disease (DM)\n* Muscular dystrophies (related to DM)\n* Cardiomyopathy (potential consequence of cTNT splicing disruption)"},
