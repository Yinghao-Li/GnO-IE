It is caused by the influenza virus, which spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. You can also get it by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your own mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\nCommon symptoms of the flu include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, and fatigue. Most people who get the flu will recover in a few days to less than two weeks, but some people may develop complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections. The flu can also worsen existing medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease.\n\nInfluenza can be prevented by getting vaccinated every year. The flu vaccine causes your body to develop antibodies that protect you against the virus. It is recommended that everyone 6 months of age and older get vaccinated against the flu every year.\n\nIdentified Disease Entities:\n\n1. Influenza\n2. Viral infection\n3. Flu\n4. Pneumonia\n5.
