The childhood form of ALD, often referred to as \"childhood ALD,\" is a severe and rapidly progressing form of the disease that typically appears between the ages of 4 and 10. The disease is characterized by the breakdown of myelin, the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers in the brain, leading to a range of neurological symptoms. In the paragraph you provided, the patients were found to have \"massive demyelination of the cerebral white matter with sparing of the U-fibers,\" which is consistent with the findings typically seen in childhood ALD."},
