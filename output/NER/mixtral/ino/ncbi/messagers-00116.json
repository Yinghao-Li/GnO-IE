Research or analyze the context of these words or phrases to determine if they refer to a disease.\n\nIn this paragraph, there are no clear disease names mentioned directly. However, the context suggests that the \"G301C\" mutation is being discussed in relation to a genetic disorder.\n\n\"G301C\" is a genetic mutation in the GALNS gene, which is associated with a disease called Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI), also known as Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. Therefore, even though the disease is not explicitly named in the paragraph, the context implies that the \"disease\" in question is Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI.\n\nIt's important to note that the paragraph discusses the origin of the G301C mutation in a specific population (Colombian patients), but the focus of the paragraph is still on a genetic disorder, making \"Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI\" the implied disease entity."},
