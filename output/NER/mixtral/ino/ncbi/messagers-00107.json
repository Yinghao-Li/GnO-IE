Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA\n\nTo confirm, I searched for the term \"Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA\" and found that it is a recognized medical condition. Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA, also known as Morquio A syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of certain complex sugars in various tissues of the body, causing a range of symptoms including skeletal abnormalities, heart problems, and short stature."},
