Genetic heterogeneity - Although not a disease itself, genetic heterogeneity refers to the presence of different genetic variations or mutations that can lead to the same disease. In this context, genetic heterogeneity refers to the different genetic mutations that can occur in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, contributing to breast cancer susceptibility.\n\n2. Breast cancer - This is the primary disease of interest in the paragraph. Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that starts in the cells of the breast. In this context, breast cancer is discussed in relation to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are known to increase the risk of developing breast cancer when mutated."},
