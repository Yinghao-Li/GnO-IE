However, \"AAPC\" seems to be a specific term used in this context and may not be a widely recognized term for a disease.\n2. The paragraph mentions \"affected individuals\" and \"their phenotypic differences,\" which suggests that these individuals have some kind of genetic disorder.\n3. The gene being screened in these affected individuals is the \"APC gene.\" APC stands for \"Adenomatous Polyposis Coli,\" which is a gene associated with a hereditary colon cancer syndrome known as Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP).\n\nBased on the information provided, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)\n* Colon cancer (implied)\n\nThese diseases are associated with the APC gene and are the focus of the protein-truncation test (PTT) assay mentioned in the paragraph."},
