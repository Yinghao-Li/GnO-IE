However, based on the context provided, it seems that decreased fertility is being mentioned as a characteristic of males with adult onset DM (Diabetes Mellitus).\n2. Adult onset DM: This refers to Diabetes Mellitus, specifically the type that develops in adulthood. DM is a disease that affects the body's ability to produce or use insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels.\n3. Congenital DM: This refers to a rare form of Diabetes Mellitus that is present at birth or develops shortly after birth due to genetic defects.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Diabetes Mellitus (DM)\n* Congenital Diabetes Mellitus (Congenital DM)"},
