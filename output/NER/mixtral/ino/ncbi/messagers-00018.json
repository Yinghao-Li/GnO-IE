They are ion pumps that play a crucial role in maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane.\n* DMPK is a gene that, when mutated, can cause myotonic dystrophy type 1, a genetic disorder that affects muscle function. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, after removing irrelevant entities, the remaining entity is:\n\n* DMPK (myotonic dystrophy type 1)"},
