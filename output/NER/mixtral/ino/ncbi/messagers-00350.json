It describes the identification of three different types of mutations (a missense mutation, a splice-donor mutation, and a frameshift mutation) in the coding region of the SCN5A gene in three families undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, mutations in the SCN5A gene have been associated with various diseases, such as certain types of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death."},
