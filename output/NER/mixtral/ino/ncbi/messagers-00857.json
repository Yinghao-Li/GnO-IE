Two conditions are mentioned: \"pathological ARSA\" and \"GS.\"\n3. \"ARSA\" stands for \"arylsulfatase A,\" which is an enzyme associated with a disease called Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD).\n4. \"GS\" likely refers to \"ganglioside GM2,\" which is associated with another disease called Tay-Sachs disease.\n5. Both MLD and Tay-Sachs disease are lysosomal storage disorders, which are genetic diseases caused by enzyme deficiencies.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD), associated with ARSA\n* Tay-Sachs disease, associated with GM2 ganglioside."},
