The paragraph mentions a \"missense mutation\" and \"FNDI patients,\" but it does not explicitly name a specific disease. A \"missense mutation\" is a type of mutation in DNA where a single nucleotide is changed, leading to a different amino acid in the resulting protein. \"FNDI\" likely stands for \"Familial Neuropathy, Sensorimotor, Dominant Inheritance,\" which is a type of hereditary neuropathy affecting the peripheral nerves. However, neither of these terms refers to a disease itself."},
