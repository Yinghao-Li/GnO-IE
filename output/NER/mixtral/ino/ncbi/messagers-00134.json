To confirm, let's look up \"DM\" in the medical context. DM stands for Diabetes Mellitus. However, \"congenital DM\" is not a standard medical term.\n5. Since the context is about transmission, \"DM\" here most likely refers to a genetic disorder, which is Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (also known as Steinert's disease).\n6. \"Congenital\" indicates that the disease is present at birth.\n\nAnswer: The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"congenital DM\" or, more specifically, \"Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.\""},
