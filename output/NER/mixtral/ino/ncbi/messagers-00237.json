Anhaptoglobinemia: This term refers to the absence or extremely low levels of haptoglobin in the blood. Haptoglobin is a protein that binds to free hemoglobin in the bloodstream, preventing kidney damage. Anhaptoglobinemia can be a symptom or a result of various medical conditions, such as hemolytic anemia, liver disease, or malnutrition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n1.
