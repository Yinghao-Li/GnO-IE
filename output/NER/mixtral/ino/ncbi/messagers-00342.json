SCA3: This is an abbreviation for Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, which is a genetic disorder that affects the cerebellum and causes problems with coordination and movement.\n\nGiven that the context of the paragraph is about a specific medical condition, it is likely that \"gaze-evoked nystagmus,\" \"saccade hypometria\" are also medical terms referring to specific symptoms or aspects of the disease.\n\n2. Gaze-evoked nystagmus: This is a type of nystagmus, which is an involuntary movement of the eyes. Gaze-evoked nystagmus occurs when the eyes move to the side and is often associated with conditions affecting the cerebellum or brainstem.\n\n3. Saccade hypometria: This is a medical term used to describe a condition in which the eyes do not move far enough during a rapid eye movement, known as a saccade. This can result in difficulty tracking moving objects and is often associated with conditions affecting the cerebellum or brainstem.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* SCA3\n* Gaze-evoked nystagmus\n* Saccade hypometria"},
