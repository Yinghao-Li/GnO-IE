Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it is referring to a disease.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there is only one potential disease-related phrase:\n\n* copper toxicosis\n\nNow, let's analyze the context:\n\n* The paragraph is discussing genetic mapping of a specific locus in Bedlington terriers to a region on dog chromosome 10, which is syntenic (has a similar gene order) to a region on human chromosome 2p13 - p16.\n* The phrase \"copper toxicosis\" refers to a condition in which an organism has a buildup of copper in its body, leading to poisoning. This condition is known to occur in Bedlington terriers, and the paragraph is discussing the genetic mapping of this condition in that breed.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* copper toxicosis"},
