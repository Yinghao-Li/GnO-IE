Research or analyze the terms to confirm if they are actual diseases.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there are two terms that could be potential disease-related entities:\n\n1. A - T\n2. radioresistant DNA synthesis\n\nLet's analyze these terms:\n\n1. A - T: This term is most likely referring to Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), which is a genetic disorder that affects the brain and other body systems. It is characterized by progressive neurologic degeneration, immune system problems, and an increased risk of cancer.\n2. radioresistant DNA synthesis: This term is not a disease itself but a biological process. It refers to the ability of certain cells to continue synthesizing DNA even when exposed to ionizing radiation. However, increased cellular radioresistant DNA synthesis could be a symptom or characteristic of a disease, especially in the context of cancer and radiation therapy.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T)."},
