Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nStep 1:\n\n* alpha - MSH\n* regulation of food intake\n* human obesity\n* chromosome 2\n* POMC locus\n\nStep 2:\n\n* alpha - MSH: Not a disease. It is a neuropeptide involved in the regulation of food intake.\n* regulation of food intake: Not a disease. It is a physiological process.\n* human obesity: This is a disease. It is a condition characterized by excessive body fat accumulation to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health.\n* chromosome 2: Not a disease. It is a chromosome in humans that contains genetic material.\n* POMC locus: Not a disease. It is a location on chromosome 2 where the POMC gene is found.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is \"human obesity\"."},
