A \"founder mutation\" refers to a genetic mutation that is present in a population due to the descendants of a single ancestor who carried the mutation. This concept is often discussed in the context of genetic diseases, as these mutations can lead to increased prevalence of certain genetic disorders within specific populations.\n\nTherefore, while no specific disease is mentioned in the paragraph, the \"Disease\" entities being referred to are genetic diseases that could be associated with the founder mutation in the discussed population groups."},
