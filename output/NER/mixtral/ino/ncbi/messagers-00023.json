Analyze each term to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related terms in the paragraph:\n\n* constitutional RB1 - gene mutations\n* isolated unilateral retinoblastoma\n\nStep 2: Analyzing each term:\n\n* constitutional RB1 - gene mutations: This term refers to genetic mutations in the RB1 gene, which can lead to retinoblastoma. Since it refers to a genetic abnormality, it can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n* isolated unilateral retinoblastoma: This term refers to a specific type of retinoblastoma, which is a rare eye cancer that primarily affects young children. Since it is a medical condition, it can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. constitutional RB1 - gene mutations\n2. isolated unilateral retinoblastoma"},
