To confirm, we need to understand that BRCA1 is a gene associated with breast and ovarian cancer. Mutations in the BRCA1 gene increase the risk of developing these cancers.\n5. Therefore, \"the four BRCA1 mutations\" can be identified as the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph. However, it's important to note that the mutations themselves are not diseases but rather increase the risk of developing diseases."},
