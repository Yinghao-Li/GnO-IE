Analyze the context of each term to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph, the potential disease-related terms are:\n\n* Hp2 / Hpdel\n* healthy volunteers\n* Hp1 / Hpdel\n\nLet's analyze the context of each term:\n\n1. Hp2 / Hpdel: This term refers to a genotype or genetic variant. It does not directly refer to a disease.\n2. Healthy volunteers: This term implies that these individuals do not have any known diseases or health issues, as they are being compared to individuals with potential health problems.\n3. Hp1 / Hpdel: This term also refers to a genotype or genetic variant and does not directly refer to a disease.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only term that might be related to a disease is \"healthy volunteers,\" as it implies a comparison to individuals who may have health issues. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific diseases. Therefore, there are no clear \"Disease\" entities in the provided paragraph."},
