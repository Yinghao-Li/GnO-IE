Research or use prior knowledge to determine if they are actual diseases.\n\nIn the paragraph, the potential disease-related words/phrases are:\n\n* loss - of - function mutations\n* a complete absence of the normal copy of ATM\n* sporadic T - PLL\n* pathogenesis\n\nNow, let's determine if they are actual diseases:\n\n1. Loss-of-function mutations - These are not diseases themselves but rather a type of genetic mutation that can lead to diseases.\n2. A complete absence of the normal copy of ATM - This is also not a disease but a genetic condition that can contribute to diseases.\n3. Sporadic T-PLL - This is likely the disease referred to in the paragraph. T-PLL stands for T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, a rare and aggressive type of leukemia. The term \"sporadic\" is used to describe cases that are not inherited but occur randomly.\n4. Pathogenesis - This term refers to the mechanism by which a disease develops and progresses. It is not a disease itself.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL)"},
