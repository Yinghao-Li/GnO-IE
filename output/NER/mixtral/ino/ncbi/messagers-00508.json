Research or examine the context of each phrase to determine if it is a disease entity.\n\nIn this paragraph, there are two disease-related phrases:\n\n1. X-linked Dystrophinopathy (XLDCM)\n2. DMD (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy)\n\nNow, let's examine the context and confirm if they are actual disease entities:\n\n1. X-linked Dystrophinopathy (XLDCM) - This term refers to a group of muscle disorders caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which is located on the X chromosome. XLDCM includes Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD).\n2. DMD (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) - This is a specific type of X-linked dystrophinopathy characterized by progressive muscle weakness, which typically begins in early childhood. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which codes for the protein dystrophin.\n\nTherefore, both X-linked Dystrophinopathy (XLDCM) and DMD are disease entities."},
