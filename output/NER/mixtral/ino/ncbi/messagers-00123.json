It is a characteristic of a disease, not a disease itself.\n * Those families: This refers to a group of people affected by a disease, but it is not a disease itself.\n * Causative mutations: These are genetic changes that can lead to a disease, but they are not a disease itself.\n\nTherefore, none of the entities in the paragraph clearly refer to a disease.
