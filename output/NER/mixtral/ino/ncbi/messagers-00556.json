Research and verify if the terms are indeed diseases.\n\nThe potential disease-related terms in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Uniparental disomy\n2. Unbalanced segregation\n3. Non-Robertsonian translocations\n4. PWS\n\nNow, let's research and verify if these terms are diseases:\n\n1. Uniparental disomy: It is a genetic condition where an individual receives two copies of a chromosome, or a part of a chromosome, from one parent and no copies from the other parent. It is not a disease itself but a genetic phenomenon that can lead to various genetic disorders.\n2. Unbalanced segregation: It is a term used in genetics to describe an error in chromosome separation during cell division, leading to an abnormal number of chromosomes in the offspring. It is not a disease but a cause of genetic disorders.\n3. Non-Robertsonian translocations: It is a type of chromosomal abnormality where a chromosome breaks and reattaches to another chromosome at a non-centromeric region. It is not a disease but a genetic alteration that can lead to genetic disorders.\n4. PWS: Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder that affects growth, behavior, and cognitive development. It is caused by the absence of certain genetic material on chromosome 15.\n\nBased on the research, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. PWS (Prader-Willi Syndrome)\n\nThe other terms (Uniparental disomy, Unbalanced segregation, Non-Robertsonian translocations) are genetic phenomena or chromosomal abnormalities that can lead to genetic disorders but are not diseases themselves."},
