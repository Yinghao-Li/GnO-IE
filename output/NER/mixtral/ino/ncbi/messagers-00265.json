The text discusses a mutation in the HFE gene that affects its ability to associate with beta2-microglobulin (beta2m), which in turn prevents cell-surface expression. However, it does not explicitly mention any disease associated with this mutation.\n\nThe HFE gene is known to be associated with hereditary hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from food. Mutations in the HFE gene can lead to an accumulation of iron in various organs, potentially causing damage and disease.
