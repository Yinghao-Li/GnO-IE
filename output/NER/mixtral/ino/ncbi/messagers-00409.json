FNDI is referred to as a \"disease\" in the text.\n3. The text also mentions that FNDI is caused by a deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP is not a disease but a hormone.\n4. The deficiency in AVP is due to mutations in the AVP-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene. Again, genes are not diseases, but mutations in genes can lead to diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI)"},
