Although mosaicism is not a disease itself, it can be a condition that leads to various diseases due to the presence of two or more genetically different cell populations in an individual.\n2. The second disease entity is \"tumors\" in the phrase \"1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors.\" Tumors refer to an abnormal growth of cells that can form a mass of tissue.\n3. The third disease entity is \"retinoblastoma\" in the phrase \"the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma.\" Retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that usually develops in children under the age of 5.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities in the paragraph are mosaicism, tumors, and retinoblastoma."},
