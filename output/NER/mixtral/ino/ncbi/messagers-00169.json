It is a disease.\n * CDK4 gene: This gene is a cell cycle control gene, but it is not a disease.\n * melanoma: This is a type of cancer that develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin, the pigment that gives your skin its color. It is a disease.\n\nTherefore, the entities that clearly refer to Disease are \"familial melanoma\" and \"melanoma\"."},
