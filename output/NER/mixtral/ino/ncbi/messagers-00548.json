Research each term to determine if it is a disease.\n\nStep 1: Potential disease-related terms in the paragraph are \"PWS\" and \"47 chromosomes.\"\n\nStep 2: Research each term:\n\n* PWS: Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder that affects both males and females. It is characterized by weak muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding difficulties, poor growth, and delayed development in childhood. Individuals with PWS have distinctive facial features, short stature, and often intellectual disabilities.\n\nThe term \"47 chromosomes\" suggests a chromosomal abnormality. In this case, the individual has an extra chromosome, which is a condition known as trisomy. The most common form of trisomy is Down syndrome (trisomy 21), but there are other forms, such as trisomy 13 and trisomy 18. In this case, the person has a trisomy of chromosome 15, which is not a common trisomy.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS)\n* Trisomy of chromosome 15 (supernumerary paternal der(15))"},
