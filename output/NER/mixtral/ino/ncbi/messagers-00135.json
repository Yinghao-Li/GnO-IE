Determine if \"congenital\" is being used as an adjective to describe a disease. Congenital itself is not a disease, but rather a descriptor for a condition that is present at birth.\n4. DM is an abbreviation, so we need to determine what it stands for. In the context of diseases, DM often stands for Diabetes Mellitus.\n5. However, the full name of the disease is not mentioned in the text, so we cannot confirm that DM stands for Diabetes Mellitus.\n6. Furthermore, the term \"congenital DM\" may refer to a specific form of diabetes mellitus that is present at birth, but without additional context, we cannot confirm this.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can only tentatively identify \"DM\" as a potential disease entity, but we cannot definitively confirm what \"DM\" stands for or whether it refers to a specific disease."},
