However, the text discusses a \"mutation\" in exon 4, which could imply the presence of a genetic disorder or disease. Exon 4 is a part of a gene, and mutations in genes can lead to various diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are implied by the mention of the \"mutation\" in exon 4.
