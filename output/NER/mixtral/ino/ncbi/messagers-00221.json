However, the text describes the identification of an \"abnormally spliced transcript\" which could potentially be associated with a genetic disorder or disease.\n\nThe term \"premature termination codon\" might also suggest a genetic disorder, as such mutations can lead to truncated or non-functional proteins, which can cause various diseases.
