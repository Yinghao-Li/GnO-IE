Patients: This term refers to individuals who have been diagnosed with a medical condition or disease.\n4. Isolated unilateral retinoblastoma: This is the primary disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. Retinoblastoma is a rare form of eye cancer that typically affects young children. \"Isolated\" indicates that the cancer is present in only one eye, while \"unilateral\" refers to the fact that it is affecting only one side of the body.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"retinoblastoma\" and \"RB1 gene mutations.\""},
