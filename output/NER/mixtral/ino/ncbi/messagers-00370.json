However, in this context, WT1 heterozygous mutations are not considered a disease themselves but a genetic alteration that can contribute to certain diseases.\n * IDMS: After researching, IDMS stands for IgM deficiency with or without associated myelodysplasia syndrome. It is a medical condition where the patient has a deficiency in IgM immunoglobulins and may or may not have myelodysplasia syndrome, which affects the bone marrow's ability to produce healthy blood cells.\n3.
