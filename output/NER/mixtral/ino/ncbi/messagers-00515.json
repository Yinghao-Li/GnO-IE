Analyze the context of each term to determine if it is being used to describe a disease or condition.\n\nApplying this process to the paragraph:\n\n1. Potential disease-related terms: \"mutations\", \"interfere with appropriate synthesis of ACTH and alpha - MSH\"\n2. Analyzing the context:\n * The term \"mutations\" is used to describe changes in the genetic code, not a disease itself.\n * \"Interfere with appropriate synthesis of ACTH and alpha - MSH\" refers to the consequences of the mutations, which can lead to specific diseases. ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone) and alpha-MSH (alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone) are hormones involved in various physiological processes. Defects in their synthesis can lead to conditions such as pituitary insufficiency, adrenal insufficiency, or skin pigmentation disorders.\n\nThere are no explicit \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph. However, the described mutations can lead to various diseases related to hormonal imbalances and pigmentation issues."},
