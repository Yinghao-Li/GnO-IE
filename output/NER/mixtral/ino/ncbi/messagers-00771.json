Potential disease-related words or phrases: homozygous deficiency, large deletion of the FH gene, the deficiency.\n2. Research or analyze the context:\n* Homozygous deficiency: This term typically refers to a recessive genetic disorder where an individual inherits two copies of a defective gene, one from each parent. It is not a specific disease but a genetic condition that can lead to various diseases depending on the gene involved.\n* Large deletion of the FH gene: FH stands for Fumarate Hydratase, a gene associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). A large deletion of the FH gene can be a genetic defect causing HLRCC.\n* The deficiency: In this context, it most likely refers to the Fumarate Hydratase deficiency associated with HLRCC.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Homozygous deficiency (specifically, Fumarate Hydratase deficiency)\n* Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC)"},
