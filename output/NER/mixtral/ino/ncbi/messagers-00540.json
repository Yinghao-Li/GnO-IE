The second disease entity is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred from the context. The mention of \"unaffected mutation carriers\" suggests that there is a genetic mutation associated with the development of the tumors. Therefore, the implied disease entity is the genetic condition that predisposes individuals to develop unilateral tumors.\n\nSo, the two disease entities in the paragraph are \"unilateral tumors\" and the genetic condition associated with the tumors."},
