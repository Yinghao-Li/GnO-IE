If you could give me a paragraph that mentions specific diseases, I would be happy to help you identify those entities.\n\nIn general, some examples of disease entities that you might find in a text could include specific medical conditions such as \"cancer,\" \"Alzheimer's disease,\" \"diabetes,\" or \"influenza.\" These entities can be identified by their common names, as well as by their scientific or medical terminology. For example, \"malignant neoplasm\" and \"tumor\" are both terms that could refer to cancer. Similarly, \"dementia\" and \"Alzheimer's disease\" are related but distinct disease entities.\n\nIn order to accurately identify disease entities in a text, it is important to consider the context in which they are mentioned, as well as any relevant medical or scientific terminology."},
