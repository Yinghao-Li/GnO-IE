The paragraph mentions three medical conditions: benign breast, invasive lobular cancers, and low-grade ductal carcinomas.\n3. Benign breast refers to non-cancerous growths or abnormalities in the breast tissue.\n4. Invasive lobular cancers refer to a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands (lobules) of the breast and then spreads to the surrounding breast tissue.\n5. Low-grade ductal carcinomas refer to a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk ducts and grows slowly.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Benign breast\n* Invasive lobular cancers\n* Low-grade ductal carcinomas"},
