Cystinosis is a genetic disorder that causes an abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine within cells. Nephropathic cystinosis is the most common and severe form of the disorder, and it primarily affects the kidneys.\n\nThe first mutation, 1195delC, is said to be a novel mutation, but it does not explicitly mention the disease it is associated with. The second mutation, 1936delG, is described to cause C6D in an unrelated African-American individual. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entity in this context is C6D (Cystinosis, Nephropathic)."},
