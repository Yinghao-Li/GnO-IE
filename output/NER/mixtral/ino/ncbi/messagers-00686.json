However, its expression can be altered in certain conditions, such as hypoxia or cancer.\n* CA9 expression: Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) is an enzyme that is often associated with hypoxia and various types of cancer, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\n\nBased on the research, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL)\n2. Hypoxia\n3. Cancer (specifically mentioned in relation to CA9 expression)"},
