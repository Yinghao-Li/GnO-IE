Analyze the context of each word or phrase to determine if it refers to a disease.\n\nIn the paragraph you provided, the potential disease-related words or phrases are:\n\n* PTEN mutation\n* breast involvement (unaffected, benign, malignant)\n\nNow, let's analyze the context:\n\n* PTEN mutation: PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene. A mutation in this gene can lead to various diseases, including cancers. Therefore, \"PTEN mutation\" can be considered a disease entity.\n* Breast involvement (unaffected, benign, malignant): These terms describe the condition or state of the breast. \"Unaffected\" means the breast is normal or free from disease. \"Benign\" refers to non-cancerous breast conditions, while \"malignant\" indicates the presence of breast cancer. Therefore, \"benign\" and \"malignant\" can be considered disease entities.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. PTEN mutation\n2. Benign breast conditions\n3. Breast cancer (malignant)"},
