Therefore, the \"TSD gene\" is a gene associated with a specific disease.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the term \"mutant\" is used to describe the genes, but it does not necessarily imply that they are diseases themselves. Instead, mutations in these genes can lead to diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* TSD (Tay-Sachs Disease)\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the other gene mentioned in the paragraph is also likely to be associated with a disease, but it is not explicitly stated in the text."},
