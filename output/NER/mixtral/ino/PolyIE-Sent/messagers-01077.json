The second material name is \"PSCs,\" which stands for Perovskite Solar Cells. It's important to note that PSCs are not a single material but a type of solar cell that uses a perovskite-structured compound as the light-harvesting active layer. However, in this context, it is being treated as a material.\n3. The third material name is \"donor\" and \"acceptor.\" These are general terms used to describe the materials in a solar cell, where the donor is the material that provides electrons and the acceptor is the material that accepts these electrons. In this case, PBDT-TDPP-S is the donor material.\n4. The last material names are \"E HOMO\" and \"E LUMO.\" These are the energy levels of the materials: E HOMO stands for the Energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital, and E LUMO stands for the Energy of the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital. These energy levels are essential properties of materials used in solar cells.\n\nSo, the material names in the paragraph are:\n\n1. PBDT-TDPP-S\n2. PSCs (Perovskite Solar Cells)\n3. Donor\n4. Acceptor\n5. E HOMO (Energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital)\n6. E LUMO (Energy of the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital)"
