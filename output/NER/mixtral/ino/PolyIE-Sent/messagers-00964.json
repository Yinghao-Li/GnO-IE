The open-circuit voltage in this case is 0.80 volts.\n3. JSC: This stands for short-circuit current density, which is the current density that flows through a solar cell when it is short-circuited (i.e., when the voltage across the cell is zero). The short-circuit current density in this case is 13.1 milliamperes per square centimeter.\n4. FF: This stands for fill factor, which is a measure of the quality of a solar cell. The fill factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum power that can be produced by a solar cell to the product of the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density. The fill factor in this case is 0.67.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* Power conversion efficiency\n* VOC (open-circuit voltage)\n* JSC (short-circuit current density)\n* FF (fill factor)"
