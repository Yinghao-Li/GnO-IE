The ter-polymers: This is a general term for a type of material, specifically a polymer made up of three different types of monomers. In this context, it is likely that the ter-polymers are also made up of some combination of fluorene, thiophene, and benzothiadiazole monomers, but the specific abbreviation for these ter-polymers is not given in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are PFDTBT, PFD2TBT, and the ter-polymers."
