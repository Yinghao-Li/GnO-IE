      "content": "1. The first step is to identify the possible \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph. These entities are often nouns or noun phrases that refer to a specific property or characteristic of an object or concept.\n2. In the given paragraph, the following nouns and noun phrases could be potential \"Property Value\" entities:\n* ln(JL 3 / V 2 )\n* ( V / L ) 0.5\n* hole mobility\n* blend films of PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM (1:2, w/w)\n* blend films of PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM (1.5:1, w/w)\n* SCLC method\n3. Now, let's analyze each of these entities to determine if they represent a property or characteristic:\n* ln(JL 3 / V 2 ): This is a mathematical function that takes the natural logarithm of the ratio of two properties, JL 3 and V 2. It is not a property value itself, but rather a calculation based on two properties.\n* ( V / L ) 0.5: This is another mathematical function that takes the square root of the ratio of two properties, V and L. Like ln(JL 3 / V 2 ), it is not a property value but a calculation based on two properties.\n* hole mobility: This is a property of the blend films that measures the ability of holes (positive charges) to move through the material.\n* blend films of PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM (1:2, w/w) and blend films of PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM (1.5:1, w/w): These are specific blends of two materials with a particular weight ratio. While they are not property values themselves, they are objects being measured for a specific property (hole mobility).\n* SCLC method: This is a method for measuring the hole mobility of materials. It is not a property value, but rather a technique used to determine a property.\n4. Based on this analysis, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n* hole mobility\n* blend films of PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM (1:2, w/w) and blend films of PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM (1.5:1, w/w) in the context of their hole mobility."

Based on the analysis in the previous answer, the relevant \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n* hole mobility\n* blend films of PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM (1:2, w/w) and blend films of PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM (1.5:1, w/w) in the context of their hole mobility.\n2. To remove irrelevant entities, we can eliminate the following:\n* ln(JL 3 / V 2 )\n* ( V / L ) 0.5\n* SCLC method\n3. Therefore, the final list of \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph is:\n* hole mobility\n* blend films of PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM (1:2, w/w) with a hole mobility\n* blend films of PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM (1.5:1, w/w) with a hole mobility."
