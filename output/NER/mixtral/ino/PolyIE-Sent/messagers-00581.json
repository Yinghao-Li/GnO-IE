These concepts are used in molecular physics and quantum chemistry to describe the behavior of materials at the atomic and molecular level. Therefore, LUMO and HOMO are clear examples of Material Name entities.\n\nThe other terms in the paragraph, such as \"energies\" and \"optical bandgap energies,\" are more general concepts that are not specific to any particular material.
