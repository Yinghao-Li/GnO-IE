It is a measure of the current produced by a solar cell under short-circuit conditions, i.e., when the voltage across the cell is zero.\n3. V OC: Stands for Open-Circuit Voltage. It is the maximum voltage that can be produced by a solar cell in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is flowing through it.\n4. FF: Stands for Fill Factor.
