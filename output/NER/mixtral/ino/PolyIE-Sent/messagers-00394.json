In this context, it is likely being used as a component in the formation of a new material.\n2. Conjugated polymers - This is another material name. Conjugated polymers are a type of polymer with alternating double and single bonds, which can conduct electricity and are used in various applications such as organic electronics.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are \"flat perylene\" and \"conjugated polymers.\""
