BT - based analogue PzNDTDTBT: Here, \"BT\" is likely referring to a specific chemical group or unit, but without more context it's difficult to determine the exact property name. However, we can include it as a potential property name.\n2. stronger electron - accepting BO unit: \"BO\" is likely a chemical group or unit, and it is described as having a property of being a \"stronger electron-accepting\" unit.\n3. intramolecular charge transfer: This is a process or property involved in the movement of charge within a molecule.\n4. HOMO energy level: HOMO stands for \"Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital,\" which is a property of a molecule related to its energy levels.\n5. organic semiconductor: This is a type of material with specific electrical properties.\n6. PCE: This stands for \"Power Conversion Efficiency,\" which is a property or performance metric for solar cells.\n7. additive: In this context, \"additive\" likely refers to a substance added to the blend of materials in the solar cell, but it is not a specific property name.\n8. thermal annealing: This is a process used to modify the properties of materials, but it is not a specific property name.\n\nSo, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* BT (if it is a property name)\n* BO (if it is a property name)\n* intramolecular charge transfer\n* HOMO energy level\n* PCE\n* thermal annealing (if it is considered a property)"
