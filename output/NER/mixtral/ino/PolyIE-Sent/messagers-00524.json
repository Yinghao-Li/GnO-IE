Now, let's determine if these entities are indeed \"Property Value\" entities.\n\t* alternating copolymer: This is a type of polymer, so it is a \"Property Value\" entity.\n\t* PSFDTBT: This is a specific name for the copolymer, so it is a \"Property Value\" entity.\n\t* spirobifluorene: This is a type of organic compound, so it is a \"Property Value\" entity."

After reviewing the potential \"Property Value\" entities identified in the previous step, we can remove irrelevant entities by considering whether they clearly refer to the value of a material property.\n2. In this case, the relevant \"Property Value\" entities are:\n\t* PSFDTBT: This is a specific name for the copolymer, and it is a \"Property Value\" entity because it refers to the material that was designed and synthesized.\n\t* spirobifluorene: This is a type of organic compound that is one of the units in the copolymer, so it is a \"Property Value\" entity because it refers to a property of the material.\n3. The entity \"alternating copolymer\" can be considered a \"Property Value\" entity, but it is too general and does not provide specific information about the material being described. Therefore, we can remove it from the list of relevant \"Property Value\" entities.\n4. The entity \"2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole unit\" is also a \"Property Value\" entity because it is one of the units in the copolymer and refers to a property of the material. However, since it is not explicitly mentioned as having a specific value of a material property, we can remove it from the list of relevant \"Property Value\" entities.\n5. In summary, the relevant \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\t* PSFDTBT\n\t* spirobifluorene"
