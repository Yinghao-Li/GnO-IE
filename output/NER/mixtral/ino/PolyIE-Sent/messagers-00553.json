A \"Property Value\" entity typically refers to a specific numerical or quantifiable value that describes a property or attribute of something.\n3. In the given paragraph, there are two potential \"Property Value\" entities:\n   - \"21.8 Å\"\n   - \"2d[sin θ ]\"\n4. To confirm if these entities are indeed \"Property Value\" entities, we need to consider the context in which they appear.\n5. The paragraph describes a lamellar d-spacing (d1) of 21.8 Å, which is a quantifiable value used to describe the distance between layers in a material.\n6. Therefore, \"21.8 Å\" can be confirmed as a \"Property Value\" entity.\n7. The expression \"2d[sin θ ]\" is a mathematical formula used to calculate the d-spacing value.\n8. While it is not a specific numerical value, it is still a quantifiable expression that describes the property of the material.\n9. Therefore, \"2d[sin θ ]\" can also be considered a \"Property Value\" entity, although it is not a specific numerical value.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are \"21.8 Å\" and \"2d[sin θ ]\"."
