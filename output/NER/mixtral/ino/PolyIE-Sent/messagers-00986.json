The first material name to identify is \"9,10-arene functionalized anthracene.\" This is a specific type of copolymer that is used as a base material for constructing other copolymers.\n2. The second material name is \"polymers.\" In this context, the term \"polymers\" refers to the copolymers based on 9,10-arene functionalized anthracene.\n3. The third material name is \"wavelengths.\" Although not a traditional material, wavelengths are a type of physical property that can be measured and are often associated with materials, particularly in the context of light absorption.\n4. The final material name is \"PCEs,\" which stands for power conversion efficiencies. PCE is a measure of the efficiency of a material in converting light into electrical energy, and is often used as a metric for evaluating the performance of solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are:\n\n* 9,10-arene functionalized anthracene\n* polymers\n* wavelengths\n* PCEs."
