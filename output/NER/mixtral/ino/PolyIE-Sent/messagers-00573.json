Now, let's analyze each entity to determine if they are indeed \"Property Name\" entities.\n4. Maxima absorption spectra: This is a property of a material or substance that describes the specific wavelengths of light that it absorbs most strongly. Therefore, it can be considered a \"Property Name\" entity.\n5. Red-shifted: This is a property that describes a change in the wavelength of light as it moves away from its source. In this context, it is being used to describe a change in the absorption spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB. Therefore, it can also be considered a \"Property Name\" entity.\n6. 9-2"
