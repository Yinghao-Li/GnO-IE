The first step is to identify the entities in the paragraph that might represent \"Property Values.\" These could include any numerical values, descriptive words, or phrases that describe the properties or characteristics of the objects or processes mentioned in the paragraph.\n2.

After identifying the potential \"Property Values,\" we need to determine which ones are actually being used to describe the properties of the copolymers.\n4. In this case, the \"Property Values\" being described are:\n* The photovoltaic properties of copolymers\n* The optimum blend ratio of polymer : PC71BM, which is 1 : 2\n* The best PCE of both copolymers, which is not explicitly stated in the paragraph but can be inferred from the context.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Values\" in this paragraph are:\n\n* Photovoltaic properties\n* Optimum blend ratio of 1 : 2\n* Best PCE."
