      "content": "1. The first step is to identify the potential \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph.\n2. A \"Property Value\" entity refers to a specific property or characteristic of a material or object, along with the value or measurement of that property.\n3. In the given paragraph, the potential \"Property Value\" entities are:\n   - \"a large shoulder peak\"\n   - \"800 nm\"\n   - \"no shoulder peaks\"\n   - \"stronger intermolecular interaction\"\n4. Now, let's determine which of these entities are \"Property Value\" entities:\n   - \"a large shoulder peak\" is a property of the PDTP-BT film, but it does not have a specific value associated with it, so it is not a \"Property Value\" entity.\n   - \"800 nm\" is a value associated with the wavelength of light, and it is a property of the shoulder peak observed in the PDTP-BT film, so it is a \"Property Value\" entity.\n   - \"no shoulder peaks\" is a property of the PDTP-DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT films, but it does not have a specific value associated with it, so it is not a \"Property Value\" entity.\n   - \"stronger intermolecular interaction\" is a property of the PDTP-BT film, but it does not have a specific value associated with it, so it is not a \"Property Value\" entity.\n5. Therefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n   - \"800 nm\" (wavelength of light)\n\nNote: The other entities mentioned in the paragraph are important for understanding the context, but they do not meet the criteria for \"Property Value\" entities."
