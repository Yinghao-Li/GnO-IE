It is a type of polymer used in organic photovoltaics.\n* BHJ devices: No, this is not a material. It is a type of device (bulk-heterojunction) used in organic photovoltaics.\n* [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ): Yes, this is a material. It is a fullerene derivative used as an electron acceptor in organic photovoltaics.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"PCDSeBT\" and \"[6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM )\"."
