Therefore, we cannot identify any \"Material Name\" entities from the word \"polymers\" itself.\n2. However, the sentence \"which indicates that some degree of crystallinity has been formed at room temperature\" implies that the samples being discussed are made of crystalline materials.\n3. The first sentence mentions that \"obvious diffraction peaks were detected\" before annealing the samples. Diffraction peaks are typically observed in X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments, which are used to determine the crystal structure of materials.\n4. Therefore, it can be inferred that the samples being discussed are likely to be crystalline materials that can be analyzed using XRD techniques.\n5. However, the paragraph does not provide any specific names of the materials being discussed.\n\nConclusion: Based on the given paragraph, we cannot identify any specific \"Material Name\" entities."
