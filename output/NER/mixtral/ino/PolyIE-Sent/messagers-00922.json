The second material name entity is \"2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene.\" This is another type of organic compound that consists of a thiophene ring with two 2-ethylhexyloxy groups and a propylenedioxy group attached to it.\n3. The third material name entity is \"BT.\" Based on the context, BT is likely referring to benzothiadiazole, which is a common electron-deficient unit used in organic electronic materials.\n4. The fourth material name entity is \"all - donor homopolymer.\" This refers to a type of polymer that is made up of only donor units. In this case, the donor unit is likely to be one of the two types of oligomers or polymers mentioned earlier.\n\nTherefore, the material name entities in the paragraph are \"3,4bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene,\" \"2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene,\" \"BT,\" and \"all - donor homopolymer.\""
