It stands for open-circuit voltage, which is a parameter used to characterize the performance of solar cells.\n4. J SC: This is not a material name. It stands for short-circuit current density, which is another parameter used to characterize the performance of solar cells.\n5. FF: This is not a material name. It stands for fill factor, which is a measure of the quality of a solar cell.\n6. PCE: This is not a material name.
