Alkyl side chains are organic compounds that consist of a hydrocarbon chain with a terminal methyl group.\n2. the backbone of the polymer: This is not a \"Material Name\" entity. A polymer backbone refers to the main chain of atoms in a polymer molecule, and it can be made up of various types of atoms and chemical groups.\n3. the solvent used: This is not a \"Material Name\" entity. A solvent is a substance that is capable of dissolving other substances, and it can be made up of various types of chemicals.\n4. temperature: This is not a \"Material Name\" entity. Temperature is a measure of the heat energy of a substance, and it is not a material itself.\n5. thin films: This is not a \"Material Name\" entity. Thin films are thin layers of material that are typically measured in nanometers or micrometers.\n6. ∼ 780 nm: This is not a \"Material Name\" entity. This is a wavelength of light in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n7. ∼ 1.6 eV: This is not a \"Material Name\" entity. This is a unit of energy called an electronvolt (eV), which is commonly used in physics and chemistry.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* alkyl side chains"
