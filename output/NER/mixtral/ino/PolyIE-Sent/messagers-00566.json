A \"Property\" refers to a characteristic or attribute of something, while a \"Value\" is the degree or level to which that characteristic or attribute is present.\n3.

Now, let's analyze each of these entities to determine if they represent a \"Property Value\" relationship:\n\t* \"π-π stacking\": This is a property of the molecules in PQCDTB and PCZDTB.\n\t* \"more effective\": This is a value that describes the degree to which the property of \"π-π stacking\" is present in PQCDTB compared to PCZDTB.\n\t* \"coplanarity of the quinacridone unit\": This is a property of the quinacridone unit in PQCDTB.\n\t* \"introduced to the main chain of PQCDTB\": This is a value that describes the location of the quinacridone unit in PQCDTB.\n5. Based on this analysis, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\t* Property: \"π-π stacking\"\n\t* Value: \"more effective\"\n\t* Property: \"coplanarity of the quinacridone unit\"\n\t* Value: \"introduced to the main chain of PQCDTB\"\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are: π-π stacking, more effective, coplanarity of the quinacridone unit, and introduced to the main chain of PQCDTB."
