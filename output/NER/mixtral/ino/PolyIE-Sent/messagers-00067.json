In this paragraph, the potential \"Property Name\" entities are: \"HOMO\", \"π-conjugation framework\", \"LUMO\", and \"benzothiadiazole unit\".\n3. Now, let's check if these entities refer to properties or characteristics of something.\n4. \"HOMO\" and \"LUMO\" are abbreviations for \"Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital\" and \"Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital\", respectively. They are properties of a molecule that describe the energy levels of its electrons.\n5. \"π-conjugation framework\" refers to the arrangement of atoms in a molecule that allows for the delocalization of electrons in a π bond. This is a property of the molecule's structure.\n6. \"Benzothiadiazole unit\" refers to a specific chemical structure that is a component of the molecule. While it is not a property in the same sense as the others, it is still a characteristic that is relevant to the discussion of the molecule's properties.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* HOMO\n* π-conjugation framework\n* LUMO\n* benzothiadiazole unit"
