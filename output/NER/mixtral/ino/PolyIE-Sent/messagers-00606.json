The first material name to identify is \"polymer / PCBM blend film.\" This is a single material made up of a blend of a polymer and PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester), a fullerene derivative commonly used as an electron transport layer in organic solar cells.\n2. The second material name is \"AFM probe\" or \"AFM tip,\" which is implied in the phrase \"atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed.\" The AFM probe is a sharp, physical probe that scans the surface of a sample to generate topographic information. However, since the paragraph does not explicitly mention the AFM probe, we can only infer its presence.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are:\n\n* Polymer / PCBM blend film\n* (Implied) AFM probe or AFM tip"
