A property name is a type of noun that refers to a characteristic or attribute of a person, place, or thing.\n3. In the given paragraph, the potential property name entities are:\n   - \"result\"\n   - \"π-π stacking\"\n   - \"d π\"\n4. Now, let's check the context of each entity to determine if they are indeed property names.\n5. \"Result\" is not a property name, as it refers to the outcome of an experiment or calculation, rather than a characteristic or attribute.\n6. \"π-π stacking\" is a type of interaction between aromatic rings, and thus can be considered a property name.\n7. \"d π\" is a distance measurement related to the π-π stacking interaction, and thus can also be considered a property name.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the given paragraph are \"π-π stacking\" and \"d π\"."
