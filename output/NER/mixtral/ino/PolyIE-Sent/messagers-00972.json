In this case, the material name is \"DPP-based conjugated polymers.\" DPP stands for diketopyrrolopyrrole, which is a common electron-deficient building block used in organic photovoltaic materials. The phrase \"conjugated polymers\" refers to a class of materials with alternating single and double bonds, which are often used in optoelectronic applications due to their excellent charge transport properties. Therefore, \"DPP-based conjugated polymers\" refer to a specific type of material that is made by combining DPP with other electron-donating building blocks to create a polymer with conjugated electronic structure."
