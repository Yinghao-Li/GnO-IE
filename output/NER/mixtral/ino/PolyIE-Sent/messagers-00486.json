In the sentence \"In comparison with the absorption spectrum in solution, the absorption spectrum in film became broader and red-shifted for about 35 nm...\", the two potential candidates for \"Material Name\" entities are \"solution\" and \"film.\"\n3. To confirm if these entities are indeed \"Material Name,\" we need to consider the context and definition of \"Material Name.\" \"Material Name\" refers to the name of a material or substance that is being discussed or referred to in a scientific or technical context.\n4. In this paragraph, the context is about the absorption spectrum of a polymer in different states, specifically in solution and in film.\n5. Therefore, it is clear that \"solution\" and \"film\" are being used to refer to the states or forms of the polymer material.\n6. Hence, \"solution\" and \"film\" can be identified as \"Material Name\" entities in this paragraph."
