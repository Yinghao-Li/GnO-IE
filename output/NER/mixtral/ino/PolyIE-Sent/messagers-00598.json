PCZDTB - This appears to be a proper noun, possibly a type of material or compound. It is not clear if it is a \"Property Name\" entity.\n4. Decrease of series resistance - \"Series resistance\" is a property name that refers to the resistance of a device or material when current flows through it in series.\n5.
