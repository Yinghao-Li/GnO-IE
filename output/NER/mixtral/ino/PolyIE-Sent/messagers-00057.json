Absorption peaks are a property of a material or solution, and the wavelengths at which they occur are specific values. In this case, the first two absorption peaks blue-shift (move towards shorter wavelengths) to new wavelength ranges: 380-420 nm and 520-560 nm. These wavelength ranges are the \"Property Value\" entities because they describe the specific values of the absorption peaks after the blue-shift.\n\n2. The second entity: \"the third absorption is highly temperature-dependent which becomes a shoulder peak at high temperature\"\n\t* Here, there is no specific \"Property Value\" entity mentioned.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* In this part of the paragraph, the author mentions a third absorption peak that is highly dependent on temperature. However, the text does not provide specific values for the temperature or the resulting shoulder peak wavelength. Therefore, there is no \"Property Value\" entity in this part of the text."
