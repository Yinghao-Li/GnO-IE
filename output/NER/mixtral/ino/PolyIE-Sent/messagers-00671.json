Therefore, 'absorbance maximum' is a \"Property Name\" in this paragraph.\n2. 496 nm: This is the value of the wavelength at which the absorbance maximum occurs. It is not a property name but rather a property value.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entity in the paragraph is 'absorbance maximum.'"
