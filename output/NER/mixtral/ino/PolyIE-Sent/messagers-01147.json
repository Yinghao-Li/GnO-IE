It is defined as the ratio of the maximum power that can be delivered by the cell to the product of the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current.\n4. PCE - PCE stands for power conversion efficiency, which is a measure of the efficiency with which a solar cell or photovoltaic device converts sunlight into electrical energy.\n\nNone of these entities are \"material names\" in the traditional sense, as they are properties or characteristics of solar cells or photovoltaic devices, rather than being names of specific materials.
