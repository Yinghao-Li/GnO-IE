It is a property that represents the device's overall performance. So, \"higher FF\" is a property name.\n2. POBDTPD device: This is the name of a specific device, not a property.\n3. balance: This is a general term and not a property name in this context.\n4. hole mobility: This is a property that represents the speed at which charge carriers (holes) can move through a material. So, \"hole mobility\" is a property name.\n5. electron mobility: This is a property that represents the speed at which charge carriers (electrons) can move through a material. So, \"electron mobility\" is a property name.\n\nTherefore, the property names in the paragraph are \"higher FF\", \"hole mobility\", and \"electron mobility\"."
