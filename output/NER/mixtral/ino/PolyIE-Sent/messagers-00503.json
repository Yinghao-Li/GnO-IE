The sentence \"the photovoltaic performance of PSFDTBT was investigated in PSCs\" describes an action that was taken (investigating the photovoltaic performance of PSFDTBT in PSCs), but it does not specify any particular property or value associated with those entities.\n\nIf you have a different paragraph or a more specific question, I would be happy to help further!"
