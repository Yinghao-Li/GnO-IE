The context suggests that \"P2\" is a material, but more information is needed to specify the exact material.\n2. Similarly, the term \"P1\" also refers to a material, but it is not a complete material name in itself.\n3. Since the paragraph compares the absorption maxima of P2 and P1, it can be inferred that both P1 and P2 are likely to be the names of chemical compounds or materials.\n4. However, without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately identify the complete \"Material Name\" entities for P1 and P2.\n\nTherefore, based on the given paragraph, the \"Material Name\" entities are \"P1\" and \"P2,\" but their complete names cannot be identified without additional context or information."
