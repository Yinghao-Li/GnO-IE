The first mention of a material name is \"films\" in the phrase \"With film annealing treatments...\" Here, \"films\" refers to a thin layer of material, typically solid, that is deposited on a substrate to form a functional surface.\n2. The second material name is \"crystal grains\" in the phrase \"the films form larger crystal grains...\". Crystal grains refer to the small, three-dimensional volume elements of a material that have a crystalline structure.\n3. The third material name is \"film interconnectivity\" in the phrase \"and better film interconnectivity...\". Film interconnectivity refers to the degree of connection or interaction between the individual grains within a film.\n4. The fourth material name is \"charge\" in the phrase \"which are favorable for the charge transport...\". While not a material in the traditional sense, \"charge\" is a physical property that is closely associated with materials, particularly in the context of semiconductors and other electronic devices.\n5. The fifth material name is \"mobility\" in the phrase \"lead to an increase of the mobility...\". Mobility is a measure of how easily charge carriers (such as electrons or holes) can move through a material in response to an electric field.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are \"films\", \"crystal grains\", \"charge\", and \"mobility\"."

Improved film interconnectivity can also enhance charge transport and mobility, as it allows for more efficient communication between adjacent grains.\n3. \"an increase of the mobility\" - This is the final \"Property Value\" entity in the paragraph. Mobility refers to the ability of charge carriers (such as electrons or holes) to move through a material. An increase in mobility is generally a desirable property, as it can lead to improved performance in electronic devices.\n\nOverall, the \"Property Value\" entities in this paragraph all relate to the improved performance of films with annealing treatments.
