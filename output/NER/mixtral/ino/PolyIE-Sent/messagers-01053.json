D-A stands for \"donor-acceptor,\" which refers to a type of molecular structure where one part of the molecule (the donor) is electron-rich and the other part (the acceptor) is electron-poor.\n2. \"band gap (Eg)\" - This is not a \"Material Name\" entity, but rather a property of a material. The band gap (Eg) is a measure of the energy required to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band in a solid material.\n3. \"the resultant polymers\" - This is not a specific \"Material Name\" entity, but rather a general term that could refer to any number of different polymer materials.\n4. \"polymeric main chain\" - This is not a specific \"Material Name\" entity, but rather a general term that could refer to the backbone structure of any number of different polymer materials.\n\nTherefore, the only \"Material Name\" entity in the paragraph is \"side-chain D-A structure.\""
