An exciton is a bound state of an electron and an electron hole which are attracted to each other by the Coulomb force.\n3. polymer: This is a material name, as it refers to a large molecule composed of repeating subunits. In this context, it is likely referring to a type of conjugated polymer used in organic electronics.\n4.
