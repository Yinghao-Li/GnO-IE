In this paragraph, the potential \"Property Value\" entities are:\n   - \"available\" (this could be a property of a set of materials)\n   - \"classes of materials\" (this is a general property that categorizes a set of items)\n   - \"thiophenefused polycyclic heteroaromatics\" (this is a specific type of material)\n   - \"high charge transport properties\" (this is the main \"Property Value\" entity in the paragraph)\n3. After identifying the potential \"Property Value\" entities, we can narrow down the list to the entities that are most directly related to the main topic of the paragraph.\n4. In this case, the main topic of the paragraph is the \"high charge transport properties\" of thiophenefused polycyclic heteroaromatics.
