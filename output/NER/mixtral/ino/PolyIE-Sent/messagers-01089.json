EQE curve: This term likely refers to the external quantum efficiency curve, which is a graphical representation of the efficiency of a solar cell or photodetector as a function of wavelength or photon energy. However, it is not a \"Property Value\" itself.\n2. solar irradiation spectrum: This term refers to the distribution of solar radiation as a function of wavelength or frequency. It is not a \"Property Value\" itself.\n3. 9.70 mA cm^-2: This term is a numerical value representing the integral current density of the device, which is a property of the device. Therefore, it is a \"Property Value\" entity.\n\nTo summarize, the \"Property Value\" entity in the paragraph is:\n\n* 9.70 mA cm^-2 (integral current density value of the device)"
