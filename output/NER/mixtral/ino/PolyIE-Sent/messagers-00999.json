The first mention of a material in the paragraph is \"the solution state.\" However, \"solution state\" refers to the physical state of a material, rather than a specific material itself. Therefore, it is not a \"Material Name\" entity.\n2. The next mention is \"the solid state.\" Like \"solution state,\" \"solid state\" is a physical state of a material and not a specific material.\n3. The paragraph then mentions \"polymer chains.\" Polymers are a type of material made up of large molecules composed of repeating subunits. Therefore, \"polymer chains\" is a \"Material Name\" entity.\n4. Finally, the paragraph mentions \"crystallization,\" which is a process that can occur in materials, particularly in polymers. However, it is not a specific material, so it is not a \"Material Name\" entity.\n\nTo summarize, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"polymer chains.\""
