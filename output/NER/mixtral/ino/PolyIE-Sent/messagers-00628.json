The first step is to identify the entities in the paragraph that could potentially represent \"Property Values.\" These are usually nouns or noun phrases that describe a specific attribute or characteristic of something.\n2. In this paragraph, the potential \"Property Value\" entities are:\n* all-polymer solar cells\n* power conversion efficiencies (PCEs)\n* 1.5%\n* AM1.5\n* 100 mW cm^-2\n3. Next, we need to determine which of these entities actually represent property values.\n* \"all-polymer solar cells\" is the object being described, not a property value.\n* \"power conversion efficiencies (PCEs)\" is a property of the all-polymer solar cells, but it is not a specific value.\n* \"1.5%\" is a specific value that represents the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the all-polymer solar cells.\n* \"AM1.5\" is a standardized measurement condition for solar cells, not a property value.\n* \"100 mW cm^-2\" is also a standardized measurement condition for solar cells, not a property value.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* 1.5% (representing the power conversion efficiency of the all-polymer solar cells)"
