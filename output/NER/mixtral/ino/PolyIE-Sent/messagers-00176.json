Next, we need to determine which of these entities are actually being described or attributed with a specific property or value.\n* Absorption is described as being \"in the shorter wavelength.\"\n* The transition from HOMO to LUMO+1 is described as being \"similar to π-π\\* transition in polythiophene.\"\n* The shape of the orbitals is described as being similar to the π-π\\* transition in polythiophene.\n4.
