It refers to the process of breaking down an exciton, which is a bound state of an electron and a hole, into its constituent particles.\n3. \"Complementary absorption\" is also a property name entity in the paragraph. It refers to the ability of two materials to absorb different wavelengths or frequencies of light, allowing for a broader range of light absorption when used together.\n\nTherefore, the property name entities in the paragraph are \"LUMO-LUMO offset\", \"exciton dissociation\", and \"complementary absorption\"."
