An alkyl side chain is a type of chemical structure often found in organic semiconductors.\n2. processing temperature - While not a material in the traditional sense, processing temperature can be considered a \"Material Name\" entity in this context since it refers to the temperature at which the active layer material is processed or treated.\n3. BHJ PSC - This stands for Bulk Heterojunction Photovoltaic Solar Cell, which is a type of organic solar cell. BHJ PSC is not a specific material but a general category of materials and devices. Therefore, it is not a \"Material Name\" entity in this context.\n4. active layer - This is a \"Material Name\" entity. The active layer is the layer in a photovoltaic cell where charge generation and separation occur.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"alkyl side chain\" and \"active layer.\""
