The \"branched\" part is an adjective describing the structure, while \"2ethylhexyl side chain\" is the main property name entity here. It refers to a type of chemical side chain with a specific arrangement of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n2. \"a linear n-octyl group\" - This is another property name entity. It refers to a type of chemical group with a linear arrangement of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The \"n\" in \"n-octyl\" is a variable that can take on different values, but in this context, it likely refers to a normal octyl group, which has 8 carbon atoms.\n3. \"PTB7-Th derivative\" - This is a property name entity that refers to a class of chemical compounds that are derived from a parent compound called PTB7-Th.\n4. \"PBTT\" - This is also a property name entity, which refers to a specific chemical compound that is synthesized by replacing the branched 2ethylhexyl side chain with a linear n-octyl group in the PTB7-Th derivative.\n\nTherefore, the property name entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* branched 2ethylhexyl side chain\n* linear n-octyl group\n* PTB7-Th derivative\n* PBTT"
