A property value is a characteristic or attribute of a noun.\n3. In this paragraph, the noun \"isothianaphthene imides\" is modified by the adjective \"new,\" which describes a property of the imides.\n4. Additionally, the noun \"compounds\" is modified by the phrase \"with high property value,\" which suggests that the compounds have certain desirable properties.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* New (property of isothianaphthene imides)\n* High property value (property of compounds)"
