A \"Property Value\" entity typically refers to a specific characteristic or attribute of an object or concept.\n3. In the given paragraph, the following entities could be considered as \"Property Value\" entities:\n\t* J SC\n\t* IPCE data\n\t* AM 1.5G reference spectrum\n\t* 10% error\n4. However, not all of these entities are \"Property Value\" entities in the context of the paragraph.\n5. The main focus of the paragraph is on the comparison of two values of J SC, one obtained from integrating IPCE data with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum and the other from J-V plots.\n6. Therefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in this paragraph are:\n\t* J SC value obtained from integrating IPCE data with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum\n\t* J SC value obtained from J-V plots\n\t* 10% error\n7.

After reviewing the entities identified in the previous answer, we can remove the following entities that do not clearly refer to the value of a material property:\n\t* IPCE data\n\t* AM 1.5G reference spectrum\n\t* J-V plots\n2. These entities are not \"Property Value\" entities themselves, but rather describe the methods or data used to obtain the values of the material property.\n3. Therefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\t* J SC value obtained from integrating IPCE data with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum\n\t* J SC value obtained from J-V plots\n\t* 10% error\n4.
