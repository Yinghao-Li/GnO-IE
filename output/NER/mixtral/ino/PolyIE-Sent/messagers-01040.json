Fibril morphology refers to the physical shape and structure of fibrils, which are thread-like protein aggregates.\n2. \"exciton dissociation\" - This is another potential \"Property Name\" entity in the paragraph. Exciton dissociation refers to the process by which an excited state (exciton) in a material is separated into its component parts (electron and hole), which can then move independently and contribute to electrical conductivity.\n3. \"PL quenching experiment\" - This is a third potential \"Property Name\" entity in the paragraph. PL quenching refers to a phenomenon in which the intensity of photoluminescence (PL) is reduced due to the presence of a quencher that can accept energy from the excited state and dissipate it as heat. A PL quenching experiment is a type of experiment that measures the change in PL intensity in the presence of a quencher, and can be used to study various properties of materials, including exciton dissociation.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Fibril morphology\n2. Exciton dissociation\n3. PL quenching experiment"
