Energy level alignment control: This refers to the ability to control the energy levels of the ladder-type PCDTBTs, which is important for efficient charge transfer in BHJ devices.\n2. Charge carrier mobility: This is a measure of how quickly charge carriers can move through a material, which is crucial for the performance of BHJ devices.\n\nThese \"Property Value\" entities are implied in the original paragraph, but they are not explicitly stated.
