It is not a \"Property Value\" entity.\n   - \"Visible region\" is a noun phrase that refers to a specific range of wavelengths in the absorption spectra. It is a \"Property Value\" entity.\n   - \"Intrinsic absorptions\" is a noun phrase that refers to the inherent ability of the polymers and PC71BM to absorb light.
