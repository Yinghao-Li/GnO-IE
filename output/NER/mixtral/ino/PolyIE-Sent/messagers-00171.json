It is a property value in this context, as it refers to the peak wavelength of the PDTP-DT2BT material.\n* PDTP-DT2BT: This is an abbreviation for a specific material. While it is not a property value itself, it is the subject of the sentence and has a property (peak wavelength) associated with it.\n* the broadening of the optical band: This is a descriptive phrase that refers to a change in a property of the material, but it is not a specific property value.\n* the optical band gap: This is a property of the material, but it is not a specific property value in this context.\n* sequence: This is a general term and does not represent a specific property value in this context.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* 750 nm (peak wavelength of the PDTP-DT2BT material)"
