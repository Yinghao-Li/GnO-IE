The first entity that could be considered as a \"Property Value\" is \"measured PCE.\" PCE stands for Power Conversion Efficiency, which is a property of a solar cell or photovoltaic device that measures the efficiency of converting light into electrical power. Here, the property value is \"measured,\" indicating the numerical value of the PCE that was obtained from a measurement.\n2. The second entity that could be considered as a \"Property Value\" is \"photovoltaic values.\" This term is more general than PCE and could refer to any property related to the photovoltaic performance of a device. However, in this context, it is likely that the author is referring to the same property as before, i.e., PCE. Therefore, \"photovoltaic values\" could be interpreted as another way of referring to the PCE of the device.\n\nIn summary, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are \"measured PCE\" and \"photovoltaic values,\" both of which likely refer to the Power Conversion Efficiency of the photovoltaic device."
