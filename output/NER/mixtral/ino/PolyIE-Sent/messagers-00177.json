The first material name to identify is \"thienyl spacer.\" A spacer is a type of material that is used to separate or connect other materials, and in this case, the spacer is made of thienyl, which is a type of organic compound.\n2. The second material name is \"LUMO+1 ( π* ).\" LUMO stands for Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital, and it refers to the energy level of the highest unoccupied electron orbital in a molecule. The \"+1\" indicates that this is the first excited state of the LUMO. The \"π*\" refers to a type of molecular orbital that is formed by the side-to-side overlap of atomic orbitals, and it is often associated with the absorption of light in organic compounds.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are \"thienyl spacer\" and \"LUMO+1 ( π* ).\""

Now, let's analyze each of these entities to determine if they represent a property and a value:\n\t* \"more thienyl spacer\" - This entity does not clearly represent a property and a value. It seems to be more of a description of a modification made to a system.\n\t* \"better conjugation\" - This entity represents a property (conjugation) and a value (better).\n\t* \"the red-shift of the absorption band\" - This entity represents a property (absorption band) and a value (red-shift).\n5.
