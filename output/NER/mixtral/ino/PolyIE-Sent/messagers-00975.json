Heteroarenes are aromatic organic compounds containing at least one heteroatom (an atom that is not carbon), and fused heteroarenes refer to heteroarenes that are fused together to form a larger molecule.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are \"DPP-based copolymers\" and \"fused heteroarenes.\""

DPP-based copolymers: This is a \"Property Name\" entity as it refers to a type of copolymer (a polymer made up of two or more different monomers) that is based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moieties.\n2. Low band-gaps: This is another \"Property Name\" entity as it refers to the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in a semiconductor material. A smaller band-gap allows for better absorption of light in a wider range of wavelengths, which is desirable for solar cell applications.\n3. Excellent charge transport characteristics: This is a \"Property Name\" entity as it refers to the ability of charge carriers (such as electrons and holes) to move through a material. Good charge transport characteristics are important for solar cell performance, as they allow for efficient collection of charge carriers and reduced recombination losses.\n4. High short circuit current density (JSC): This is a \"Property Name\" entity as it refers to the current density generated by a solar cell under short-circuit conditions, where the voltage across the cell is zero. A high JSC indicates that the cell is able to generate a large amount of current under illumination, which is desirable for high power output."
