Polymers are large molecules made up of repeating subunits, and they are an important class of materials with a wide range of applications.\n3. HOMO and LUMO energy levels - HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) are energy levels associated with the electronic structure of materials, so they are not \"Material Name\" entities. However, they are important properties of materials that can be determined using techniques like cyclic voltammetry.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are: polymers."
