HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT: The text states that \"The HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT was determined to be -5.40 eV.\" Here, HOMO energy level is a property, and -5.40 eV is the value assigned to that property. Therefore, -5.40 eV is a \"Property Value\" entity.\n2. Onset oxidation potential (E ox): Although the onset oxidation potential is not explicitly given in the text, it is part of the equation used to determine the HOMO energy level. The property value for E ox can be calculated using the given equation and the HOMO energy level value.
