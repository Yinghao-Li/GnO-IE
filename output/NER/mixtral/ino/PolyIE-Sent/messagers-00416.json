An optical bandgap is the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in a material, which determines its optical properties.\n3. HOMO / LUMO energy levels: This is a \"Material Name\" entity. HOMO and LUMO refer to the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, respectively, in a material.
