J sc: This stands for \"Short-Circuit Current Density.\" It is the current density (current per unit area) that a solar cell or photovoltaic device produces when it is short-circuited, meaning that there is no voltage across the device.\n4. FF: This stands for \"Fill Factor.\" It is a measure of the quality of a solar cell or photovoltaic device. A high fill factor indicates that the device can convert a higher proportion of the available sunlight into usable electrical energy.\n\nIn summary, the \"Property Name\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* PCE\n* V oc\n* J sc\n* FF"
