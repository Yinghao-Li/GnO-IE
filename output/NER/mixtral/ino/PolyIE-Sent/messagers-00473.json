The next entity to consider is \"spirobifluorene.\" This is a specific chemical compound, and it is mentioned as one of the units to which the octyloxy chains are attached. Therefore, \"spirobifluorene\" can be considered a \"Property Value\" entity, as it is a property of the compound that contributes to its solubility.\n3. The final entity to consider is \"2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole units.\" This is another specific chemical compound, and it is mentioned as one of the units to which the octyloxy chains are attached.
