Since the prompt asks for \"Property Value\" entities, we need to determine if \"PC 70 BM\" has a property value associated with it. However, the paragraph does not provide any specific property value for \"PC 70 BM.\"\n2. The next entities to consider are \"chlorobenzene\" and \"1,8-diiodooctane.\" These are both chemical compounds that act as solvents for the polymer blend. Again, we need to determine if there is a property value associated with either of these compounds.\n3. The paragraph states that the solvents are in a \"volume ratio of 97 : 3.\" This is a property value associated with the solvents. Specifically, it indicates the relative volumes of chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane used in the solution.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are the volume ratio of chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane, which is 97 : 3."
