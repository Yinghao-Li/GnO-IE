J-V curves are a graphical representation of the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of a solar cell, which is a key property used to evaluate the performance of a solar cell.\n2. \"weight ratio of PSFDTBT : PC71BM\" - This is another property name in the paragraph. The weight ratio of PSFDTBT : PC71BM refers to the relative amount of two materials, PSFDTBT and PC71BM, used in the fabrication of the polymer solar cells. This property can significantly affect the performance of the solar cells.\n3. \"TCB solutions\" - This is a third property name in the paragraph. TCB (1,2,4-trichlorobenzene) is a solvent used in the fabrication of the solar cells, and the solutions are created by dissolving the materials in TCB. The properties of the TCB solutions, such as their concentration and purity, can affect the performance of the solar cells.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"J-V curves\", \"weight ratio of PSFDTBT : PC71BM\", and \"TCB solutions\"."
