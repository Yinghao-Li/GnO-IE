In this paragraph, the potential \"Property Name\" entities are:\n   - Dihedral angle\n   - Optimized structure\n   - Ethyl substitution\n   - Thienyl ring\n3. Now, let's check the definition of a \"Property Name\" entity:\n   - A property name is a noun or noun phrase that refers to a physical or chemical property of a system or a component of a system.\n4. Based on this definition, we can determine that the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n   - Dihedral angle\n   - Optimized structure\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Dihedral angle is a physical property that describes the angle between two planes or surfaces.\n* Optimized structure refers to the final geometry of a molecule or system after energy minimization or optimization, which is a computational chemistry technique. Therefore, it is a property of the system.\n\nNote:\n\n* Ethyl substitution and thienyl ring are not considered \"Property Name\" entities because they refer to specific components of the system rather than physical or chemical properties."
