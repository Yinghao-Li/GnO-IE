However, \"AM1.5 irradiation\" refers to a condition or situation (solar irradiation under air mass 1.5) rather than a specific material. Therefore, it cannot be considered a \"Material Name\" entity.\n2. The term \"EQE\" stands for External Quantum Efficiency, which is a ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by a solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy shining on the cell. It is a property of the solar cell and not a specific material. Hence, it is not a \"Material Name\" entity.\n3. The term \"I SC\" is mentioned multiple times, which stands for Short-Circuit Current. It is a parameter used to measure the performance of a solar cell and is not a specific material. Thus, it is not a \"Material Name\" entity.\n4. The term \"solar spectra\" refers to the distribution of solar radiation as a function of wavelength or frequency. It is not a specific material, so it is not a \"Material Name\" entity.\n\nBased on the provided paragraph, there are no \"Material Name\" entities present."
