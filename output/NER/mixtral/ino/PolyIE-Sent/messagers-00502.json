Appropriate HOMO/LUMO positions: This is the second \"Property Value\" entity. HOMO and LUMO are terms used in quantum chemistry to describe the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, respectively. The positions of these orbitals can affect the material's electronic properties and its ability to participate in charge transfer processes.\n3. Comparable hole mobility: This is the third \"Property Value\" entity. Hole mobility refers to the ability of a material to conduct positive charges. Comparable hole mobility suggests that PSFDTBT has a similar ability to conduct holes as other materials used in bulk heterojunction photovoltaic solar cells (BHJ PSCs)."
