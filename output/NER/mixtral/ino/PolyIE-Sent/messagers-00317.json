It could be a property value if it's a code or name for a specific material or compound, but we can't say for sure.\n3. The same applies to \"M2\" - it could be a property value if it's a code or name for a specific material or compound, but we can't say for sure without more context.\n4. \"Degassed toluene / water\" could be considered a property value, as it describes the solvent mixture used in the polymerization process.\n5. \"K 3 PO 4\" could be considered a property value, as it describes the organic base used in the polymerization process.\n6. \"Pd 2 ( dba ) 3\" could be considered a property value, as it describes the catalyst used in the polymerization process.\n7. \"P(o-tol) 3\" could be considered a property value, as it describes the ligand used in the polymerization process.\n8. \"90 °C\" could be considered a property value, as it describes the temperature at which the polymerization reaction took place.\n9. \"3 days\" could be considered a property value, as it describes the duration of the polymerization reaction.\n\nSo, in summary, the potential \"Property Value\" entities in this paragraph are:\n\n* Degassed toluene / water (solvent mixture)\n* K 3 PO 4 (organic base)\n* Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 (catalyst)\n* P(o-tol) 3 (ligand)\n* 90 °C (temperature)\n* 3 days (duration)\n\nNote that some of these entities could be more precisely defined with additional context."
