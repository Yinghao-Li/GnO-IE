However, \"fill factor\" is a property or characteristic, not a material. Therefore, it is not a \"Material Name\" entity.\n2. side-chain D-A conjugated copolymers: This is a type of material, specifically a class of polymers used in organic solar cells. Therefore, \"side-chain D-A conjugated copolymers\" is a \"Material Name\" entity.\n3. PBDT-TDPP-S: This is a specific type of side-chain D-A conjugated copolymer. Therefore, \"PBDT-TDPP-S\" is a \"Material Name\" entity.\n4. PC71BM: This is a fullerene derivative material commonly used as an electron transport layer in organic solar cells. Therefore, \"PC71BM\" is a \"Material Name\" entity.\n\nTo summarize, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"side-chain D-A conjugated copolymers,\" \"PBDT-TDPP-S,\" and \"PC71BM.\""
