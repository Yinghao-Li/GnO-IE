To identify material properties, you would typically need a paragraph or text that describes the properties of a specific material, such as its density, strength, or thermal conductivity.\n\nHere's an example of a paragraph that includes material property information:\n\n\"Steel is a popular construction material due to its high strength and durability. It has a density of approximately 7,850 kg/m^3, making it relatively heavy compared to other materials. Steel also has a high tensile strength, typically ranging from 250 to 1,000 MPa, depending on the specific alloy and heat treatment used. Additionally, steel has a thermal conductivity of around 50 W/(m*K), which is relatively high compared to other metals.\"\n\nIn this example, the material property entities are:\n\n* Density\n* Strength\n* Tensile strength\n* Thermal conductivity\n\nThese entities are clearly associated with the material \"steel\" and provide specific information about its properties."
