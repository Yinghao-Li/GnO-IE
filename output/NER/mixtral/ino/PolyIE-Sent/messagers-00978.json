The second material name is \"naphthalene.\" It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two benzene rings fused together.\n3. The third material name is \"DPP.\" It stands for diketopyrrolopyrrole, which is a common electron-deficient building block used in organic electronics.\n4. The fourth material name is \"PCEs.\" It stands for power conversion efficiencies, which is a property of organic solar cells. However, it is not a material name but a property of a material or device.\n5. The last material name is \"polymer with a strong electron-donating unit.\" Although it is not explicitly named, it is implied that this is a different type of polymer with a stronger electron-donating nature compared to the DPP-based copolymers with benzene or naphthalene groups.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are benzene, naphthalene, DPP, and a polymer with a strong electron-donating unit."
