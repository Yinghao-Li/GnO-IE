Therefore, \"benzothiadiazole\" is the material name in this context.\n\n2. Imine (-C=N-)\n\nThe text \"imine (-C=N-)\" refers to a functional group in organic chemistry, which is a compound containing a carbon atom double-bonded to a nitrogen atom. Therefore, \"imine\" is also a material name in this context, although it is a functional group rather than a specific compound.\n\nNote: I have corrected the formula for imine to the correct one, which is -C=N-."
