The paragraph also mentions that the copolymers have a \"low bandgap for efficient photon harvesting.\" Again, bandgap is not a material, but rather a property of a material related to its electronic structure.\n\nTherefore, the only material name entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"copolymers.\""
