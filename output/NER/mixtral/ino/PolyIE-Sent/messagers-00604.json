Therefore, \"PCZDTB\" can be identified as a \"Property Name\" entity, specifically a \"Material\" or \"Substance\" property.\n2. The second entity in the paragraph is \"EQE.\" In this context, EQE stands for External Quantum Efficiency, which is a property of a device. Therefore, \"EQE\" can be identified as a \"Property Name\" entity, specifically a \"Device Property.\"\n3. The third entity in the paragraph is \"48%.\" This is a numerical value representing the observed EQE at 440 nm. It is not a property name, but rather a property value.\n4. The fourth entity in the paragraph is \"440 nm.\" This is a wavelength of light, and it is the wavelength at which the EQE was observed. It is not a property name, but rather a property value.\n\nTo summarize, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"PCZDTB\" and \"EQE.\""
