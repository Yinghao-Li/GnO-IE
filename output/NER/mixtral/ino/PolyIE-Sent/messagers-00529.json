It is a type of polymer that consists of alternating units of quinacridone and benzothiadiazole.\n2. The second material name entity is \"quinacridone\", which is a planar compound that is introduced in the synthesis of PQCDTB.\n3. The third material name entity is \"benzothiadiazole\", which is another compound that is introduced in the synthesis of PQCDTB and is known for its high absorption properties.\n4. The fourth material name entity is \"Suzuki coupling reaction\", which is a chemical reaction used to synthesize PQCDTB. Although it is not a material itself, it is a crucial component of the synthesis process.\n\nTherefore, the material name entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Highly soluble poly[quinacridone-alt-benzothiadiazole]\n* quinacridone\n* benzothiadiazole\n* Suzuki coupling reaction."
