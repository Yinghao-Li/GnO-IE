The fourth material name entity is \"chloroform.\" It is a common solvent used in various applications.\n5. The fifth material name entity is \"o-dichlorobenzene.\" It is another solvent, often used in combination with chloroform in the given ratio.\n\nTherefore, the material name entities in the paragraph are: substrate, PDTP - DTDPP(Bu), PCBM (or PC 70 BM), chloroform, and o-dichlorobenzene."
