These could be words or phrases that describe a property or characteristic of something.\n2. In this paragraph, the possible \"Property Name\" entities are:\n* Absorption onset\n* Blue - shift\n* Higher TPD content\n3. Now, let's check if these entities refer to a property or characteristic of something in the context of the paragraph.\n4. Absorption onset refers to the wavelength at which a substance begins to absorb light, which is a property of the substance.\n5. Blue - shift refers to a shift of spectral lines toward shorter wavelengths, which is a property of the absorption spectrum.\n6. Higher TPD content refers to a higher concentration of tetraphenylporphyrin (TPD), which is a property of the material being studied.\n7. Therefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n* Absorption onset\n* Blue - shift\n* TPD content (Note: While TPD content is not explicitly labeled as \"higher\" in the entity, the context of the sentence makes it clear that it is being discussed as a property with a higher value.)"
