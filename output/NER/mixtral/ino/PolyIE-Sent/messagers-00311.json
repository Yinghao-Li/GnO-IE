Therefore, \"HOMO\" can be identified as a property name.\n3. \"ionization potential (IP)\" - Ionization potential is a property that describes the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom or molecule. Here, \"(IP)\" is used to specify the ionization potential, so \"ionization potential (IP)\" can be identified as a property name.\n4. \"electronegativity\" - Electronegativity is a property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons towards itself. Therefore, \"electronegativity\" can be identified as a property name.\n\nIn summary, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* lower-lying LUMO\n* HOMO\n* ionization potential (IP)\n* electronegativity"
