Now, let's evaluate each of these entities to determine if they are indeed \"Property Value\" entities:\n\t* \"difference of the dihedral angle\": This entity represents the difference in the dihedral angle between two structures, which is a measurable quantity and has a specific value associated with it. Therefore, it is a \"Property Value\" entity.\n\t* \"d 010\": This entity represents a specific distance or spacing between layers, which is a measurable quantity and has a specific value associated with it. Therefore, it is a \"Property Value\" entity.\n\t* \"more closely-packed lamellar structure\": This entity represents a structural characteristic of a material, which can be quantified in terms of the degree of packing or compactness. Therefore, it is a \"Property Value\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* The difference of the dihedral angle between PTATDPP and PTAFDPP\n* d 010\n* A more closely-packed lamellar structure formed by PTATDPP compared to PTAFDPP."
