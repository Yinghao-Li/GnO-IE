However, based on the information provided, it's clear that polymers are a material of interest in this paragraph.\n4. \"thin films\" - This is a state of matter, but in this context it is referring to a specific form of the polymers, so it could be considered a material.\n5. \"chlorobenzene solutions\" - This is a mixture of two materials, chlorobenzene and the polymers, but since the focus of the paragraph is on the polymers, I would not consider this a separate material name entity.\n\nTherefore, the material name entities in the paragraph are \"UV - vis absorption spectra\", \"chlorobenzene\", \"polymers\", and \"thin films\"."
