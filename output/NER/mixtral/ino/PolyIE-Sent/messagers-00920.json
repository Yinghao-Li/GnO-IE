It is a property of the thiophene units and the conjugated polymers."

It is an intrinsic property of a material that describes the energy required to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band.\n* π-electron system: Although it is a property of the thiophene units and the conjugated polymers, it is not a material property in the same sense as band gaps. It is more of a molecular property that describes the electronic structure of the material."
