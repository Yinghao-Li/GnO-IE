Here, it is described as \"efficient,\" which suggests that it is a desirable property.\n3. \"nanoscale fibril structure of PTATDPP\" - PTATDPP is a material, and here we are talking about its \"nanoscale fibril structure.\" A fibril structure refers to a type of arrangement of fibers or thread-like structures, and \"nanoscale\" suggests that these fibers are very small.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* FF (with the property value being high)\n* Charge-carrier mobility (with the property value being efficient)\n* Nanoscale fibril structure of PTATDPP (with the property value being the existence of such a structure)"
