It is a type of fullerene used as an electron transport layer in organic solar cells.\n\nPC71BM is short for [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester. It is a type of fullerene, which is a form of carbon that takes the shape of a soccer ball. Fullerenes are used in organic solar cells because they have excellent electron transport properties, which helps to improve the efficiency of the solar cell.\n\nIn the paragraph, the author is discussing the relationship between the weight fraction of PC71BM and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells. As the weight fraction of PC71BM is increased, the PCEs are gradually increased. This suggests that PC71BM plays an important role in the performance of organic solar cells."
