These could be words or phrases that refer to a specific property or characteristic of something.\n2. In this paragraph, the potential \"Property Name\" entities are:\n   - solid state\n   - red-shifted absorption spectra\n   - solution absorption\n   - aggregation of polymer main chain\n3. Now, let's evaluate each of these entities to determine if they are indeed \"Property Name\" entities.\n4. \"Solid state\" is a property of a material that refers to its solid form and lack of fluidity. Therefore, \"solid state\" is a \"Property Name\" entity.\n5. \"Red-shifted absorption spectra\" is a property of light that refers to the shift of the absorption spectrum towards longer wavelengths. Therefore, \"red-shifted absorption spectra\" is a \"Property Name\" entity.\n6. \"Solution absorption\" is a property of a material that refers to the amount of light absorbed by the material when it is in solution. Therefore, \"solution absorption\" is a \"Property Name\" entity.\n7. \"Aggregation of polymer main chain\" is a property of a polymer that refers to the clustering or grouping of the polymer chains. Therefore, \"aggregation of polymer main chain\" is a \"Property Name\" entity.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* solid state\n* red-shifted absorption spectra\n* solution absorption\n* aggregation of polymer main chain"

However, in this context, it is being used to describe the property of a polymer material, so we will keep \"red-shifted absorption spectra\" as it clearly refers to a material property.\n4. \"Solution absorption\" is a property of a material that refers to the amount of light absorbed by the material when it is in solution.
