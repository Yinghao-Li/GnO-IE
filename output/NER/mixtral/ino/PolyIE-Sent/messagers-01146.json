However, without a specific list of properties or their values, we cannot identify any concrete \"Property Value\" entities here.\n2. \"a higher absorption coefficient\" - This phrase refers to a specific property value for PC 70 BM compared to PCBM. The absorption coefficient is a measure of how well a material absorbs light at different wavelengths.\n3. \"in the visible region\" - This phrase describes a range of wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically the range that is visible to the human eye.
