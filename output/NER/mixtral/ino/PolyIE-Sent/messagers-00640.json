The second material name is \"polymer backbone.\" This refers to the main structure of a polymer, which can be made more rigid and coplanar by the presence of fused rings.\n3. The third material name is \"π-conjugation.\" This refers to the overlapping of p orbitals in a molecule, which can lead to the delocalization of electrons and the formation of a conjugated system.\n4. The fourth material name is \"bandgap.\" This refers to the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in a solid material. In this case, the bandgap is being lowered, which can increase the material's conductivity.\n5. The fifth and final material name is \"absorption.\" This refers to the process by which a material absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. In this case, the material's absorption is being extended, which can increase its sensitivity to light."
