Here, \"d-spacing\" refers to the distance between diffraction planes in a crystal lattice, and \"Å\" stands for Angstrom, a unit of length used to measure such distances. So, the material name is \"d-spacing\".\n2. The second material name is \"π-π stacking\". This refers to a type of interaction between aromatic rings or systems, where the rings are stacked face-to-face, with their π orbitals overlapping.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are \"d-spacing\" and \"π-π stacking\"."

The first mention of a property name is \"thermal annealing.\" However, this is a process or action being performed on a material, not a property of the material itself, so it does not qualify as a property name in this context.\n2. The next mention is \"the primary peak at 4.42 °.\" Here, the \"peak\" is a property of the material being analyzed. The value \"4.42 °\" is a measurement of this property, but the property itself is \"peak.\"\n3. Following this, we have \"a d-spacing of 19.99 Å.\" In this case, \"d-spacing\" is the property name, and \"19.99 Å\" is a measurement of this property.\n4. The next property name mentioned is \"π-π stacking.\" This refers to the arrangement of aromatic rings in a material, and is a property of the material's structure.\n5. Finally, we have \"the secondary broad peak at ∼ 21.1 °.\" Here, the \"peak\" is a property of the material being analyzed, and \"21.1 °\" is a measurement of this property.\n\nTherefore, the property names in this paragraph are \"peak,\" \"d-spacing,\" and \"π-π stacking.\""
