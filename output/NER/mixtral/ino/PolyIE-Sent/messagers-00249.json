In this context, it refers to the LUMO level of a specific type of polymer, which is a large molecule made up of repeating subunits.\n2. The second material name in the paragraph is \"alkyl chains.\" An alkyl chain is a type of chemical group consisting of a chain of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached to them. In this context, the alkyl chains are being described as substituted, which means that they are attached to the polymer as side groups.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are \"polymer LUMO level\" and \"alkyl chains.\""
