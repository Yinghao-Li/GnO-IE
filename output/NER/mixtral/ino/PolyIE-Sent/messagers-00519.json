A \"Property Value\" entity refers to a specific property or characteristic of an object or concept, often quantified or qualitatively described.\n3. In this paragraph, the potential \"Property Value\" entities are:\n\t* device performances\n\t* active layer morphology\n\t* surface morphology\n\t* PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films\n4. Now, let's analyze each entity to determine if it is indeed a \"Property Value\" entity.\n5. Device performances: This is a property of a device, often quantified through measurements such as efficiency, power, or speed.\n6. Active layer morphology: This is a property of the active layer in a device, often characterized through measurements such as surface roughness, domain size, or phase separation.\n7. Surface morphology: This is a property of the surface of an object, often characterized through measurements such as roughness, texture, or shape.\n8. PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films: This is a specific object or material being studied, and its properties are being investigated through AFM measurements.\n9. Based on this analysis, all four entities can be considered \"Property Value\" entities as they all refer to specific properties or characteristics of objects or concepts.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* device performances\n* active layer morphology\n* surface morphology\n* PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films"

      "content": "1. Based on the analysis in the previous answer, all four entities can be considered \"Property Value\" entities as they all refer to specific properties or characteristics of objects or concepts.\n2. However, to remove any potential ambiguity, we can further refine the list of entities to only include those that clearly refer to the value of a material property.\n3. Based on this criterion, the following entities can be considered as clearly referring to the value of a material property:\n\t* active layer morphology\n\t* surface morphology\n\t* PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films\n4. Device performances is a property of a device, but it is not a material property per se. Therefore, it is not included in the final list.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph that clearly refer to the value of a material property are:\n\n* active layer morphology\n* surface morphology\n* PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films"
