Therefore, \"PffBB-n\" is a \"Material Name\" entity.\n4. \"B3LYP\" is a type of exchange-correlation functional used in DFT calculations, but it is not a physical material. Therefore, \"B3LYP\" is not a \"Material Name\" entity.\n5. \"6-311+(d,p)\" is a basis set used in quantum chemistry calculations, but it is not a physical material. Therefore, \"6-311+(d,p)\" is not a \"Material Name\" entity.\n6. \"Vacuum\" is not a physical material, but a state of absence of matter. Therefore, \"vacuum\" is not a \"Material Name\" entity.\n7. \"Ethyl groups\" are a type of alkyl group with two carbon atoms and five hydrogen atoms. They are a material. Therefore, \"ethyl groups\" is a \"Material Name\" entity.\n\nIn summary, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"PffBB-n\" and \"ethyl groups\"."
