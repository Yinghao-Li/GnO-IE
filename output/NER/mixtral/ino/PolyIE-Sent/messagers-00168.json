A \"Property Name\" entity refers to a word or phrase that denotes a property or characteristic of something.\n\nFor example, in the sentence \"The color of the apple is red,\" \"color\" is a property name entity because it denotes a property or attribute (color) of the object (apple).\n\nIf you could provide a more complete paragraph, I would be happy to try and identify the \"Property Name\" entities for you."
