A \"Property Value\" entity is a specific value that is associated with a property or characteristic of an object or concept being described.\n3. In the given paragraph, the following values are mentioned in the context of certain properties:\n\t* 100\n\t* 2θ = 4.2 °\n\t* 21.0 Å\n\t* 19.4 °\n\t* 4.6 Å\n\t* 19.1 °\n\t* 4.7 Å\n4. Now, we need to determine the properties associated with these values.\n5. The values 100, 2θ = 4.2 °, and 21.0 Å are associated with the property \"diffraction peak\" and the interchain distance.\n6. The values 19.4 ° and 4.6 Å are associated with the property \"diffraction peak\" and the π-π stacking distance for PTATDPP.\n7. The values 19.1 ° and 4.7 Å are associated with the property \"diffraction peak\" and the π-π stacking distance for PTAFDPP.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* 100 (diffraction peak)\n* 2θ = 4.2 ° (diffraction peak)\n* 21.0 Å (interchain distance)\n* 19.4 ° (diffraction peak and π-π stacking distance for PTATDPP)\n* 4.6 Å (π-π stacking distance for PTATDPP)\n* 19.1 ° (diffraction peak and π-π stacking distance for PTAFDPP)\n* 4.7 Å (π-π stacking distance for PTAFDPP)"
