Now, let's analyze each of these entities to determine if they express a property or attribute of something:\n\t* comparatively rigid: This phrase expresses a property of the IDT and NT structures, indicating that they are relatively stiff or inflexible.\n\t* coplanar: This term indicates that the IDT and NT structures lie in the same plane, which is a property of their spatial arrangement.\n\t* polymer backbone: This phrase refers to the main structure of the polymer, which is a characteristic of the material.\n\t* solubility issue: This phrase suggests that there is a problem related to the ability of the IDT-NT based polymers to dissolve in solvents, which is a property of the material."
