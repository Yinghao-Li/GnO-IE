In this paragraph, the possible \"Property Name\" entities are:\n* wide absorption\n* visible light region\n* increased light harvesting\n3. Now, let's verify if these entities are indeed \"Property Name\" entities.\n* Wide absorption is a characteristic of a material that describes its ability to absorb light or other radiation over a broad range of wavelengths. Therefore, \"wide absorption\" is a \"Property Name\" entity.\n* The visible light region is a range of wavelengths that can be detected by the human eye. It is a property of light, not a material, but it is still a \"Property Name\" entity because it describes a characteristic of light.\n* Increased light harvesting is a desirable property of solar cells, which describes their ability to capture more light and convert it into electrical energy. Therefore, \"increased light harvesting\" is also a \"Property Name\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Wide absorption\n2. Visible light region\n3.
