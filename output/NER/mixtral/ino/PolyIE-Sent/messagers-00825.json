These entities are often related to physical or chemical characteristics of a substance or material.\n2. In the given paragraph, the following potential \"Property Name\" entities can be identified:\n\t* π-π* transitions\n\t* around 425 nm\n\t* large charge transfer features\n\t* between 500 and 700 nm\n\t* intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)\n\t* acceptor (BT/BO)\n\t* donor (NDT) units\n3. Now, let's verify if these entities are indeed \"Property Name\" entities by checking their definitions and context in which they are used.\n\t* π-π* transitions: This refers to a type of electronic transition that occurs in molecules, where an electron transitions from a π molecular orbital to a π* molecular orbital.\n\t* around 425 nm: This refers to the wavelength of light, which is a physical property of electromagnetic radiation.\n\t* large charge transfer features: This refers to the magnitude of charge transfer, which is a physical property of a material.\n\t* between 500 and 700 nm: This also refers to the wavelength of light, which is a physical property of electromagnetic radiation.\n\t* intramolecular charge transfer (ICT): This refers to a type of charge transfer that occurs within a single molecule, which is a physical property of a material.\n\t* acceptor (BT/BO) and donor (NDT) units: These refer to the chemical species that are involved in the charge transfer process, which is a physical property of a material.\n4. Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the following \"Property Name\" entities are present in the paragraph:\n\t* π-π* transitions\n\t* Wavelength (around 425 nm and between 500 and 700 nm)\n\t* Charge transfer features (large)\n\t* Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)\n\t* Acceptor (BT/BO) and donor (NDT) units."
