It is a white, odorless solid that is widely used as a pigment in paints, inks, and cosmetics, as well as a photocatalyst in various applications.\n\n2. Aluminum - The term \"aluminum\" also refers to a material, which is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13. It is a silvery-white, soft, non-magnetic, ductile metal. Aluminum is used in a huge variety of products including cans, foils, kitchen utensils, window frames, beer kegs, and airplane parts.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are \"TiO2\" and \"aluminum\"."
