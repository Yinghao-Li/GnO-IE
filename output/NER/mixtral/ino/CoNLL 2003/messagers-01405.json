Since the paragraph you provided is too short and lacks context to accurately identify any \"Organization\" entities, I will provide you with some examples of how I would identify \"Organization\" entities in a more detailed paragraph about plastic surgery in Brazil.\n\nExample 1:\n\nParagraph: The Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgery (SBCP) has reported a significant increase in the number of plastic surgery procedures performed in Brazil in the past year. The SBCP attributes this trend to a growing awareness of body image and an increasing acceptance of cosmetic procedures in Brazilian society.\n\nIn this paragraph, the \"Organization\" entities are:\n\n* Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgery (SBCP)\n\nExample 2:\n\nParagraph: According to a report by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS), Brazil is the second largest market for plastic surgery in the world, after the United States. The ISAPS report notes that Brazil has more plastic surgeons per capita than any other country, and that the most popular procedures in Brazil are breast augmentation, liposuction, and rhinoplasty.\n\nIn this paragraph, the \"Organization\" entities are:\n\n* International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS)\n\nExample 3:\n\nParagraph: In response to the growing demand for plastic surgery in Brazil, several hospitals and clinics have expanded their facilities and services. For example, the Hospital Samaritano in Rio de Janeiro has opened a new wing dedicated solely to plastic surgery, while the Ivo Pitanguy Plastic Surgery Institute in Rio de Janeiro has introduced new technologies and techniques to improve patient outcomes.\n\nIn this paragraph, the \"Organization\" entities are:\n\n* Hospital Samaritano\n* Ivo Pitanguy Plastic Surgery Institute"},
