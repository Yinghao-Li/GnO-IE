The first step in identifying location entities in a paragraph is to read through the text and underline or highlight any phrases that might indicate a location.\n2. In this paragraph, there are no explicit location names mentioned. However, we can infer that the execution of Mills likely took place in a prison or correctional facility, as the spokesman for the Department of Corrections is present.\n3. Therefore, the implied location entity in this paragraph is a \"prison\" or \"correctional facility.\"\n\nIt's important to note that the identification of location entities can sometimes be subjective and depend on the context of the text. In this case, the location entity is not explicitly stated, but can be inferred based on the presence of the Department of Corrections spokesman."},
