The first step in identifying location entities in a paragraph is to read through the text and underline or highlight any words or phrases that might refer to a location.\n2. In this paragraph, there are no explicit location entities mentioned. However, the phrase \"the capital\" could be referring to the capital city of the country where the uprising is taking place.\n3. Therefore, the location entity in this paragraph is \"the capital.\"\n\nIt's important to note that the context of the paragraph is crucial in identifying location entities. In this case, the paragraph is discussing a political uprising, so it's likely that \"the capital\" is referring to the capital city of the country where the uprising is taking place. However, without additional context, it's impossible to say for certain which country's capital is being referred to."},
