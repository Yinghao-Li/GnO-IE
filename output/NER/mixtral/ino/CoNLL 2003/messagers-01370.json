The first potential \"Person\" entity in the paragraph is \"residents.\" However, \"residents\" is a plural noun that refers to a group of people, so we need to consider if it is referring to a specific group of individuals who have been previously mentioned. In this case, \"residents\" is not a specific group, but a general term referring to people who live in the Kazanluk area. Therefore, \"residents\" can be considered a \"Person\" entity.\n2.
