The Sky Blues dominated the league, finishing 12 points ahead of their closest rivals, Liverpool. The Reds, who won the title in the previous season, had to settle for second place this time around. Manchester City's success was built on a solid defense, conceding only 26 goals in 38 matches, and a prolific attack, scoring 99 goals. The team's star players, such as Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden, and RÃºben Dias, played crucial roles in their triumph.\n\nLocation entities:\n\n* Manchester City (football club based in Manchester, England)\n* Manchester (city in England)\n* Liverpool (city in England)"},
