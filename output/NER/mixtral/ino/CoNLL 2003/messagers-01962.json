The technology giant's growth was driven by strong sales of the iPhone 13 and its services segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corporation reported quarterly revenue of $51.7 billion, a 22% increase year-over-year, thanks to its robust cloud business and growth in its gaming and personal computing divisions.\n\nMarkdown table:\n\n| Organization |\n| --- |\n| Apple Inc. |\n| App Store |\n| Apple Music |\n| iCloud |\n| Microsoft Corporation |\n| its cloud business |\n| gaming and personal computing divisions |\n\nIn this example, I have identified the organizations precisely as they appear in the paragraph. Please note that some organizations are mentioned multiple times, and some are included as part of a larger organization or description."}
