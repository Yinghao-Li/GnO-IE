She discussed the latest advancements in machine learning and how they are transforming various industries. After the lecture, I had the opportunity to speak with her and ask some questions about her research.\"\n\nIn this paragraph, the \"Person\" entities are \"Professor Jane Smith\" and \"her\" (referring to Professor Jane Smith). I removed \"artificial intelligence\" and \"machine learning\" as they are not \"Person\" entities, but rather concepts or fields of study. Similarly, I removed \"yesterday\" and \"various industries\" as they are temporal and abstract concepts, respectively."},
