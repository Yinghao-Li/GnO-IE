SQUASH: Although \"squash\" is typically a noun referring to a type of sport, in this context it seems to be used as an event or competition name, and not a person. Therefore, it is not a \"Person\" entity.\n2. EYLES: This is a proper noun referring to a person, specifically a squash player. Therefore, \"EYLES\" is a \"Person\" entity.\n3. FIFTH TITLE OF YEAR: This phrase does not refer to a specific person, but rather a title or achievement that a person (such as Eyles) can win. Therefore, it is not a \"Person\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the only \"Person\" entity in the paragraph is \"EYLES\"."},
