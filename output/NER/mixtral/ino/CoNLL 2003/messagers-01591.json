The first entity to consider is \"Lebanese authorities.\" While \"authorities\" refers to people and not a location, \"Lebanese\" is an adjective that describes their nationality and the country they come from. Therefore, \"Lebanese authorities\" can be identified as a location entity.\n2. The next entity is \"the trial.\" Since no specific location is mentioned, this entity does not refer to a location.\n3. \"February 16\" is a date and not a location.\n4. \"Lebanon\" is explicitly mentioned as the country of origin of the \"Lebanese authorities.\" Therefore, \"Lebanon\" is also a location entity.\n5. \"The Jewish state\" is a term used to refer to Israel. Therefore, \"the Jewish state\" can be identified as a location entity.\n\nIn summary, the location entities in the paragraph are \"Lebanese authorities\" and \"Lebanon,\" which both refer to the same location, and \"the Jewish state,\" which refers to Israel."},
