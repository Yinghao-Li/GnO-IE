The first step in identifying location entities in a paragraph is to read through the text and underline or highlight any words or phrases that might refer to a place.\n2. In this paragraph, the following words and phrases could potentially refer to locations: \"Langmore,\" \"parliament,\" \"Australia,\" \"United Nations headquarters,\" and \"New York.\"\n3. However, \"Langmore\" is a proper noun referring to an individual, not a location.\n4. \"Parliament\" is a general term that can refer to a legislative body in any country, so it is not a specific location.\n5. \"Australia\" and \"New York\" are both proper nouns that refer to specific locations.\n6. \"United Nations headquarters\" is a specific location, but it is not identified by a proper noun.\n7. Therefore, the location entities in this paragraph are \"Australia\" and \"United Nations headquarters in New York.\""},
