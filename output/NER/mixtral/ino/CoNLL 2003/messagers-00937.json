Warsaw - This is a person entity if we are referring to the former Polish Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, who served as the Mayor of Warsaw before becoming Prime Minister. However, in this context, it is more likely referring to the city of Warsaw, so it is not a person entity.\n5. Switzerland - This is a person entity, as it refers to a country.\n6.
