The paragraph does not provide first names for the heads of state of Gabon, Mali, and Chad, but we can still identify them as person entities based on their roles. So, \"the heads of state of Gabon\" is a person entity, \"Mali\" is a country entity, and \"Chad\" is also a country entity. Therefore, the person entity here is the head of state of Gabon.\n4.
