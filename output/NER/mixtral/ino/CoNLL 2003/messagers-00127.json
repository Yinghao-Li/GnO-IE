For example, the following sentences contain clear references to organizations:\n\n* \"I work for Microsoft, which is a technology company based in Redmond, Washington.\"\n* \"The American Red Cross is a humanitarian organization that provides emergency assistance and disaster relief.\"\n\nIn these sentences, \"Microsoft\" and \"the American Red Cross\" are clear references to specific organizations.\n\nIf you have a different paragraph that you would like me to analyze, please let me know!
