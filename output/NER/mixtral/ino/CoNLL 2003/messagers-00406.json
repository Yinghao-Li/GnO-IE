They started their journey in San Francisco and drove through Los Angeles, where they stopped for a day to visit the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame. After spending some time in LA, they continued their drive through the scenic Route 66, passing by the Petrified Forest National Park and the Painted Desert. They finally arrived at the Grand Canyon, where they spent a few days exploring the breathtaking views and hiking the trails.\n\nAfter the Grand Canyon, they drove towards Yellowstone National Park, stopping at the historic town of Durango, Colorado, to take a break and enjoy a delicious meal. They also passed through Salt Lake City, Utah, before reaching their next destination. At Yellowstone, they marveled at the geysers, hot springs, and diverse wildlife.\n\nFinally, they headed to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. Along the way, they drove through the Badlands National Park, admiring the unique landscape and rock formations. After visiting Mount Rushmore, they began their journey back home to San Francisco, taking a different route through Denver, Colorado, and Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n---\n\nLocation entities:\n\n1.
