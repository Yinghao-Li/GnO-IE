In this paragraph, the following proper nouns are mentioned:\n   - Lebanese\n   - Israel\n   - commander\n3. We can infer that \"Lebanese\" refers to the people or government of Lebanon, which is not a specific person.\n4. Similarly, \"Israel\" refers to the country of Israel, not a specific person.\n5. However, the term \"commander\" is a title that is often associated with a specific person.\n6. In this case, the paragraph mentions that the commander is the commander of Israel's surrogate militia in south Lebanon.\n7. While the specific name of the commander is not mentioned, we can infer that the commander is a specific person who holds the position of leading Israel's surrogate militia in south Lebanon.\n8. Therefore, the \"Person\" entity in this paragraph is the commander of Israel's surrogate militia in south Lebanon."},
