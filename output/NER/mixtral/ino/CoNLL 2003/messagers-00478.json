Instead, I can give you an example of how I would identify and remove irrelevant entities and only keep the ones that clearly refer to an organization.\n\nParagraph:\n\nJohn Smith works at Microsoft, which is a multinational technology company. He is a software engineer and has been working there for five years. Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. It is headquartered in Redmond, Washington.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* \"John Smith\" is a person, not an organization.\n* \"Microsoft\" is a multinational technology company, which is an organization.\n* \"software engineer\" is a job title, not an organization.\n* \"Bill Gates\" and \"Paul Allen\" are people, not organizations.\n* \"1975\" is a year, not an organization.\n* \"Redmond, Washington\" is a location, not an organization.\n\nTherefore, the only organization entity in this paragraph is \"Microsoft\"."},
