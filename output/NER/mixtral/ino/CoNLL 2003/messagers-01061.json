Analyze the context of each entity to determine if it refers to a \"Location.\"\n\nEntities:\n\n* Gorst\n* Major\n* House of Commons\n* 651-seat\n* lower house of parliament\n\nAnalysis:\n\n* Gorst: This is a proper noun and likely refers to a person, not a location.\n* Major: This is a common noun and likely refers to a person, not a location.\n* House of Commons: This is a proper noun and refers to a legislative chamber in the United Kingdom, which could be considered a location.\n* 651-seat: This is a numerical value and a unit of measurement, not a location.\n* lower house of parliament: This is a common noun and refers to a type of legislative chamber, not a specific location.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe only potential \"Location\" entity in the paragraph is \"House of Commons.\" However, it's important to note that \"House of Commons\" is not a physical location but rather a legislative chamber. Therefore, it may not be what the user is looking for when asking for \"Location\" entities. Nonetheless, based on the given prompt, \"House of Commons\" can be identified as the \"Location\" entity in the paragraph."},
