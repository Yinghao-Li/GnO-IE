An \"offering\" typically refers to an organized effort or process by which something is presented or made available to the public, often in the context of finance and business.\n3. In this case, the \"offering\" is a financial transaction, where $475 million is being made available to investors in the form of a tax-exempt security.\n4. Therefore, the \"Organization\" entity in this paragraph is the issuer of the tax-exempt offering, which could be a government entity, a non-profit organization, or any other entity that is eligible for tax-exempt status.\n\nWithout more context, it is difficult to identify the specific organization responsible for the offering. However, the paragraph clearly indicates that an organization is involved in issuing the tax-exempt offering as part of the refunding plan."},
