For example, if you give me the following paragraph:\n\n\"John Smith, the CEO of XYZ Corporation, announced the company's quarterly earnings today. The company reported a profit of $10 million, up from $8 million in the same quarter last year. XYZ's stock price rose 5% on the news.\"\n\nI would remove the irrelevant entities and identify the \"Person\" entities as follows:\n\nPerson entities: John Smith"},
