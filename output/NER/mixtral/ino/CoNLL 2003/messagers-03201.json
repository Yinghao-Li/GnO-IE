The technology giant's success was driven by strong sales of the iPhone 13 and its services segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud.\n\nMarkdown table:\n\n| Organization |\n| --- |\n| Apple Inc. |\n| Exxon Mobil Corporation |\n\nIn this example, I have identified two organizations: Apple Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corporation.
