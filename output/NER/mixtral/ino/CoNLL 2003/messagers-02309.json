It was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The company's main products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, the AirPods wireless earbuds, and the HomePod smart speaker.\"\n\nThen, the organization entities in this paragraph are:\n\n* Apple Inc.\n* Cupertino (as a location of Apple Inc.'s headquarters)\n* The United States (implied as the country where Apple Inc. is headquartered)\n* The group of people who founded Apple Inc.: Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.\n\nNote that the other proper nouns in the paragraph, such as \"California,\" \"1976,\" \"iPhone,\" \"iPad,\" \"Mac,\" \"iPod,\" \"Apple Watch,\" \"Apple TV,\" \"AirPods,\" and \"HomePod\" do not refer to organizations and are not organization entities."},

Also, the founders of Apple Inc. are included as organization entities, as they played a significant role in the formation and early history of the company."}
