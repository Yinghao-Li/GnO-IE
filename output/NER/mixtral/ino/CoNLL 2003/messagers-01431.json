It was founded in 1911 and is one of the largest and most profitable technology companies in the world. IBM is involved in a wide range of activities, including the development and manufacturing of computer hardware and software, providing consulting and IT services, and conducting research and development in areas such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and quantum computing.\"\n\nIn this paragraph, \"IBM\" and \"United States\" are both \"Organization\" entities. \"United States\" is an organization in the sense that it is a political entity made up of a group of people who have combined their efforts to achieve common goals."},
