China: Although China is a country and not a person, it is sometimes referred to as a \"person\" entity in a figurative sense, especially in the context of international relations. However, in this particular paragraph, China is not being referred to as a \"person\" entity.\n2. The State Council or cabinet: The State Council is the chief administrative authority of the People's Republic of China, and it is composed of various government ministers and the premier. It is not a \"person\" entity, but rather a collective body.\n3. Hainan: Hainan is a province of China, and therefore it is not a \"person\" entity.\n4. Xinhua news agency: Xinhua is the official state-run press agency of the People's Republic of China, and it is not a \"person\" entity.\n\nBased on the above analysis, there are no \"Person\" entities in the given paragraph."},
