If you could give me a paragraph that includes information about specific locations, I would be happy to identify those entities for you.\n\nIn general, a location entity is a specific place, such as a city, country, or stadium. For example, in the following sentence: \"The New England Patriots will play the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia,\" the location entities are \"New England,\" \"Los Angeles,\" \"Super Bowl LIII,\" \"Mercedes-Benz Stadium,\" and \"Atlanta, Georgia.\""},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is an example of how the location entities from the sentence I provided earlier could be presented in a Markdown table:\n\n| Location |\n| --- |\n| New England |\n| Los Angeles |\n| Super Bowl LIII |\n| Mercedes-Benz Stadium |\n| Atlanta, Georgia |\n\nNote that the location entities are presented exactly as they appear in the original sentence, with no additional words or punctuation added. This is important because even small changes in the way an entity is presented can affect its meaning or make it unclear what the entity refers to. For example, changing \"Atlanta, Georgia\" to \"Georgia\" would not be a valid entity because it is not specific enough. Similarly, changing \"Super Bowl LIII\" to \"Super Bowl\" would not be a valid entity because it is too vague and could refer to any Super Bowl, not just the specific one being referred to in the sentence."}
