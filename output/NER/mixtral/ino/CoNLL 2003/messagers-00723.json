He wants to visit the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and Times Square while he is there.\"\n\nI would be able to identify the following \"Location\" entities:\n\n| Location |\n| --- |\n| New York City |\n| Statue of Liberty |\n| Central Park |\n| Times Square |\n\nI hope this helps clarify my capabilities.
