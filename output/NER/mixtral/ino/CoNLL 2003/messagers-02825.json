Without further context, it's difficult to say for sure whether this is a location entity. However, in the context of a sports match, it's likely that \"London Irish\" refers to a sports team, and the location of the team is London. Therefore, \"London\" can be considered a location entity.\n\nSo, in summary, the location entities in the paragraph are \"Gloucester\" and \"London\"."},
