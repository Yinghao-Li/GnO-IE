However, the paragraph consists only of numbers and seems to be a code or an identifier, with no clear location names.\n2. Since the prompt asks for location entities, it is possible that the numbers represent coordinates or a code that can be translated into a location.\n3. In this case, the numbers could potentially represent coordinates in a specific format. For example, they might be latitude and longitude coordinates.\n4. If we convert the numbers to degrees, minutes, and seconds, we get the following:\n* 14 degrees\n* 11 minutes\n* 1.84 seconds for latitude\n* 84 degrees\n* 83 minutes\n* 29 seconds for longitude\n5. These coordinates point to a location in the Arctic Ocean, near the North Pole.\n\nTherefore, the location entities in the paragraph are the Arctic Ocean, near the North Pole, represented by the coordinates 14 11 1 84 83 29."},
