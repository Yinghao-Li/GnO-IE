The first \"Person\" entity in the paragraph is \"Leeds United defender.\" However, this phrase refers to a position and not a specific person, so it doesn't meet the criteria for a person entity.\n2. The next person entity is \"he.\" While \"he\" is a reference to a person, it is not clear who \"he\" refers to until later in the sentence.\n3. The paragraph mentions \"his younger brother, Bobby.\" Here, \"his\" refers to the same person as the earlier pronoun \"he,\" and \"Bobby\" is a name, so both \"he\" and \"Bobby\" are person entities.\n4. However, the original question asks for the person entities in the paragraph, not just in the sentence. In the context of the entire paragraph, the person entities are:\n   - The lanky former Leeds United defender (who is not named in the paragraph)\n   - Bobby (the younger brother of the lanky former Leeds United defender)\n\nTherefore, the person entities in the paragraph are \"the lanky former Leeds United defender\" and \"Bobby.\""},
