Identify all the entities in the paragraph using Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques.\n2. Manually review each entity and determine if it refers to an organization.\n3. Remove any entities that do not clearly refer to an organization.\n\nFor example, if the paragraph contained the following sentence:\n\n\"Yesterday, the National Football League (NFL) announced its new partnership with Amazon, which will stream Thursday Night Football games exclusively on Prime Video.\"\n\nThe entities identified would be:\n\n* Yesterday (not an organization)\n* National Football League (NFL) (organization)\n* Amazon (organization)\n* Prime Video (not an organization)\n\nAfter removing the irrelevant entities, the final list would be:\n\n* National Football League (NFL)\n* Amazon"},
