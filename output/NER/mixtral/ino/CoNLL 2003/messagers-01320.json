Therefore, we cannot identify any individual or person as an \"Organization\" entity in this paragraph.\n2. However, the paragraph does mention \"Norilsk\" as an entity.\n3. Based on the context, \"Norilsk\" appears to be a proper noun referring to a specific entity, rather than a common noun.\n4. After conducting some research, it appears that \"Norilsk\" is a city in Russia, as well as the name of a large mining company called \"MMC Norilsk Nickel\" that is headquartered in that city.\n5. Given that the paragraph discusses salary arrears and worker strikes in relation to \"Norilsk,\" it seems likely that the entity being referred to is the mining company rather than the city.\n6. Therefore, the \"Organization\" entity in this paragraph is \"MMC Norilsk Nickel\" or simply \"Norilsk.\""},
