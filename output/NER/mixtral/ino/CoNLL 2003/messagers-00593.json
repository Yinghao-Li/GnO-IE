If you could give me a paragraph with specific details about the locations where soccer matches are being played, I would be happy to help you identify those entities.\n\nIn general, location entities refer to specific places or geographic features, such as countries, cities, states, provinces, neighborhoods, buildings, or landmarks. These entities can be identified by their proper names, descriptive phrases, or other identifying features.\n\nFor example, in the following paragraph, the location entities are in bold:\n\n\"The Manchester United vs. Chelsea soccer match will be played at Old Trafford stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday at 3 pm.\"\n\nIn this case, the location entities are \"Old Trafford stadium,\" \"Manchester,\" and \"England.\""},

The table format is a common way to present entities in a clear and organized manner, with each entity occupying a separate row and a single column for the entity type."}
