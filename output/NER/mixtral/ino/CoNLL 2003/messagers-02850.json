In order to remove irrelevant entities and only keep the entities that clearly refer to a location, I would need a paragraph that contains various types of entities.\n\nOnce I have a paragraph, I can use natural language processing techniques to identify and extract the entities that refer to a location. This would involve looking for words or phrases that match common patterns associated with location names, such as geographical features, political divisions, or specific places.\n\nFor example, in the sentence \"She visited the Statue of Liberty in New York City last summer,\" the location entities are \"Statue of Liberty\" and \"New York City.\" The phrase \"last summer\" is not a location entity because it refers to a time period rather than a specific place.\n\nTherefore, if you could provide a paragraph that contains various types of entities, I would be happy to remove the irrelevant entities and only keep the ones that clearly refer to a location."},
