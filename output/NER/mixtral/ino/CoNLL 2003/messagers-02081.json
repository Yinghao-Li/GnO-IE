A location refers to a place, physical or virtual, where events or actions occur.\n2. In the given paragraph, there are no explicit physical location entities mentioned. However, there are references to virtual locations.\n3. The first virtual location entity is \"the Internet\" which is implied in the phrase \"Internet companies.\"\n4. The second virtual location entity is \"online works\" which refers to digital content or information available on the Internet.\n5. The third virtual location entity is \"online information\" which refers to data or knowledge that can be accessed via the Internet.\n6. Two specific examples of online information are also mentioned: \"soccer results\" and \"stock prices.\"\n\nTherefore, the \"Location\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* The Internet\n* Online works\n* Online information (which includes soccer results and stock prices)"},
