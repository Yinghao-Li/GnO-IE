The first entity to consider is \"Indian officials.\" While not a location in the traditional sense, it does refer to the government of India, which is headquartered in New Delhi.

Bombay is a former name of the city now known as Mumbai, which is located in the state of Maharashtra in western India.\n3. The paragraph also mentions that the bombings occurred \"three months later\" after an unspecified event. While this phrase does not refer to a specific location, it does provide temporal context for the events described in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the only relevant \"Location\" entity in the paragraph is \"Bombay\" (now Mumbai), which is mentioned as the site of the bombings."},
