The first mention of a \"group\" could be considered a person entity, but it is more likely that the passage is referring to a group of people, rather than a specific person.\n2. The passage then mentions \"13 nuns\" - this is a group of people, but each nun can be considered an individual person entity.\n3. The passage specifies that seven of the nuns are \"Italians\" and six are \"Zaireans\" - these are also person entities.\n4. The passage then mentions \"four priests\" - this is another group of people, and each priest can be considered an individual person entity.\n5. The passage specifies that two of the priests are \"from Belgium\", one is \"from Spain\", and one is \"from Zambia\" - these are also person entities.\n\nIn summary, the person entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* 13 nuns\n* Seven Italians\n* Six Zaireans\n* Four priests\n* Two Belgians\n* One Spaniard\n* One Zambian\n\nNote that some of these entities are groups of people, while others are individuals.
