In order to identify the \"Person\" entities in a paragraph, I need to see the full context of the text.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a general explanation of how to identify \"Person\" entities. To do this, look for proper nouns or noun phrases that refer to specific individuals or groups of people. For example, in the sentence \"John Smith won the match,\" \"John Smith\" is a \"Person\" entity because it is a proper noun that refers to a specific individual. Similarly, in the sentence \"The New York Yankees won the World Series,\" \"The New York Yankees\" is a \"Person\" entity because it is a proper noun that refers to a specific sports team.\n\nWithout a complete paragraph, I cannot provide you with specific examples of \"Person\" entities.

In order to provide you with a table of \"Person\" entities, I need to see the full context of the text.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a general explanation of how to create a Markdown table of \"Person\" entities.

He is a talented tennis player. The New York Yankees won the World Series. They are a popular baseball team.\"\n\nThe Markdown table of \"Person\" entities would look like this:\n\n| Person |\n| --- |\n| John Smith |\n| The New York Yankees |\n\nWithout a complete paragraph, I cannot provide you with a specific table of \"Person\" entities.
