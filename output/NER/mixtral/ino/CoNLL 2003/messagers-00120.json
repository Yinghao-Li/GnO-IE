The string \"C. Cairns\" could potentially be a name of a person or place, but without further context, it is difficult to definitively classify it as a location. Similarly, \"b\" could be a variable or abbreviation, but it is not clear where it is located or what it refers to. \"Saqlain\" is likely a name, but again, it is not clear whether it refers to a person or a place. \"10\" could be a number of any kind, including a year, a quantity, or a score, but it does not provide any information about a location.\n\nTherefore, based on the given paragraph, I am unable to identify any clear \"Location\" entities."},
