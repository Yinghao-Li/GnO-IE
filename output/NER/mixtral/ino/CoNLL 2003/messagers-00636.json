He is a software engineer in the search division, which is part of the larger Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. John's team is responsible for developing and improving Google's search algorithms to provide the best possible results to users.

Please provide a complete and correct paragraph so I can help you identify the Organization entities in it."},

This table format can be useful for organizing and reviewing the entities in a clear and concise way."}
