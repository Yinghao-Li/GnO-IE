Mexico is mentioned in relation to trade, indicating that Mexico is being used as a location where trade begins.\n\nTherefore, the \"Location\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* United States (U.S.)\n* Mexico"},

The first possible \"Organization\" entity in the paragraph is \"Greenspan.\" However, without additional context, it is unclear whether \"Greenspan\" refers to an individual or an organization. Based on the context provided, it seems more likely that \"Greenspan\" refers to Alan Greenspan, who was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States from 1987 to 2006. Therefore, \"Greenspan\" is not an \"Organization\" entity in this paragraph.\n2. The next possible \"Organization\" entity is the \"Federal Reserve of the United States.\" However, this entity is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph.\n3. The paragraph mentions \"Mexican stocks,\" but \"stocks\" are not an \"Organization\" entity.\n4. The paragraph also mentions \"U.S. long bond rates,\" but \"rates\" are not an \"Organization\" entity.\n5.
