The keynote speaker was Dr. Jane Smith, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest healthcare companies in the world. After the meeting, I had lunch with some colleagues from the World Health Organization (WHO), where we discussed potential collaborations on global health initiatives.\n\nIn this paragraph, the \"Organization\" entities are:\n\n* American Medical Association (AMA)\n* UnitedHealth Group\n* World Health Organization (WHO)\n\nThese entities are groups of people that have a particular purpose, such as a business, agency, or institution."},
