It was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. Today, Apple is one of the world's largest technology companies, with products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computer.

I would remove irrelevant entities such as \"American\", \"multinational\", \"technology\", \"1976\", and \"today\" because they do not clearly refer to organizations."},

It was established on April 7, 1948, and is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The WHO's mission is to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. It is governed by 194 member states through the World Health Assembly.\"\n\nAnd here is the corresponding table with the valid organization entities:\n\n| Organization |\n| --- |\n| The World Health Organization (WHO) |\n| United Nations |\n| World Health Assembly |\n\nNote that \"April 7, 1948\" and \"Geneva, Switzerland\" are not included as organization entities because they do not clearly refer to organizations."}
