Next, we need to determine which of these nouns refer to people or groups of people. This can be determined by context.\n3. In this paragraph, the noun \"supporters\" clearly refers to a group of people, as it is a term that is commonly used to describe people who advocate for a particular cause or policy.\n4. The other nouns in the paragraph do not refer to people or groups of people. \"Pacts\" refers to agreements between countries, \"intellectual property rights\" refers to legal protections for creative works, and \"Berne Convention\" refers to an international agreement on copyright.\n5.
