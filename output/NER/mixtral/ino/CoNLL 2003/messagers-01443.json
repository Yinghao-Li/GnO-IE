The first step in identifying \"Person\" entities in a text is to determine which nouns or pronouns in the text refer to individual people or groups of people.\n2. In this paragraph, there are no explicit mentions of individual people or groups of people.\n3. However, the paragraph does mention \"Tampico port authorities,\" which refers to a group of people who are responsible for managing the port of Tampico.\n4. Therefore, the \"Person\" entity in this paragraph is \"Tampico port authorities.\"\n5. It's worth noting that the name of the ship \"Kenda\" might be a person's name, but without further context, it's impossible to determine for sure. Therefore, I would not include \"Kenda\" as a \"Person\" entity in this case."},
