Analyze each entity to determine if it is an \"Organization.\"\n\nEntities in the paragraph:\n\n* Police\n* guards\n\nTo determine if any of these entities is an \"Organization,\" let's consider the following criteria:\n\n* A group of people that work together to achieve a common goal or purpose.\n* Often have a formal/official structure and hierarchy.\n* May have a unique name, symbol, or logo.\n\nApplying these criteria to the entities in the paragraph:\n\n* Police: This is an organization as it meets all the criteria. It is a group of people who work together to maintain law and order, has a formal structure and hierarchy, and often has a unique name, symbol, or logo.\n* Guards: While this term can refer to individuals or a group of people responsible for protecting a place or person, it is not clear from the paragraph if the guards are part of a larger organization. Therefore, we cannot definitively say if \"guards\" is an organization in this context.\n\nTherefore, the only identified \"Organization\" entity in the paragraph is the \"Police.\""},
