However, in this paragraph, there are no individual people mentioned.\n2. Next, we can look for proper nouns that refer to organizations or groups, as these can sometimes be considered \"Person\" entities in a broader sense.\n3. In this paragraph, the proper nouns that refer to organizations or groups are \"Dutch supermarkets group Ahold NV\" and \"BILO food discount stores.\"\n4. While \"Dutch supermarkets group Ahold NV\" is not a person, it is a group of people working together as an organization. Therefore, we could consider it a \"Person\" entity in a broader sense.\n5. However, \"BILO food discount stores\" is not a person or a group of people, but rather a chain of stores. Therefore, it is not a \"Person\" entity.\n6. Based on this analysis, the only \"Person\" entity in the paragraph is \"Dutch supermarkets group Ahold NV.\""},
