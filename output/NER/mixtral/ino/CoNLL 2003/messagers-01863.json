However, the paragraph also mentions \"the fiery politician,\" but this is not a proper noun, so it is not a \"Person\" entity on its own.\n4. But, since the context of the paragraph makes it clear that this phrase refers to a specific person, we can infer that it is also a \"Person\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Person\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Sophia Loren\n* AN leaders\n* The fiery politician (although not a proper noun, it refers to a specific person in the context of the paragraph)"},
