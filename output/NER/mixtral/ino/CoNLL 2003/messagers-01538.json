The first organization mentioned is \"trade union.\" A trade union, also known as a labor union, is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety and health conditions, and attaining better wages, benefits (such as vacation, health care, and retirement), and working conditions through collective bargaining.\n2. The second organization mentioned is the \"WTO,\" or World Trade Organization. The WTO is an intergovernmental organization that regulates international trade. It was established in 1995, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that had been in place since 1948.
