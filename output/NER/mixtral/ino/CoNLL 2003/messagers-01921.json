Italian: In this context, \"Italian\" refers to Italian BTPs (Buoni del Tesoro Poliennali), which are medium and long-term Italian government bonds. Since the term is used to describe a bond issued by a specific country, it can be considered a location entity.\n2. Sweden: In this context, \"Sweden\" refers to the country, and the return rate mentioned is related to a financial instrument (bonds or treasury bills) issued by the Swedish government. Therefore, \"Sweden\" can also be considered a location entity.\n\nSo, the location entities in the paragraph are \"Italian\" and \"Sweden.\""},
