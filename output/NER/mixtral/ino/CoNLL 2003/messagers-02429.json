Since the paragraph you provided does not contain any clear location entities, I cannot provide you with a list of location entities to remove.\n\nTo clarify, a location entity is a word or phrase that refers to a specific place or location, such as a city, country, or landmark. In order for a word or phrase to be considered a location entity, it should be clear from the context that it refers to a specific place.\n\nFor example, in the following paragraph, the location entities are in bold:\n\n\"Yesterday, I visited the **Eiffel Tower** in **Paris**, France. I had a great time exploring the city and taking in the sights.\"\n\nIn this case, \"Eiffel Tower\" and \"Paris\" are both location entities because they refer to specific places. \"France\" is also a location entity because it provides additional context about the location of \"Paris.\"\n\nIf you could provide a paragraph with clear location entities, I would be happy to help you remove any irrelevant entities and identify the ones that refer to specific locations."},
