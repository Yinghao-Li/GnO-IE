This move is expected to create over 1,000 jobs in the region.\n\nIn this paragraph, the organizations are:\n\n1. Amazon\n2. The government of Raleigh, North Carolina (implied)\n\nThese entities are organizations because they are structured entities that engage in specific activities and have a distinct identity. Amazon is a well-known e-commerce company, and the government of Raleigh, North Carolina is a political entity that governs the city of Raleigh."},
