In order to develop high - performance side - chain D-A conjugated polymers , it is necessary to develop new catalog of side - chain D-A polymers for efficient PSCs. Given that benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) unit has a large planar molecular structure by fusing a benzene with two flanking thiophenyl units and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) , i.e. , pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione unit has a well conjugated structure with strong π-π interaction and electron - withdrawing effect , some main - chain D-A copolymers based on DPP or / and BDT units as prime building block had been designed for optoelectronic applications in both thin - film transistors and solar cells in recent years. 6 It is worthy to note that PSCs based on these copolymers with a tandem structure showed an increasing PCE of 8.62% . 2a Here we report another novel sidechain D-A conjugated copolymer ( PBDT-TDPP-S ) for highperformance PSCs , in which the BDT and thiophene units are conjugatedly formed the main chain and the di(thiophen-2yl)pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione ( TDPP ) units are pended onto the thiophenyl units to build the side chain by a linkage of a 2-vinylthiophenyl unit. Using PBDT-TDPP-S as electron donor and PC71BM as electron acceptor , the resulting PSCs exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a PCE of 4.89% , an open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.84 V , a shortcircuit current ( J SC ) of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 56.0% . To our best knowledge , the efficiency is among the highest reported to date for side - chain D-A conjugated copolymers and is twice higher than that of the main - chain D-A counterpart polymer PBDTDPP-OR in the single BHJ PSCs. synthesized by a common Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as catalyst with a high yield of 78.7% , as shown in Scheme 1. For comparison , the corresponding main - chain D-A conjugated copolymer of PBDT - DPP was made at the same time. The resulting PBDT-TDPP-S showed good solubility in common organic solvents , such as chlorobenzene , o-dichlorobenzene , and dichloromethane ( DCM ) , but PBDT - DPP was nearly not soluble in them. Gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis showed that PBDT-TDPP-S has a numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) of 1.34 × 10^4 g mol^-1 with a polydispersity index of 1.27 ( Figure S1 ). Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) indicated that PBDT-TDPP-S has high thermal stability with a degradation temperature ( T d ) of 364 °C at 5% weight loss. The corresponding molecular weights and thermal properties of PBDT-TDPP-S are summarized in Table 1 , and the recorded TGA curve is shown in Figure S2 ( see Supporting Information ) .
