This level of thermal stability is adequate for applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices. Optical Properties. The absorption spectrum of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) in film is shown in Figure 2 together with that of P3HT and normalized AM 1.5G photon flux for comparison. The polymer has a broad absorption band in the range of 500-1100 nm with a tail extending to 1.3 μm. The full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) film is 324 nm , which is nearly a double that of P3HT film ( 158 nm ). The optical band gap of the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) film is 1.13 eV , as estimated from the absorption onset ( 1100 nm ). All these data indicate that PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) can utilize a larger fraction of solar light that P3HT as a possible material for applications in micrometer response photovoltaic devices. Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was performed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of PDTP-DTDPP-(Bu ). The CV curves were recorded referenced to an Ag / Ag þ electrode , which was calibrated against the ferroceneferrocenium ( Fc / Fc þ ) redox couple ( 4.8 eV below the vacuum level ) ; the CV curves are shown in Figure 3. On the basis of the onset values of oxidation ( 0.10 V ) and reduction potential ( -1.17 V ) of the polymer , the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer were calculated as -4.90 and -3.63 eV , respectively. The electrochemical band gap thus determined is about 1.27 eV , which is slightly higher than the optical band gap. X-ray Diffraction ( XRD ) Measurements. The XRD patterns of the bulk samples of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH) were recorded to understand their structures in the solid state. As shown in Figure 4 , both samples show diffraction peaks at low angles , which could be attributed to a lamellar structure. The d-spacings of the diffraction from ( 100 ) are 14.8 and 14.9 Å for PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH) , respectively. The peaks around 24 ° for both polymers can be assigned to the face - to - face distance of the aromatic groups in the polymer chains arranged in the parallel direction. This π-π stacking distance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) was 3.64 Å , slightly lower than that of PDTP - DTDPP(EH) ( 3.74 Å ) , which suggests that the butyl group in DPP segment is better for the close π-π stacking of the polymer backbones compared to the bulkier 2-ethylhexyl group.
