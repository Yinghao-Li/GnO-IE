The best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.33% was obtained from PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 with [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) due to the improved light absorption and thus a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) higher than 16 mA / cm^2.

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. The paragraph mentions the synthesis of a new series of conjugated random terpolymers (PBDTT-DPP-TPD) with different ratios of three units: BDTT, DPP, and TPD. However, the specific values of the ratios are not provided in the text.\n2. An increase in TPD content results in increased absorption between 400 and 650 nm and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level.\n3. Higher DPP contents result in stronger absorption between 600 and 900 nm.\n4. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.33% was obtained from PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 with PC71BM.\n5. The PCE values showed nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6%.\n6. Density functional theory calculations showed that small portions of strong electron-withdrawing DPP in PBDTT-DPP25-TPD75 and PBDTT-DPP10-TPD90 could provide trap sites.\n7. The polymer packing and nanomorphology were investigated by grazing-incidence X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy.\n8. Low-band-gap polymers for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)-type polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been studied intensively with the aim of matching a greater part of the solar spectrum and thus harvesting more photon flux, to produce efficiencies greater than 7-9%.\n9. Most low-band-gap polymers achieved by the donor-acceptor (D-A) approach do not show broad absorption, but instead the absorption maxima are redshifted, decreasing the number of absorbed photons in the visible region and ultimately limiting the achievable photocurrent.\n10. One promising approach toward broadening the absorption of the solar spectrum is to develop random terpolymers based on the copolymerization of two different electron-rich units and one electron-deficient unit or one electron-rich unit and two different electron-deficient units.\n11. The judicious selection of two different electron-deficient or -rich groups with different electron-withdrawing or -donating strengths is critical to achieve complementary and broad visible light absorption, thus maximizing photon harvesting.\n\nBased on the paragraph, the identified material properties with their corresponding values and units are:\n\n1.
