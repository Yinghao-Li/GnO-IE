This approach has provided a remarkable short - circuit current density ( J SC ) of 16 mA / cm^2 , 3 whereas , in general , the V OC has suffered 4 because of a higher than the HOMO optimal energy level in order to pursue a lower bandgap. In the PSCs community , poly(2,7-carbazole-altdithienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDTBT ) is one excellent exam - ple for a low HOMO ( -5.45 eV ) as required by the ' ideal ' πconjugated polymers , which led to a high V OC value over 0.8 V and outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures. 5 The initial PCE reached 3.6% 6 in a typical BHJ device and has been subsequently improved to exceeding 6% by BHJ layer thickness optimization and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures. 7 However , the bandgap of PCDTBT is still relatively larger than the proposed 1.5 - 1.7 eV of the ideal polymers for PCEs exceeding 10% . Recently , to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT without sacrificing its high V OC , Hsu et al. 8 and our group 9 independently reported PCDTBT - based ladder - type polymers with forced planarity of which device performance showed impressive PCEs of up to 4.59% with reduced bandgap ( ca. 0.2 eV ) in comparison with that of PCDTBT.
