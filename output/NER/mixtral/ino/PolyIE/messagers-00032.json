A strong interchain interaction between polymer chains in the solid state would result in the red - shifting of the absorption peak and the onset. Optical band - gaps of the polymers were obtained from the absorption onsets of the polymer films. The measured optical band gaps of the copolymers were in the range 1.95 - 1.82 eV. 3.4. Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to investigate the redox behavior of the polymers and to determine their HOMO and LUMO energy levels. 25 CV was performed under an Ar atmosphere in a solution of TBABF 4 ( 0.10 M ) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV / s and room temperature. A platinum plate was used as a working electrode. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode , and a Ag / AgNO 3 electrode was used as the reference electrode. The HOMO energy level was determined by using oxidation onsets ( E ox ) of the polymer films. 26 The LUMO energy levels of the polymers were determined by combining the HOMO energy levels obtained from CV and the optical bandgap energies obtained from the edges of absorption. 26 To obtain the oxidation potentials of the polymer films , the reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) salt couple , whose redox potential is assumed to have an absolute energy level of -4.80 eV in a vacuum. 26 The potential of this external standard determined under the same conditions was 0.4 eV. As a result , the HOMO energy values were calculated using the equation E HOMO = -(E ox onset + 4.4 ) eV , where E ox onset is the onset oxidation potential vs Ag / Ag + . The HOMO energy levels of PFDTBT , PFD2TBT , and the ter-polymers were determined to lie in the range from -5.58 to -5.41 eV. Optical band gap energies show little change with by changing perylene unit ratios , but the HOMO energy levels of the polymers were moved slightly toward higher positions with the introduction of perylene units , as illustrated in Figure 4. This arises from the result of a decrease in the contents of high electron affinity DTBT units as the number of perylene units in the polymers increased. 27 The UV - visible absorption spectra , optical band - gaps , and HOMO / LUMO energy levels of the polymers are summarized in Table 2. 3.5. TFT Characteristics of the Polymer Thin Films. To measure the field effect mobility of the charge carriers , OTFT were fabricated on a silicon wafer using a bottom contact geometry ( channel length L = 12 μm , and width , W = 120 μm ) under nitrogen.
