In contrast , for (BDTT-TPD)-(BDTT-DPP)-(BDTT-TPD) , the electron density distribution in the HOMO wave function is different from those of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 5c,d ). Therefore , the small portions of DPP could hinder the preseparation of an exciton into a loosely Coulombically bound exciton , which suppresses electron transfer from donor ( polymer ) to acceptor ( PCBM ). 48-50 Therefore , one possible explanation of the lower PCEs in P5 and P6 is that the DPP acts as a trapping site , resulting in poor intramolecular charge transfer. In contrast , as evidenced in the results of the DFT calculations for (BDTT-DPP)-(BDTT-TPD)-(BDTT-DPP) , the electron distribution in the HOMO and LUMO wave functions is similar to those of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 ( Figures 5a,b ). Such a trapping effect is expected to be trivial in P2 and P3 random terpolymers with a higher DPP to TPD ratio. Therefore , the incorporation of different electron - deficient units could significantly influence the intramolecular charge transfer , suggesting that the optimum composition is required to tune the intra-and intermolecular charge transfer and their performance of PSCs. More detailed studies are currently underway. Finally , to further improve the PCE of P3 : PC71BM , methanol was spin - coated on the top of the active layer before electrode deposition. The effect of a polar solvent in such a case has been reported. 51-53 The P3 : PC71BM device exhibited a V OC of 0.76 V , a J SC of 16.32 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.51 with a high PCE value of 6.33% .
