PffBB-n exhibited not only strong and wide absorption but also controllable aggregation behavior in solution and thin films , in which aggregation behavior was greatly influenced by the length of alkyl side chains attached , temperature applied , and solvent used. Aggregation - induced spectral broadening further extended the absorption cutoff to ∼ 780 nm in thin films , leading to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Because of the strong aggregation strength , PffBB-n equipped with long alkyl side chains shows enhanced ordered molecular packing and good crystallinity as revealed by X-ray diffraction studies. In addition , temperature - dependent aggregation of the PffBB-n:PC71BM blend was investigated and optimized in the PSC fabrication.
