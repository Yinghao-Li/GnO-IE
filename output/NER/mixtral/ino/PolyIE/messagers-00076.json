Photovoltaic Properties. The photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers were investigated with a conventional device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 40 nm ) / polym e r : P C 7^1 B M ( 8^0 n m ) / p o l y [ ( 9 , 9 -b i s ( 3 ′ -( N , Ndimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene) ] ( PFN ) ( 5 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ) , here a thin layer of PFN was employed as the cathode interlayer since it can improve the electron extraction. 56-58 We chose PC71BM as the acceptor because it had much stronger absorption in the visible region than PC61BM , which can complement the absorption valley of the polymers and beneficial for high - efficiency PSCs. 59 The BHJ photoactive layer was prepared by spin - coating chlorobenzene solution of the polymer : PC71BM with weight ratio of 1 : 2 on the top of PEDOT : PSS layer without further treatment.
