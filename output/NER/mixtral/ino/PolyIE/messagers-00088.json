The resulting photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables S1 , S2 , and S3 , respectively. The optimized ratio of 1 : 1.3 , thickness of 80 nm , and annealing temperature of 120 °C were obtained. In these optimized conditions , two typical devices using PC71BM and PC61BM as acceptor exhibited the following typical J-V characteristics in Figure 2 under 1000 W m -2 air mass 1.5 global ( AM 1.5G ) illumination. Device parameters , such as J SC , V OC , FF , and PCE are deduced from the J-V characteristics and summarized in Table 3. It is clear that the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM - based devices exhibited better photovoltaic properties as compared to the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC61BM - based devices , which can be attributed to the stronger absorption of PC71BM than PC61BM in the visible region from 440 to 530 nm , as shown in Figure 1b. A maximal PCE of 4.89% with an V OC of 0.84 V , a J SC of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 56.0% was achieved for the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM - based devices. To our best knowledge , the recorded maximum PCE and FF levels here are higher than those for the previous side - chain D-A conjugated copolymersbased PSCs. Furthermore , these PSCs based on the side - chain D-A polymer of PBDT-TDPP-S presented significantly improved device performance over those PSCs using a mainchain D-A polymer of PDPP - BDT or PBDTPP-OR as donor. 7 Figure 3 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) curve of the device with the PBDT-TDPP-S : PC71BM blend. The EQE values are about 45% with a broad response from 300 to 750 nm , which are consistent with the optical absorption profile in Figure 1b. According to the EQE curve and the solar irradiation spectrum , the integral current density value of the device is 9.70 mA cm^-2 . The difference between the measured J SC and the integral current density values is within 3% . It indicates that our photovoltaic measurement is accurate and reliable. The moderate EQE reported here implies some potential for further enhancement in J SC as well. To assess the charge transport properties for the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM blend used as photoactive layer , we measured the J-V characteristics of single charge carrier devices at room temperature and applied space-charge-limited-current ( SCLC ) model to extract the charge carrier mobility.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
