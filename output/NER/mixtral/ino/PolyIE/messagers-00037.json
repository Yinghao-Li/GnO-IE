In the past few years , spirobifluorene has been used as an ideal building block in construction of stable blue light - emitting materials. 11 In the spiro - annulated molecules , the two perpendicular conjugated moieties are connected with the sp 3 -hybridized carbon atom as the spiro center. This structural feature can minimize the extravagant aggregation of polymers containing spiro - annulated molecules and thus can improve their solubility and processability. 11,12 Furthermore , the spirobifluorene structure can prevent the possible photo / thermal oxidation of the 9-position of the fluorene unit to form the undesired low energy ketonic defect. 13 In theory , stable polymer structures are beneficial for the long lifetime of polymer solar cells. Here , we demonstrate for the first time that spirobifluorene can be a very useful building block to construct main chain donor - acceptor alternating conjugated polymer , poly[2,7-(3′,6′-dioctyloxy)-9,9′-spirobifluorene-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-5′,6′-dioctyloxy-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] ( PSFDTBT ) as shown in Scheme 1 , for high efficiency polymer solar cells. The octyloxy chains on spirobifluorene and 2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole units can provide PSFDTBT with good solubility in common organic solvents. The transport properties of the polymer are investigated by fabricating organic thin film field - effect transistors ( OFETs ). The pristine PSFDTBT film spin - cast from DCB solution exhibited hole mobility of 7.26 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10^5 . The PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films show hole mobility of 1.14 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and an electron mobility of 2.7 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Under simulated solar illumination of AM 1.5G ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) , a PCE of 4.6% has been achieved for PSCs composed of PSFDTBT and PC71BM as the active layer in simply processed devices. The devices illustrate a considerably high V oc of 0.94 V , a J sc of 8.0 mA / cm^2 , and a comparable fill factor ( FF ) of 0.60. All device measurements were conducted in air without any encapsulation. Noticeably , PSFDTBT exhibits significantly improved PSC performance when compares with the analogous 9,9-dialkyl-9H-fluorene based polymer P1 ( Scheme 1 ) , which showed general PSC performance with PCE of about 3.1% in our previous report.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
