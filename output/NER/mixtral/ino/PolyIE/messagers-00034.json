This may be why the short circuit current of the device fabricated using PFDTBT_20Per is lower than that of PFDTBT , despite it higher mobility. The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the best photovoltaic performance among the PFDTBT - based polymers ( V oc = 0.74 V , J sc = 7.19 mA / cm^2 , PCE = 2.16% ). For the photovoltaic devices fabricated using PFD2TBT - based polymers , the shortcircuit currents of the devices also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased ; however , the PCEs of the devices using PFD2TBT - based polymers were lower than those of PFDTBT - based polymers because of lower open - circuit voltages and short - circuit currents.

Figure 8 shows that the J-V characteristics of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices provide a similar trend to those of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices but their PCEs increased mainly due to increased short circuit currents. The increase in the short circuit current originates from the introduction of the thin titanium suboxide ( TiO x ) layer ( ca. ∼ 10 nm ). The titanium suboxide layer could block holes to the aluminum electrode , thus it could increase the short circuit current of the photovoltaic device. The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the highest PCE of 3.16% with an open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , a short circuit current of 9.61 mA / cm^2 and the highest fill factor ( 0.41 ) among the fabricated devices. The characteristics of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices are summarized in Table 5.
