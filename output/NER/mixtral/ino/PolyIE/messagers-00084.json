    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. The paragraph mentions a \"lower PCE\" for the non-fullerene PSC, but it does not provide a specific value for the PCE of this device. Therefore, we cannot include PCE as a value for a material property.\n2. The paragraph states that the non-fullerene PSC has a PCE of \"over 4%.\" This gives us the first value and unit: 4% (PCE).\n3. The paragraph mentions that the PSCs fabricated from PTATDPP and PTAFDPP with PC71BM exhibit PCEs as high as 7.02% and 5.22%, respectively. This gives us two more values and units: 7.02% (PCE) and 5.22% (PCE).\n4. The paragraph also states that PTATDPP shows a promising PCE of 4.23% when a non-fullerene acceptor (di-PBI) is used as an electron acceptor material for the PSC device. This gives us another value and unit: 4.23% (PCE).\n5. The paragraph mentions that the copolymer composed of TA and DPP units shows a \"low band gap.\" However, it does not provide a specific value for the band gap. Therefore, we cannot include band gap as a value for a material property.\n6. The paragraph states that the copolymer has a \"low-lying HOMO energy level.\" However, it does not provide a specific value for the HOMO energy level. Therefore, we cannot include HOMO energy level as a value for a material property.\n7. The paragraph mentions that the copolymer has \"high crystallinity\" and \"efficient charge transporting characteristics.\" However, these are not quantifiable properties with units. Therefore, we cannot include them as values for material properties.\n\nIn summary, the material properties mentioned in the paragraph with their corresponding values and units are:\n\n* 4% (PCE) for the non-fullerene PSC\n* 7.02% (PCE) for the PSC fabricated from PTATDPP and PC71BM\n* 5.22% (PCE) for the PSC fabricated from PTAFDPP and PC71BM\n* 4.23% (PCE) for the PSC fabricated from PTATDPP and di-PBI."},
