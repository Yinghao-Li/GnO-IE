The PQCDTB dissolved in general organic solvents , and the M n was 49.8 kg / mol. The optical band gap energy was 1.92 eV , which was similar to the band gap of benzothiadiazole. The HOMO and LUMO levels of PQCDTB were -5.24 eV and -3.32 eV , respectively. According to the XRD measurement , PQCDTB showed the formation of ordered lamellar structure as an out - of - plane peak ( h00 ) by the alkyl side chain of quinacridone and conventional edge-on πstacking. This study also evaluated the OPV characteristics by fabricating a bulk - heterojunction - type polymer solar cell. When PQCDTB and PC71BM were fabricated in a 1 : 1 weight ratio , the open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short - circuit current ( J SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8% and 2.5% , respectively.
