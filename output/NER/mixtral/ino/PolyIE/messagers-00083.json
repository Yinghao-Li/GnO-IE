When the morphologies of active layers were observed by transmission electron microscopy , the PTATDPP : PC71BM blend shows clearly a fibril nanostructure ( fibril width ∼ 30 nm ) with the formation of a bi-continuous network , whereas the PTAFDPP : PC71BM blend shows a phase - separated morphology without the formation of distinct nanostructures , as shown in Fig. 5. It is well recognized that the nanoscale phase separation with a fibril structure is favourable for an efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport which are the prerequisites for high J SC and FF of PSCs. Therefore , the high FF ( 0.68 ) of PTATDPP - based device arises mainly from the efficient charge - carrier mobility and the formation of a nanoscale fibril structure of PTATDPP. To further evaluate the potential of PTATDPP as an electron donor material for PSCs , we fabricated a non-fullerene PSC device by blending PTATDPP with a non-fullerene small molecular electron acceptor , 2,2′9,9′-tetra(undecan-6-yl)- [ 5,5′bianthra (2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′)diisoquinolin]-1,1′,3,3′,8,8′,10,10′- (2H,2′H,9H,9′H)-octaone ( di-PBI ). 38 As can be seen in Fig. 6a , PTATDPP and di-PBI have well - matched energy levels with a LUMO - LUMO offset of 0.4 eV , 39 which is enough for exciton dissociation , and also exhibit complementary absorption , i.e. , di-PDI and PTATDPP absorb 400-600 nm and 600-800 nm , respectively. As a consequence , the blend film ( 1 : 2 in weight ratio ) exhibits a broad light absorption from 400 to 800 nm. The compatibility of PTATDPP and di-PBI as an electron donor and an acceptor , respectively , was also examined by monitoring the photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching of each compound in the blend film. As shown in Fig. 6c , the blend film shows excellent PL quenching over 95% of each PL from PTATDPP and di-PBI , indicating that photogenerated excitons from both PTATDPP and di-PBI are readily dissociated into free carriers at the interface of two materials. The non-fullerene PSC fabricated from the blend of PTATDPP and di-PBI exhibits a PCE of 4.23% with V OC = 0.77 V , J SC = 9.8 mA cm^-2 and FF = 0.56 ( Fig. 7 ). Interestingly , the blend morphology of PTATDPP and di-PDI as observed from atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and TEM reveals that PTATDPP forms a well - developed interconnected BHJ morphology with a fibrillar nanostructure ( Fig. S4 and S5 † ). This fibril morphology affords the effective exciton dissociation as observed from the PL quenching experiment.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
