CIN (Chemical): CIN stands for Contrast-Induced Nephropathy, which is a type of kidney damage caused by the use of contrast dye in medical imaging procedures.\n\n2. Bevacizumab (Chemical): Bevacizumab is a medication used to treat various types of cancer by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels.\n\n3. Irinotecan (Chemical): Irinotecan is a chemotherapy medication used to treat different types of cancer, including colorectal cancer.\n\n4. Hypertension (Disease): Hypertension refers to high blood pressure, which is a chronic medical condition.\n\nSo, the identified \"Disease\" entity is \"Hypertension,\" and the identified \"Chemical\" entities are \"CIN,\" \"Bevacizumab,\" and \"Irinotecan.\""},
