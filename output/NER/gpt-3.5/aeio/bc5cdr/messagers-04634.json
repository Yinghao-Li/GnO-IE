The age-related decrease in hypothalamic dopamine function: This phrase does not mention any specific disease or chemical. It describes a decrease in dopamine function in the hypothalamus due to aging.\n\n2. PRL secretion: PRL stands for prolactin, which is a hormone. In this context, it refers to the secretion of prolactin.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
