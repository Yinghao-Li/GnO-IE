Immunofluorescence: This is a technique used in biology and medicine to detect the presence of specific proteins or molecules in a sample. It is not a disease or a chemical.\n\n2. P2X3: This is a receptor protein that is involved in pain signaling. It is a chemical entity.\n\n3. NK1: This refers to the neurokinin-1 receptor, which is involved in the transmission of pain signals. It is also a chemical entity.\n\n4. Bladder: This refers to the organ in the human body that stores urine. It is not a disease or a chemical.\n\nTherefore, the identified \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" entities in the paragraph are P2X3 and NK1."},
