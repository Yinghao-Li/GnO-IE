Effective topical antimicrobial agents: This phrase refers to a type of chemical used to treat infections. The entity here is \"Chemical\".\n\n2. infection: This refers to a disease or condition. The entity here is \"Disease\".\n\n3. mortality: This refers to the occurrence of death. While it is not explicitly mentioned as a disease, it is related to the outcome of the disease. We can consider it as a related entity to \"Disease\".\n\n4. burn patients: This refers to a group of patients who have suffered burns. While it is not explicitly mentioned as a disease, it is a specific condition that can lead to infections and mortality. We can consider it as a related entity to \"Disease\".\n\nSo, the identified \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n- infection\n- mortality\n- burn patients\n- Effective topical antimicrobial agents"},
