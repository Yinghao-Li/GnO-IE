Female sex: This is not a disease or a chemical entity.\n3. Redo cardiac surgery: This is not a disease or a chemical entity.\n4. Calcification of ascending aorta: This is not a chemical entity, but it can be considered a disease entity.\n5. Congestive heart failure: This is a disease entity.\n6. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest: This is not a disease or a chemical entity.\n7. Duration of aortic cross-clamp: This is not a disease or a chemical entity.\n8.
