Disease entity: The paragraph mentions \"atrioventricular (AV) dissociation\" as a condition. So, \"atrioventricular dissociation\" is the disease entity.\n\n2. Chemical entity: The paragraph mentions \"oral verapamil\" as a medication. So, \"verapamil\" is the chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the identified \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n- Disease: atrioventricular dissociation\n- Chemical: verapamil"},
