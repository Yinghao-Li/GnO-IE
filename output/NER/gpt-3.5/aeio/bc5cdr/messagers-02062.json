Let's break down the paragraph and identify the entities.\n\n1. \"Microglial cells\" - This is a type of cell, so it can be classified as a \"Disease\" entity.\n\n2. \"CCR2\" - This is a label or marker for a specific type of cell, so it can be classified as a \"Chemical\" entity.\n\n3. \"SE rats\" - This refers to a specific group of rats, but it does not fall under the category of \"Disease\" or \"Chemical\" entities.\n\nSo, the identified entities are:\n\n- Disease: Microglial cells\n- Chemical: CCR2"},
