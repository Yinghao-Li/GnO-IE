Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" and \"Chemical\" entities.\n\n1. \"Posterior leukoencephalopathy due to calcineurin-inhibitor-related neurotoxicity\" - In this phrase, \"Posterior leukoencephalopathy\" is the disease entity, and \"calcineurin-inhibitor\" is the chemical entity.\n\n2. \"immunosuppressive agents\" - In this phrase, \"immunosuppressive agents\" can be considered as a general term for chemicals used in treatment, but it does not specify a particular chemical.\n\nSo, the identified entities are:\n\n- Disease: Posterior leukoencephalopathy\n- Chemical: Calcineurin-inhibitor"},
