Efficacy of everolimus (RAD001): In this phrase, \"everolimus\" is a chemical entity. It is also known by its chemical name \"RAD001\".\n\n2. patients with advanced NSCLC: In this phrase, \"NSCLC\" refers to non-small cell lung cancer, which is a disease entity.\n\n3. previously treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors: In this phrase, \"chemotherapy\" is a chemical entity. \"EGFR inhibitors\" refers to a class of drugs that target the epidermal growth factor receptor, which is a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the identified \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n- Disease: NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer)\n- Chemical: everolimus (RAD001), chemotherapy, EGFR inhibitors"},
