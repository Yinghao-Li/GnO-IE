Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" entities:\n\n1. \"Previous studies\" - This is not a \"Disease\" or \"Chemical\" entity.\n\n2. \"ecstasy users\" - This refers to individuals who use the drug ecstasy. \"Ecstasy\" is a \"Chemical\" entity.\n\n3. \"neurocognitive and sleep-related impairments\" - This refers to the specific impairments experienced by ecstasy users. \"Neurocognitive\" and \"sleep-related\" are not \"Disease\" or \"Chemical\" entities, but \"impairments\" can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the identified \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n- Ecstasy (Chemical)\n- Impairments (Disease)"},
