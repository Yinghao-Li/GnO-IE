Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" and \"Chemical\" entities.\n\n1. \"4 cases of endometrial carcinoma referred from elsewhere\" - In this phrase, the disease entity is \"endometrial carcinoma\".\n\n2. \"inappropriate and unsupervised unopposed oestrogen therapy\" - In this phrase, the chemical entity is \"oestrogen\".\n\n3. \"severe hyperplasia from malignancy\" - In this phrase, there is no specific chemical entity mentioned, but the disease entity is \"malignancy\".\n\nSo, the identified entities are:\n\n- Disease: endometrial carcinoma, malignancy\n- Chemical: oestrogen"},
