It refers to a specific protein level.\n\n2. delayed and peak gadolinium contrast enhancement - \"gadolinium contrast enhancement\" is a chemical entity.\n\n3. histopathological grading - This is not a disease or a chemical. It refers to a grading system used in histopathology.\n\n4. diastolic dysfunction - This is a disease entity.\n\nSo, in the given paragraph, the identified \"Disease\" entity is \"diastolic dysfunction\" and the identified \"Chemical\" entity is \"gadolinium contrast enhancement\"."},
