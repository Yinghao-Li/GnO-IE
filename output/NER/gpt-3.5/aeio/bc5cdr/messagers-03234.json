Swedish interactive threshold algorithm - short wavelength automated perimetry Humphrey visual field analysis - This is a technical term related to a diagnostic test, but it does not refer to a specific disease or chemical.\n\n5. electroretinographic parameters - This refers to a specific diagnostic parameter, \"electroretinographic parameters,\" but it does not specify a particular disease or chemical.\n\n6. optical coherence tomography - This refers to a specific diagnostic test, \"optical coherence tomography,\" but it does not specify a particular disease or chemical.\n\nTherefore, in this paragraph, the identified entities are \"ocular inflammation\" and \"retinal vasculitis.\""},
