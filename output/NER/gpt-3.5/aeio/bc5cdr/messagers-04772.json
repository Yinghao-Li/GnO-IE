Effects of 17alpha - ethinylestradiol (EE) on the neutral and acidic biosynthetic pathways of bile salt (BS) synthesis were evaluated in rats with an intact enterohepatic circulation and in rats with long-term bile diversion to induce BS synthesis.\n\nIn this sentence, the \"Chemical\" entity is \"17alpha - ethinylestradiol (EE)\" and the \"Disease\" entity is not mentioned.\n\n2. The paragraph does not mention any other \"Disease\" or \"Chemical\" entities.\n\nTherefore, the identified \"Chemical\" entity is \"17alpha - ethinylestradiol (EE)\" and there is no mentioned \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph."},
