However, there are some terms that could potentially be related to diseases or chemicals. Let's analyze them:\n\n1. IDR (Intradermal skin test): This is a type of skin test used to diagnose allergies. While it is not explicitly mentioned as a disease or a chemical, it is related to medical testing and can be associated with diseases or chemicals.\n\n2. Patch tests: Patch tests are also used to diagnose allergies. Similar to IDR, it is not explicitly mentioned as a disease or a chemical, but it is related to medical testing and can be associated with diseases or chemicals.\n\n3. PRC (Potentially Reactive Chemicals): This term refers to chemicals that may cause an allergic reaction. It is explicitly mentioned as a chemical in the paragraph.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified entities related to diseases and chemicals in the paragraph are:\n\n- IDR (related to disease)\n- Patch tests (related to disease)\n- PRC (related to chemical)"},
