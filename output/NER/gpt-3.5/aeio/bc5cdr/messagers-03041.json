  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" entities.\n\n1. Field potential duration (FPD) - This is not a disease or a chemical entity. It refers to a measurement or parameter.\n\n2. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) - This is not a disease or a chemical entity. It refers to a type of cells.\n\n3. QT interval - This is not a disease or a chemical entity. It refers to a measurement in an electrocardiogram.\n\n4. K(+) channel and Ca(2+) channel blockers - These are chemical entities. K(+) channel blockers refer to drugs that block potassium channels, and Ca(2+) channel blockers refer to drugs that block calcium channels.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the paragraph, but the chemical entities mentioned are K(+) channel and Ca(2+) channel blockers."},
