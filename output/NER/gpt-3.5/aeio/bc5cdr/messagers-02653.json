Let's break down the paragraph and identify the entities.\n\n1. \"During her further 3 weeks inpatient admission\" - This does not contain any specific disease or chemical entity.\n\n2. \"the serum sodium ranged from 134 to 137 mmol / L\" - This mentions \"serum sodium,\" which is a chemical entity.\n\n3. \"during treatment with mirtazapine\" - This mentions \"mirtazapine,\" which is a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the identified entities are:\n\n- Chemical: \"serum sodium,\" \"mirtazapine\""},
