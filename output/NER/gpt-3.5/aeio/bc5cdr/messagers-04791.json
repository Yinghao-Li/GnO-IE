  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's break down the paragraph and identify the entities.\n\n1. \"Long-term efficacy and adverse event\" - This is not a specific disease or chemical entity. It refers to the overall effectiveness and potential side effects of a treatment.\n\n2. \"nifedipine sustained-release tablets\" - This is a chemical entity. Nifedipine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and angina. In this case, it is in the form of sustained-release tablets.\n\n3. \"cyclosporin A-induced hypertension\" - This is a disease entity. Cyclosporin A is a medication used to suppress the immune system, and one of its potential side effects is hypertension (high blood pressure).\n\n4. \"patients with psoriasis\" - This is not a specific disease or chemical entity. It refers to the group of individuals who have psoriasis, a chronic skin condition.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, the identified entities are:\n- Chemical entity: nifedipine sustained-release tablets\n- Disease entity: cyclosporin A-induced hypertension"},
