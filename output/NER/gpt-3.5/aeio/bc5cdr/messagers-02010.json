Wild-type (WT) and ILK: These are not specific diseases or chemicals. \"Wild-type\" refers to a type of organism or gene, and \"ILK\" is likely an abbreviation for a protein or gene. These are not considered \"Disease\" or \"Chemical\" entities.\n\n2. Liver: This is not a specific disease or chemical. \"Liver\" refers to an organ in the body and is not considered a \"Disease\" or \"Chemical\" entity.\n\n3. PB (0.1% in drinking water): This is a chemical entity. \"PB\" likely refers to a specific chemical compound, and \"0.1% in drinking water\" indicates the concentration or dosage. Therefore, \"PB\" is the identified \"Chemical\" entity.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned. The identified \"Chemical\" entity is \"PB\"."},
