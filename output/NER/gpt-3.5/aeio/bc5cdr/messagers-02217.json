Smad3 is a protein involved in cell signaling, and phosphorylated Smad3 refers to the modified form of this protein.\n\n2. immunoprecipitation: This is a technique used to isolate specific proteins or molecules from a mixture. It is not a disease or a chemical entity.\n\n3. Western blotting: This is a technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample. It is not a disease or a chemical entity.\n\n4. confocal microscopy: This is a technique used to obtain high-resolution images of a sample. It is not a disease or a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the only entity in the paragraph that falls under the \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" category is \"Phosphorylated Smad3\"."},
