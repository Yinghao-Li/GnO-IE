Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" entities.\n\n1. \"Electron microscopy\" - This is a technique or method used for examining the structure of cells and tissues at a very high resolution. It is not a disease or a chemical.\n\n2. \"myocardium\" - This refers to the muscular tissue of the heart. It is not a disease or a chemical.\n\n3. \"subcellular degeneration\" - This refers to the deterioration or breakdown of structures within a cell. It is not a disease or a chemical.\n\n4. \"mitochondrial changes\" - This refers to alterations or modifications in the mitochondria, which are the powerhouses of the cell. It is not a disease or a chemical.\n\n5. \"single dose\" - This refers to a specific amount of a substance administered at once. It is not a disease or a chemical.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no specific \"['Disease', 'Chemical']\" entities mentioned."},
