  {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"['Material Name', 'Property Name of Material', 'Value of Material Property']\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: The devices are structured as As shown in Figure 5a and Table 3 , the device that blended PQCDTB and PC61BM in a 1 : 1 ratio had an open - circuit voltage (V OC) of 0.76 V , a short - circuit current (J SC) of 4.4 mA cm^-2 , a fill factor (FF) of 47.5 % and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.6 % . In the device that blended the PQCDTB and PC71BM in a 1 : 1 ratio , V OC , J SC , and FF were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , and 55.8 % , respectively . In terms of PCE , approximately 56 % was improved with 2.5 % , compared with the device in which the PC61BM was applied as an acceptor . Because PC71BM is greater than PC61BM in terms of photon absorption at 400 - 500 nm , it was able to improve the PCE by increasing J SC . 6 The V oc of PQCDTB was greater than the widely known poly(3 - hexylthiophene) , P3HT (V oc = 0.5 - 0.6 V) . This type of result was obtained because PQCDTB (-5.53 eV) has a lower HOMO level than P3HT (-4.9 eV) . 19,24 The value of FF for PQCDTB (FF = 55.8 %) increased by 39 % compared to PCZDTB (FF = 40.1 %) . The series resistance at PQCDTB and PC71BM ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 , as shown in Table 3 , was 31 and 27 Ω / cm^2 , respectively . In contrast , the series resistance at PCZDTB and PC71BM ratio of 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 was 320 , 62 Ω / cm^2 , respectively . The series resistance of PQCDTB exhibited low value compared to that of PCZDTB . The decrease of series resistance could increase FF . PQCDTB showed high FF than PCZDTB due to decrease of series resistance by self - organization of quinacridone unit . 9 Figure 5b showed the external quantum efficiency (EQE) data of the fabricated device . When PQCDTB was used as a donor and PC61BM and PC71BM were used as acceptors , the device had 38 % and 41 % EQE at 480 nm , respectively . The photovoltaic devices with PC71BM as an acceptor showed higher EQE values than those with PC61BM as an acceptor , although they absorbed photons in the same range of the solar spectra . This was because PC71BM has a stronger UV - vis absorption property than does PC61BM in the visible region , especially near 500 nm . 30 Hence , the PCE improved with an increase in J SC . In a device that used PCZDTB as a donor , an EQE of 48 % was observed at 440 nm . Interestingly , λ max was blue - shifted by -30 nm because of the low π - π stacking and the weak intermolecular interaction of PCZDTB compared with PQCDTB .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
