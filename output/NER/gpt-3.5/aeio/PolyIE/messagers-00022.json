  {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"['Material Name', 'Property Name of Material', 'Value of Material Property']\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: In an attempt to further improve the performance of the PCDTBT - based polymer solar cells (PSCs) , we have synthesized a selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , PCDSeBT , in which diselenienylbenzothiadiazole (DSeBT) monomer alternately flanks with a 2,7 - carbazole unit . The intrinsic properties of PCDSeBT are not only characterized by UV - vis absorption , cyclic voltammetry (CV) , and organic field - effect transistors (OFETs) but also the surface morphology , mobilities of space charge - limited current (SCLC) model , and polymer solar cells (PSCs) in its bulkheterojunction (BHJ) active layer with [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are evaluated in detail . It is found that PCDSeBT simultaneously has a low - lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level at -5.4 eV and a low bandgap of 1.70 eV as required by the ideal polymers for BHJ PSCs . The high current of 11.7 mA / cm^2 is obtained for PCDSeBT - based PSCs , to our knowledge , which is among the highest short - circuit current density (J SC) values obtained from a BHJ device consisting of PCDTBT derivatives and [6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) . The high J SC value , along with a moderate fill factor (FF) of 45 % and a high open - circuit voltage (V OC) of 0.79 V , yields a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.12 % , which is about 37 % increase in PCE from a PCDTBT - based reference device . On the basis of our results , one can be concluded that the DSeBT placement for construction of donor (D)-acceptor (A) polymers is an easy and effective way to realize both the higher J SC and V OC values in PSCs , as a consequence of the selective lower - lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) with the HOMO being almost unchanged , together with the effective broadening on the absorption band . With deep understanding of efficient photoinduced electron transfer within an interpenetrating network by simple blending π - conjugated polymers (electron donor) with fullerene derivatives (electron acceptor) , 1 bulk - heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on poly(3 - hexylthiophene) (P3HT) : [6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) have been extensively investigated , leading to great progress in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4 - 5 % . 2 Yet , the PCE of P3HT - based PSCs is limited by its relatively large bandgap (∼ 1.9 eV) with major loss of the solar radiation as well as low open circuit - voltage (V OC ≅ 0.6 V) due to the relatively small energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
