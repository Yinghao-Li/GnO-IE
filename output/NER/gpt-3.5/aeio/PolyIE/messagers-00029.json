The lower bandgap with the broaden absorption band significantly improves a J SC of 11.7 mA / cm^2 , which is among the highest J SC values for PSCs based on PCDTBT derivatives , while the low HOMO energy level maintains the high V OC value . The corresponding PCE is 4.12 % , about 37 % higher than that obtained from a PCDTBT - based reference device . This work provides a feasible strategy for selective fine - tuning of LUMO levels , which achieves a high J SC value , while nearly remaining a high V OC . Therefore , further exploration of PCDSeBT - based PSCs is still warranted for high - performance PCEs by means of controlling the film morphology and improving electric contacts .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
