In order to develop high - performance side - chain D - A conjugated polymers , it is necessary to develop new catalog of side - chain D - A polymers for efficient PSCs . Given that benzo [1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit has a large planar molecular structure by fusing a benzene with two flanking thiophenyl units and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) , i.e. , pyrrolo[3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione unit has a well conjugated structure with strong π - π interaction and electron - withdrawing effect , some main - chain D - A copolymers based on DPP or / and BDT units as prime building block had been designed for optoelectronic applications in both thin - film transistors and solar cells in recent years . 6 It is worthy to note that PSCs based on these copolymers with a tandem structure showed an increasing PCE of 8.62 % . 2a Here we report another novel sidechain D - A conjugated copolymer (PBDT - TDPP - S) for highperformance PSCs , in which the BDT and thiophene units are conjugatedly formed the main chain and the di(thiophen-2yl)pyrrolo [3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (TDPP) units are pended onto the thiophenyl units to build the side chain by a linkage of a 2 - vinylthiophenyl unit . Using PBDT - TDPP - S as electron donor and PC71BM as electron acceptor , the resulting PSCs exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a PCE of 4.89 % , an open - circuit voltage (V OC) of 0.84 V , a shortcircuit current (J SC) of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 56.0 % . To our best knowledge , the efficiency is among the highest reported to date for side - chain D - A conjugated copolymers and is twice higher than that of the main - chain D - A counterpart polymer PBDTDPP - OR in the single BHJ PSCs . synthesized by a common Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh 3) 4 as catalyst with a high yield of 78.7 % , as shown in Scheme 1 . For comparison , the corresponding main - chain D - A conjugated copolymer of PBDT - DPP was made at the same time . The resulting PBDT - TDPP - S showed good solubility in common organic solvents , such as chlorobenzene , o - dichlorobenzene , and dichloromethane (DCM) , but PBDT - DPP was nearly not soluble in them . Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis showed that PBDT - TDPP - S has a numberaverage molecular weight (M n) of 1.34 × 10 ^ 4 g mol^-1 with a polydispersity index of 1.27 (Figure S1) . Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that PBDT - TDPP - S has high thermal stability with a degradation temperature (T d) of 364 ° C at 5 % weight loss . The corresponding molecular weights and thermal properties of PBDT - TDPP - S are summarized in Table 1 , and the recorded TGA curve is shown in Figure S2 (see Supporting Information) . The UV - vis absorption spectra of PBDT - TDPP - S in DCM solution and solid film are shown in Figure 1a .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
