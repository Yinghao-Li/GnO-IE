Because of the threedimensional structure of spirobifluorene units , PSFDTBT is readily dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform , chlorobenzene , toluene , THF , 1,2 - dichlorobenzene (DCB) , 1,2,4 - trichlorobenzene (TCB) , etc . at room temperature . Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that PSFDTBT is of good thermal stability with less than 5 % weight loss up to 340 ° C. No clear glass transition was observed from 25 to 300 ° C in its DSC curves of the second heating and cooling runs (20 ° C / min) . Optical and Electrochemical Properties . UV - vis absorption spectra of PSFDTBT in THF solution and in film are shown in Figure 1 . In THF solution , PSFDTBT exhibited a broad absorption in the range of ultraviolet to visible region with two peaks located at 395 and 527 nm , respectively . In film , the absorption of PSFDTBT became broader and slightly redshifted with two peaks located at 401 and 562 nm , respectively . In comparison with the absorption spectrum in solution , the absorption spectrum in film became broader and red - shifted for about 35 nm , indicating the aggregation or ordered packing of polymer chains in solid state . Ordered packing of polymer chains is beneficial for improving the charge mobility of resulting films . 14 The optical absorption onset of PSFDTBT film is at 629 nm , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.97 eV. PC71BM was chosen as the acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PC61BM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region with a broad peak from 440 to 530 nm , which compensates the absorption valley of the polymer . 15 As shown in Figure 1 , the PSFDTBT / PC71BM blending film (1 : 3 by weight) has a strong absorption over a broad wavelength range of 400 ^ -700 nm . The electrochemical properties of PSFDTBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) . The HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT was determined to be -5.40 eV according to the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71) (eV) , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential in volts vs Ag / Ag + . 16 Since the open circuit voltage V oc of BHJ PSCs is correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , 5,17 therefore a higher V oc for PSFDTBT based polymer solar cells is anticipated due to the low - lying HOMO energy level .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
