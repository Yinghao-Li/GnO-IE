A strong interchain interaction between polymer chains in the solid state would result in the red - shifting of the absorption peak and the onset . Optical band - gaps of the polymers were obtained from the absorption onsets of the polymer films . The measured optical band gaps of the copolymers were in the range 1.95 - 1.82 eV. 3.4 . Electrochemical Properties . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the redox behavior of the polymers and to determine their HOMO and LUMO energy levels . 25 CV was performed under an Ar atmosphere in a solution of TBABF 4 (0.10 M) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV / s and room temperature . A platinum plate was used as a working electrode . A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode , and a Ag / AgNO 3 electrode was used as the reference electrode . The HOMO energy level was determined by using oxidation onsets (E ox) of the polymer films . 26 The LUMO energy levels of the polymers were determined by combining the HOMO energy levels obtained from CV and the optical bandgap energies obtained from the edges of absorption . 26 To obtain the oxidation potentials of the polymer films , the reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene / ferrocenium (Fc / Fc +) salt couple , whose redox potential is assumed to have an absolute energy level of -4.80 eV in a vacuum . 26 The potential of this external standard determined under the same conditions was 0.4 eV. As a result , the HOMO energy values were calculated using the equation E HOMO = -(E ox onset + 4.4) eV , where E ox onset is the onset oxidation potential vs Ag / Ag + . The HOMO energy levels of PFDTBT , PFD2TBT , and the ter - polymers were determined to lie in the range from -5.58 to -5.41 eV. Optical band gap energies show little change with by changing perylene unit ratios , but the HOMO energy levels of the polymers were moved slightly toward higher positions with the introduction of perylene units , as illustrated in Figure 4 . This arises from the result of a decrease in the contents of high electron affinity DTBT units as the number of perylene units in the polymers increased . 27 The UV - visible absorption spectra , optical band - gaps , and HOMO / LUMO energy levels of the polymers are summarized in Table 2 . 3.5 . TFT Characteristics of the Polymer Thin Films . To measure the field effect mobility of the charge carriers , OTFT were fabricated on a silicon wafer using a bottom contact geometry (channel length L = 12 μm , and width , W = 120 μm) under nitrogen . The TFT devices of the polymers exhibited typical p - channel transistor characteristics .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
