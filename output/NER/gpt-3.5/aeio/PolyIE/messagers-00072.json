Such NTbased polymers exhibit 1 order of magnitude increased hole mobility in conjunction with obviously improved photovoltaic properties with respect to the corresponding BT version , which can be ascribed to the centrosymmetric structure of NT that can lead to straighter backbone and more favorable side - chain placement than the axisymmetric BT structure . 25,26 The fact indicates that NT is a versatile acceptor for high performance D - A type of conjugated polymers . Recently , indacenodithiophene (IDT) with two thiophene rings held in a rigid arrangement via a central phenyl ring has emerged as a promising donor moiety for D - A polymers due to its good solubility and highly planar structures (Scheme 1) . 27 - 31 Ting et al . synthesized random and alternating copolymers based on IDT and BT and the highest PCE reached 6.4 % based on the corresponding PSCs . 28,32,33 Jen et al . studied several high performance D - A copolymers with IDT and different acceptor units . 29,34 - 37 The IDT - based polymers presented deep HOMO levels and hence lead to considerably high V oc of the resulted devices . Additionally , IDT - based polymers have presented pretty high mobility and the appropriate optical properties , which can facilitate the charge transport together with enhance the absorption of sunlight and subsequently lead to high J sc . 38 Therefore , both IDT and NT are promising building blocks for D - A type low band gap polymers and the combination of the outstanding properties of IDT and NT may develop a series of promising donor materials for high performance PSCs . In this manuscript , we report the synthesis and characterization of three D - A type IDT - NT based low band gap conjugated polymers , poly[2,7-(4,4,9,9 - tetra(p - octylphenyl)-s- indaceno[1,2 - b:5,6 - b′]-dithiophene)-alt-3,7-(di(4-(2 - ethylhex- yl)-2 - thienyl)-naphtho[1,2 - c:5,6 - c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole) ] (PIDT - EHNT) , poly[2,7-(4,4,9,9 - tetra(p - octylphenyl)-s- indaceno[1,2 - b:5,6 - b′]-dithiophene)-alt-3,7-(di(4 - hexyl-2thienyl)-naphtho[1,2 - c:5,6 - c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole) ] (PIDT - DTNT) and poly[2,7-(4,4,9,9 - tetra(p - octylphenyl)-s - indaceno-[1,2 - b:5,6 - b′]-dithiophene)-alt-3,7-(di(3′-dodecyl-5-(2,2′-bithienyl))-naphtho[1,2 - c:5,6 - c]bis(1,2,5 - thiadiazole) )] (PIDT - C12NT) (Scheme 2) , by using IDT as a weak donor and NT as a strong acceptor .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
