  {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"['Material Name', 'Property Name of Material', 'Value of Material Property']\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: For (PCPDTBT) , which showed absorption in the range 380 - 900 nm in the AM 1.5 G spectrum , good hole mobility (0.01 - 0.1 cm^2 V -1 s^-1) and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.2 % with PC71BM as the electron acceptor . 8,9 A 9.9dialkylfluorene unit has previously been used as a building block for constructing donor - acceptor - type conjugated polymers in OPVs such as poly[2,7-(9,9′-dialkylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2 - thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) ] (PFDTBT) . PFDTBT showed a maximum PCE of 2.2 % , and PFDTBT derivatives containing branched alkyl chains (BisDMO - PFDTBT) showed higher PCEs . 10,11 Some molecules and polymers that have flat structures such as fluorene , 12 - 16 anthracene , 17 and pyrene 18,19 have been reported to form excimers or aggregates by strong interchain π - π interactions . Excimer formation could affect the emission properties of molecules or polymers , therefore , the excimer or exciplex formation has been used as a fluorescence probe for molecular recognition . 19 In organic photovoltaic devices , π - π interactions between low - band gap donor polymers are important for charge transportation . Enhanced π - π interactions in p - type donor polymers could improve their chargetransport ability , and thus increase short - circuit currents in solar cells . In this study we report on a new approach to improve PCE of OPVs by enhancing the interchain π - π interaction . To do this we introduced flat perylene units into the conjugated polymers . We synthesized poly[2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2 - thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) ] (PFDTBT) , poly[2,2′-(9,9 - dioctylfluorene-2,7 - diyl)dithiophene - alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2 - thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) ] (PFD2TBT) , and their ter - polymers with perylene units . Optical , electrical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated . Synthetic routes and polymer structures are shown in Schemes 1 and 2 . The UV - visible absorption spectra of the synthesized polymers were recorded in both chloroform solution and as a solid thin film . PFDTBT and the ter - polymer solutions exhibited two distinct absorption bands , where the first absorption peak is at around 387 nm , corresponding to the π - π * transition of the conjugated polymer backbone , 23,24 and the second absorption band in the longer wavelength region at around 530 nm , can be attributed to the strong internal charge - transfer (ICT) interaction between donating and accepting groups in the main chain . 21 Peak and edge positions were almost equivalent for PFDTBT , PFDTBT_5Per and PFDTBT_10Per , but the maximum absorption peak for PFDTBT_20Per moved to a shorter wavelength region . This might be due to a decrease in the internal charge - transfer (ICT) interaction cause by a decreased content of electron - withdrawing DTBT monomer in the copolymer . PFD2TBT and the ter - polymer solutions also exhibited two absorption bands at around 410 and 520 nm . The absorption maxima and edges of the polymer solutions showed little dependence upon perylene contents . The UV - visible absorption spectra of the synthesized polymers in a chloroform solution are shown in Figure 2 .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
