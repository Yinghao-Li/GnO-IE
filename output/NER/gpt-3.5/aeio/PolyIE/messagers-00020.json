The former could be ruled out because the PEBDTPD polymer had a slightly higher LUMO level as the POBDTPD polymer . The latter was thus mainly responsible for the effective PL quenching , as confirmed from the film morphology studies . That is , the miscibility between polymers and PC 70 BM is an important factor for efficient exciton separation . Conclusively , morphology and PL quenching studies revealed that the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film has more favorable features for the higher J sc . Carrier mobilities were measured to estimate the ability of hole and electron transport and the carrier mobility balance . The hole mobilities of the polymers or the polymer : PC 70 BM blends were measured via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method using hole - only devices (ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer or polymer : PC 70 BM / Au) . The JL 3 -V characteristics of the polymers and the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films are shown in Figure 7 . For all films , a slope of 2 in the log JL 3 - log V plot was observed , which is a signature of SCLC transport . The hole mobilities of the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers were estimated to be 1.5 × 10 ^ -4 and 1.3 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively . Although these hole mobilities of homopolymers were nearly identical , the hole mobility in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film decreased only slightly to 1.2 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , whereas that in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film decreased significantly to 3.5 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The considerable mobility decrease in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film may result from the less uniform , more aggregated morphology as aforementioned . In addition , the electron mobilities of the polymer : PC 70 BM blends were measured using electron - only devices (Al / polymer : PC 70 BM / Al) . The electron mobilities were 8.8 × 10 ^ -6 and 1.1 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM and PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blends , respectively . The hole and electron mobilities of the polymers and polymer : PC 70 BM blends are summarized in Table 3 . From this carrier mobility measurement , we concluded that the higher hole mobility of the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blends contributed to the higher J sc values as well . Moreover , the lower FF for the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend can be explained in terms of the balance between hole and electron transport .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
