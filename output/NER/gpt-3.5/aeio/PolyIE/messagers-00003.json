Among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs fabricated , PffBB-14 with strongest aggregation strength / behavior exhibited the most promising photovoltaic performance , with a maximum PCE of 9.93 % , a large V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36 % . Such a superior device efficiency was attributed to the greatly enhanced exciton dissociation , higher and balanced charge carrier mobilities , and less recombination losses in the active layer of the PffBB-14 : PC71BM - based cells . Our results demonstrated that the modulation of aggregation behavior through structural modification and temperature tuning could effectively optimize the physical and optoelectronic properties of a material and device for solar cell applications . Synthesis and Physical Properties of Polymers . The PffBB - n (n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16) polymers were synthesized according to the optimized literature procedures and the synthetic scheme is shown in Scheme 1.^39 The Corey - House synthesis of 3 - bromothiophene and oxalyl dichloride gave 1,2di(thiophen-3 - yl)ethane-1,2 - dione (1) as a brown needle - like crystal in a good yield (70 %) . Oxidative cyclization of 1 in the presence of iron(III) chloride carried out in diluted dichloromethane (DCM) solution yielded a dark purple benzodithiophene-4,5 - diketone (2) crystal . Acetylation of 2 with Zn powder and acetic anhydride performed under basic conditions produced yellowish benzodithiophene-4,5 - diyl diacetate (3) powder in a good yield of 85 % . 3 was then alkylated with 2ethylhexyl bromide in the presence of Cs 2 CO 3 yielding 4,5bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)benzodithiophene (4) as a sticky colorless liquid . Proton abstraction of 4 by n - BuLi followed by the reaction with tri - butyltin chloride gave the polycondensation precursor , 4,5 - bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)-2,7 - bis(tri - n - butylstannyl)benzodithiophene (5) . To preserve high reactivity , the crude product was subjected to flash chromatography and kept under -20 ° C for the condensation reaction . Alkylation of the thiophene ring was carried out by Kumada coupling , yielding 3 - alkylthiophene as a colorless oil or a white solid (6 - 9) . Lithiation of alkylated thiophene followed by quenching with tri - butyltin chloride afforded tri - butyl(4alkylthiophene-2 - yl)stannane (10 - 13) . Subsequent coupling with 4,7 - dibromo-5,6 - difluorobenzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole afforded dithienyl - substituted difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole , 14 - 17 . NBS bromination of 14 - 17 produced the acceptor units , 18 - 21 , respectively , which were carefully purified through chromatography and recrystallization to ensure high reactivity for the condensation reaction . The Stille polycondensation reaction of donor unit 5 and acceptor units 18 - 21 was carried out under the catalyst of Pd(PPh 3) 4 in chlorobenzene solutions at 150 ° C for 3 days that could afford the corresponding polymers as a dark green solid . Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the molecular weight using polystyrene as the standard and 1,2,3 - trichlorobenzene as the eluent (Table 1) .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
