The PCDSeBT : PC71BM weight ratio was optimized from 1 : 1 , 1 : 2 , 1 : 3 , to 1 : 4 . The current - density - voltage (J - V) characteristics of the devices under the illumination of simulated AM 1.5 G conditions (100 mW / cm^2) are shown in Figure 4a and the parameters are summarized in Table 2 . Without extensive optimization , the initial device fabricated from the blend solutions with a PCDSeBT : PC71BM weight ratio of 1 : 1 shows a PCE of 0.73 % with a J SC of 2.98 mA / cm^2 , a V OC of 0.71 V , a fill factor (FF) of 35 % . As increasing the weight fraction of PC71BM , the PCEs are gradually increased . The device containing the 1 : 4 w / w blend as the photoactive layer after thermal annealing at 150 ° C delivers at superior performance with the J SC of 11.7 mA / cm^2 , V OC of 0.79 V , and FF of 45 % , improving the PCE to 4.12 % , an approximately 37 % enhance - ment in PCE , when compared to the reference cell based on PCDTBT : PC71BM for the sake of comparison (see SI) . 20 It is worth noting that the J SC , to the best of our knowledge , is among the highest J SC s reported to date for PCSs based on PCDTBT analogues , 5,8,21 in a good agreement with the 1.0 × 10 ^ -3 4.0 × 10 ^ 4 -13 a All device characteristics were obtained from the devices (L = 50 μm and W = 1.5 mm) based on OTS - treated Si / SiO 2 substrates . b The on / off current ratio (I on / I off) were extracted from the linear - regime transfer characteristics . In order to ensure the accuracy of the measurements , we investigated the incident photon - to - current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the optimized device (1 : 4 w / w) , exhibiting over 65 % at the energetically lower peak , i.e. at the λ max of PCDSeBT (Figure 4b) . The J SC value calculated by integrating the IPCE data with an AM 1.5 G reference spectrum is rather consistent with that obtained from J - V plots within 10 % error . Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to gain insight into the surface morphology of the optimized 1 : 4 w / w blend films (Figure 5) . The films before and after thermal annealing have smooth surface topographies and very similar features , where the formation of voids , typically attributed to incompatibility between donor and acceptor components , is not observed .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
