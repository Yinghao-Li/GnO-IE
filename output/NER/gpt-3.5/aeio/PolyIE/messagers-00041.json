These AFM results are consistent with their photovoltaic device performances (vide supra) . The reason for that may be due to both DCB and TCB are good solvents for PSFDTBT . It is well - known that balanced electron and hole mobility of the active layer is required for high performance polymer solar cells . 2f The formation of an interpenetrating bicontinuous network between polymer donor and PCBM with an ideal domain size of 10 - 20 nm is crucial for charge generation and transportation . 18 For bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells , appreciate phase separation is a practical way to form bicontinuous donor - acceptor network . 19 We believe that the solar cell performance of this type of copolymer can be further improved by the optimization of film morphology and device fabrication conditions . An alternating copolymer PSFDTBT of spirobifluorene and 2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole unit was designed and synthesized . PSFDTBT shows a broad absorption , appropriate HOMO / LUMO positions , and comparable hole mobility . Without using any additive and any post - treatment , polymer solar cells based on PSFDTBT / PC71BM demonstrated a PCE of 4.6 % with a high open - circuit voltage of 0.94 V. This is the first report on spirobifluorene - based polymers applied in BHJ PSCs . High open - circuit voltage , simple device fabrication process , and easy synthesis make PSFDTBT a highly promising donor polymers for high efficiency polymer solar cells . We believe that spirobifluorene as a promising building block for conjugated polymer donor materials warrants further exploration and the performance of PSFDTBT - based polymer solar cells can be further improved from the optimization of device fabrication conditions .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
