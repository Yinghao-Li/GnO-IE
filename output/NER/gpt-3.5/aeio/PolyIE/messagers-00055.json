  {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"['Material Name', 'Property Name of Material', 'Value of Material Property']\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: A new series of donor - acceptor (D - A) conjugated random terpolymers (PBDTT - DPP - TPD) were synthesized from electron - rich thienyl - substituted benzo[1,2b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene (BDTT) , in conjugation with two electron - deficient units , pyrrolo [3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione (DPP) and thieno [3,4 - c]pyrrole-4,6 - dione (TPD) , of different electron - withdrawing strengths . The optical properties of these random terpolymers can be easily controlled by tuning the ratio between DPP and TPD ; an increase in TPD induced increased absorption between 400 and 650 nm and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level , while higher DPP contents resulted in stronger absorption between 600 and 900 nm . The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.33 % was obtained from PBDTT - DPP75 - TPD25 with [6,6]-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) due to the improved light absorption and thus a short - circuit current density (J SC) higher than 16 mA / cm^2 . Interestingly , the trend observed in the PCE values differed from that of optical behavior of the PBDTT - DPP - TPD in terms of the DPP to TPD ratio , showing nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % . Density functional theory calculations showed that the small portions of strong electron - withdrawing DPP in PBDTT - DPP25 - TPD75 and PBDTT - DPP10 - TPD90 could provide trap sites , which suppress efficient charge transfer . In contrast , for PBDTT - DPP90 - TPD10 and PBDTT - DPP75 - TPD25 , the effect of minor portions of TPD on electron density distribution was found to be minimal . In addition , the polymer packing and nanomorphology were investigated by grazing - incidence X - ray scattering and atomic force microscopy . The findings suggested that controlling the ratio of electron - deficient units in the random terpolymers is critical for optimizing their performance in polymer solar cells because it affects the polymer packing structure , the optical and electrical properties , and the electron distribution in the polymers . Low - band - gap polymers for bulk - heterojunction (BHJ)-type polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been studied intensively with the aim of matching a greater part of the solar spectrum and thus harvesting more photon flux , to produce efficiencies greater than 7 - 9 % . 1 - 9 In most cases , low - band - gap polymers achieved by the donor - acceptor (D - A) approach do not show broad absorption , but instead the absorption maxima are redshifted , decreasing the number of absorbed photons in the visible region and ultimately limiting the achievable photocurrent . 10 - 13 One promising approach toward broadening the absorption of the solar spectrum is to develop random terpolymers based on the copolymerization of two different electron - rich units and one electron - deficient unit 14 - 16 or one electron - rich unit and two different electron - deficient units . 17 - 22 The judicious selection of two different electrondeficient or - rich groups with different electron - withdrawing or - donating strengths is critical to achieve complementary and broad visible light absorption , thus maximizing photon harvesting . However , successful examples of random terpolymers with broad light absorption and high efficiency are limited .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
