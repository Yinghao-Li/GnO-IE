The best devices of PDTP - BT and PDTP - DTBT show PCE of 1.64 % and 2.37 % , respectively . The polymer PDTP - DT2BT exhibits the highest PCE of 3.12 % , ascribed to the largest J SC = 11.43 mA cm^-2 with a slightly lower V OC of 0.54 V and a slightly higher FF of 0.57 than the other polymers . The V OC values of the devices are around 0.5 V , suggesting that the addition of the thienyl units does not affect the main chain distortion . This coincides well with similar HOMO energy levels for the copolymers measured by CV . These results indicate that the PCEs of the photovoltaic devices based on PDTP - DT2BT : PC 70 BM were higher than those of PDTP - DTBT : PC 70 BM and PDTP - BT : PC 70 BM . Overall , it is an effective approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - based copolymers by increasing the number of unsubstituted thienyl units along the copolymers backbone . Fig . 5 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots of the devices based on three copolymer : PC 70 BM combinations under the illumination of monochromatic light . With the increase of thienyl spacers , the EQE response wavelengths show a blue shift , a similar tendency to the absorption spectra , but the EQE peak values were higher in PDTP - DT2BT (58 %) compared to PDTP - BT (23 %) or PDTP - DTBT (42 %) . The shapes of the EQE curves of the devices in the range of 450 - 700 nm could be assigned to the stronger absorption of PC 70 BM . In conclusion , three low band gap D - A copolymers , based on the DTP donor and the BT acceptor , with different numbers of thienyl spacers along the backbone have been designed and synthesized . The thienyl spacer makes the absorption spectra peak blue - shift in the longer wavelength range and red - shift in the low wavelength range . Under 1.5 G^100 mW cm^-2 illumination , a best PCE of 3.12 % for PDTP - DT2BT was recorded , with V OC = 0.48 V , J SC = 11.43 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.57 . Although the best PCE is still not high enough for commercial use , our optimization by designing suitable molecular structures , selecting different solvents and changing other factors could provide useful information for further studies of the commercialized PSCs .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
