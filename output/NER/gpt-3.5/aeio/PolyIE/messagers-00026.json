Linear plot of I ds 1 / 2 vs V gs deduced from the I ds vs V gs measurement . These devices show characteristics of a typical p - channel transistor with good drain - current Modulation , well - defined linear , and saturation regions (Figure 2) . The summary of the performances is provided in Table 1 . I ds = (W / 2L) × μ × C i (V gs - V th) The OFET device using as - cast PCDTBT films without thermal annealing exhibits a hole mobility of 2.2 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 / V ° s with an on / off current ratio (I on / I off) of 4.44 × 10 ^ 3 . For PCDTBT thin films after annealing at evaluated temperatures , the mobilities are not markedly improved , implying that the PCDTBT thin films remain nearly amorphous for both as - cast and annealing at high temperature . On the other hand , it is found that the unannealed thin films of PCDSeBT exhibit a slightly higher mobility of μ h = 5.1 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 / V ° s , compared with that of pristine PCDTBT . Interestingly , in contrast , as the PCDSeBT thin films are annealed at a temperature of 120 and 150 ° C , the mobilities are systematically improved up to 1.0 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 / V ° s (Figure 2b) , which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of PCDTBT , possibly due to increased interpolymer chain contact induced by Se ° ° ° Se interactions with the thermal annealing process . To gain a better understanding of the influence of the thermal annealing , the crystallinity and molecular organization of PCDTBT and PCDSeBT thin films were investigated by Xray diffraction (XRD) , both before and after annealing at 150 ° C . Both the as - cast and annealed PCDTBT thin films fail to reveal any defined scattering patterns (Figure 3a) , indicating the macroscopically disordered , amorphous structure . In the case of PCDSeBT , the as - cast thin films show very weak diffractions (Figure 3b) . Upon thermal annealing , the primary peak at 4.42 ° , corresponding to a d - spacing of 19.99 Å , progressively intensifies and the secondary broad peak at ∼ 21.1 ° (d = 4.21 Å) that is probably related to π - π stacking becomes visible (Figure 3b) . On the basis of these XRD results , we can conclude that the oriented microstructure of the as - cast PCDSeBT thin films is kinetically limited but the polymer chains reorganize to ordered lamellar packing structures upon annealing . This observation is a plausible explanation for the sudden rise in mobility of PCDSeBT as a function of the thermal annealing .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
