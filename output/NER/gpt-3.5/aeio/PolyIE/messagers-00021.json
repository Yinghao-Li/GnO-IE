The less balanced carrier transport in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film accounts for the lower FF . The polymers and polymer blend films were also analyzed by X - ray diffraction (XRD) studies . Figure 8 shows the XRD patterns of the polymers and the polymer : PC 70 BM blends . All film XRD results were similar and showed weak crystalline features with a broad peak around 23 ° . The crystalline features corresponding to π - stacking among the conjugated polymer backbones were also observed among TT - based polymers ; 25 however , the peaks were broader , and no crystalline peaks were observed at smaller angles around 4.4 ° . This less crystalline feature was possibly caused by the more twisted polymer backbones , as compared to PTB7 or PBDTTPD polymer backbones . In conclusion , we synthesized the low band gap POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers that consist of dialkoxybenzodithiophene (BDT) as the donor and N - octyl-2,7 - dithia-5azacyclopenta[a]pentalene-4,6 - dione (DTPD) as the acceptor . The DTPD acceptor moieties allow the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers to have a low band gap (∼ 900 nm) and optimal HOMO and LUMO levels alignment for PSCs , yielding the PCEs of 4.7 and 5.3 % , respectively . In this study , we demonstrate , for the first time , that the DTPD unit is a promising electron - withdrawing building block for low band gap polymers , and it can be utilized to tailor the optical and electronic properties of conjugated polymers for photovoltaic devices and many other applications in plastic electronics .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
