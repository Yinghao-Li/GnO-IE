The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference of the HOMO energy levels and optical band gaps according to the equation : LUMO = (HOMO + E opt g) eV , which lies in the range of -3.79 ∼ -3.88 eV. The electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1 . All polymers showed very deep HOMO levels of ca . -5.5 eV , which were much lower than the reported benzodithiophene - NT (PBDT - DTNT) based poly- mers , 20 illustrating that IDT was a good donor unit that can offer deep HOMO level and high V oc of the PSCs based on the target polymers can be anticipated . Mobility . Hole mobility of donor polymers played an important role in the OPV performance of the resulting PSCs . 53 In order to evaluate the hole mobility of the resulting polymers , corresponding hole - only devices with configuration o f I T O / p o l y (3 , 4 -e t h y l e n e d i o x y t h i o p h e n e) : p o l y -(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT : PSS) / polymer / MoO 3 / Al were fabricated and the hole mobilities were obtained by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model . The calculated hole mobilities of PIDT - EHNT , PIDT - DTNT , and PIDT - C12NT were 9.84 × 10 ^ -5 , 1.66 × 10 ^ -4 , and 2.42 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively . When considering that PIDT - C12NT shows higher hole mobility and superior absorption to that of PIDT - EHNT and PIDT - DTNT , it is rational to envisage that PIDT - C12NT would achieve superior processability and backbone planarity among three polymers . Morphology . Insight into the nanoscale surface topography of the polymer : PC71BM blend films with weight ratio of 1 : 2 were carried out by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) . As can be seen in Figure 5 , blend films based on PIDT - EHNT and PIDT - DTNT with PC71BM showed unexpected phase separation , with corresponding domain size over 200 and 100 nm , respectively which are much larger than typical exciton diffusion length of ca . 10 nm . 54,55 In contrast , PIDT - C12NT based blend film displayed an interpenetrating bicontinuous network between polymer and PC71BM with optimal domain size of 10 - 20 nm that is pretty favorable for efficient diffusion of excitons to donor - acceptor interface .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
