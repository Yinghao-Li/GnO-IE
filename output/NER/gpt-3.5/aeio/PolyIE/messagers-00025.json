The electrochemical properties of PCDSeBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) . As shown in Figure 1b , PCDSeBT exhibits clear reversible n - doping / dedoping processes in the negative potential range , whereas quasi - reversible p - doping / dedoping behaviors in the positive potential range are observed . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be -5.40 eV and -3.70 eV , respectively , using the ferrocene - ferrocenium (Fc / Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) . Both PCDTBT and PCDSeBT have nearly identical HOMO energy levels , but PCDSeBT exhibits 0.10 eV lower - lying LUMO level relative to PCDTBT (LUMO = -3.60 eV , see also Supporting Information) , 5a verifying our presumption aforementioned about the effect of selenium on the selective fine - tuning of LUMO level . The material - design rules described by Scharber et al . 19 suggested that the PCEs of a BHJ solar cell should be much more sensitive to changes of the donor LUMO level compared to variations of the donor bandgap . On the basis of the rules , the estimated PCE from the E g opt and the LUMO value of PCDSeBT is 7.8 % . This theoretical value is much higher than that of PCDTBT (6.5 %) , indicating that a highly promising material for PSCs considering the frontier orbital energies . Upon utilizing a model dimeric system containing methyl groups , the optimized molecular geometry of PCDSeBT and its frontier molecular orbitals of the calculated HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces were computed by density functional theory (DFT , B3LYP / 6 - 31 G) (Figure 1d) . The HOMO of PCDSeBT is well - distributed along the conjugated chains ; its LUMO is mainly centralized on BT accepting core as shaped by orbital lobes , being predicted a p - type organic semiconductor . In order to corroborate the effect of the heteroatom substitution on charge transporting properties of the polymers , top - contact organic field - effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated using solution processed PCDTBT and PCDSeBT , respectively , as the semiconducting layer on the octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self - assembled monolayer (SAM)-modified Si / SiO 2 substrates (see the detailed devices fabrication in the Experimental Section) .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
