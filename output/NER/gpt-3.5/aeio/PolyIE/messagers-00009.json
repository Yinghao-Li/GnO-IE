Smaller domain sizes in the active blend layer could afford a short exciton diffusion length , which is desirable to suppress the recombination loss . 44 The active layer morphologies recorded are in good accordance with the J sc performance of the PffBBn : PC71BM - based devices . Consistent with the observed homogeneous donor : acceptor network with the smallest rms roughness , the PffBB-14 - based device exhibited the highest J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 and FF of 64.36 % , suggesting efficient charge dissociation and transport . In short , AFM results confirm that the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend layer exhibited a desirable morphology for efficient photovoltaic properties . Our results also indicated that the extremely strong aggregation strength of the donor polymer would hinder for the formation of a desirable homogeneous donor / acceptor interpenetration network for efficient photovoltaic performance . We have developed a new series of donor - acceptor copolymer derived from 4,5 - bis((2 - ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b′]dithiophene and dialkyl - substituted difluorinated 4,7 - di-(thiophen-2 - yl)benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole units , such as PffBB - n (n = 10 , 12 , 14 , and 16) as a low band gap donor material for the application of highly efficient BHJ PSCs . PffBB - n exhibited intriguing strong and controllable aggrega - tion behavior , which can be modulated by the size of the alkyl side chain attached on the polymer backbone , processing temperature and solvent used . Because of the strong aggregation behavior , the absorption cut - off of the polymer thin films could extend to ∼ 780 nm , giving rise to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Taking advantage of the temperature - dependent aggregation effect , BHJ PSCs with PffBB - n : PC71BM as an active blend layer spin - coated at different temperatures were fabricated and investigated which showed considerably various photovoltaic performance . Among PSCs fabricated , the PffBB-14 : PC71BM - based device with an active blend layer spin - coated at 80 ° C , showed the best photovoltaic performance with the highest PCE of 9.93 % , a large V oc of 0.92 V , a highest J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36 % . Such an excellent device performance was attributed to the strong and aggregation - broadened absorption , superior exciton dissociation , desirable film morphology , better balanced charge carrier mobilities , and minimal recombination loss . Our results demonstrated that the side chain length modification and processing temperature modulation were proved to be useful for tuning polymer interchain interactions , absorption properties , active layer morphology , and charge carrier properties , thus optimizing the ultimate device performance of BHJ PSCs . Instrumentation . A Bruker - 400 NMR spectrometer was employed to record 1H NMR and 13\n\nLet's think step by step."},
