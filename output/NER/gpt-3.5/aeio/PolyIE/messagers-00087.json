In DCM solution , PBDT - TDPP - S shows two obvious absorption peaks . The first one at ∼ 420 nm corresponds to the π - π * transition of the polymeric backbone in short wavelength region . The second one at ∼ 590 nm in long wavelength region is attributed to the ICT interaction between the donor unit in the main chain and the acceptor unit at the side chain . Compared with the absorption spectrum in DCM solution , the one in solid film displayed a red - shift absorption peak at 602 nm and an additional shoulder at 655 nm besides the highenergy peak . The extended absorption edge in long wavelength region can be attributed to the more aggregated configuration formed in solid state . Compared to the main - chain copolymer of PBDTDPP - OR reported by the Jo group , this side - chain copolymer of PBDT - TDPP - S exhibited a 100 nm blue - shifted maximum absorption peak . The observed blue - shifted absorption phenomenon should be related to the less planar conformation and weaker D - A interaction for the side - chain D - A copolymer than the main - chain D - A copolymer . As a result , the optical band gap (E g opt) of PBDT - TDPP - S was shifted to 1.73 eV as calculated from the onset of absorption spectra in the solid film . 2.3 . Electrochemical Properties . The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of the PBDT - TDPP - S film coated on a platinum electrode is shown in Figure S3 (see Supporting Information) , and the electrochemical data are also summarized in Table 2 . An onset oxidation potential of 0.94 V and an onset reduction potential of -0.88 V (vs SCE) are observed . Based on an empirical formula , the corresponding HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (E HOMO and E LUMO) of PBDT - TDPP - S were calculated to be -5.34 and -3.52 eV , respectively . This resulting E HOMO level is lower than those of the reported mainchain D - A copolymers of PDPP - BDT (-5.16 eV) and PBDTPP - OR (-5.29 eV) . 8 The relatively low E HOMO for PBDT - TDPP - S is beneficial to achieve high V OC in PSCs , given the strong correlation between the V OC and the difference between the E HOMO of donor and the E LUMO of acceptor in PSCs . 8 2.4 . Photovoltaic Properties . The photovoltaic properties of the PBDT - TDPP - S were studied in PSCs using PC61BM or PC71BM as an acceptor . The device configuration was ITO / PEDOT : PSS (30 nm) / polymer : acceptor (80 nm) / LiF(0.7 nm) / Al(100 nm) . The effective device area was 7 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 , as defined by a shadow mask .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
