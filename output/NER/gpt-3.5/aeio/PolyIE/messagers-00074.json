Analogous event has also been realized in D - A type of oligomers and polymers based on 3,4bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)thiophene or 2 - ethylhexyloxy - substituted 3,4 - propylenedioxythiophene as donor and BT as acceptor , which demonstrated that with the depleting composition of BT unit along the conjugated backbone , the dual absorbing bands were induced to move toward the maximum absorption (λ max) of the all - donor homopolymer that located in between of the dual absorbance . 52 In solid state , all polymers showed red - shifted absorption spectra compare to their solution absorption (Figure 2b) , which could be ascribed to the aggregation of polymer main chain . We realized a slightly bathochromic shift of the PIDT - DTNT absorbance relative to that of the PIDT - EHNT , which was in consistent with the trend realized in solution , while PIDT - C12NT showed a pronounced bathochromic shift of the low energy band absorption with λ max moved from 593 nm in solution to 619 nm as thin film . It was also worth noting that PIDT - C12NT showed much higher absorption coefficient than other two polymers in the whole visible area . Considering that high photo flux of solar spectrum within the region of about 550 - 700 nm , more intensified absorption of PIDT - C12NT indicated that more sunlight can be harvested that would potentially lead to higher J sc than the other two polymers . The optical band gaps of the polymers are in the range of 1.64 - 1.69 eV as estimated from the absorption onset and the detailed results are summarized in Table 1 . Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out to evaluate the molecular frontier orbitals of the resulted polymers . The graphite , platinum wire , and Ag / AgCl were used as the working electrode , counter electrode , and reference electrode , respectively . Polymer films were casted from chlorobenzene solution with concentration of 8 mg mL -1 and all measurements were carried out under inert atmosphere . Figure 3 showed the oxidation of cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films on graphite disk electrode in tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu 4 NPF 6) solution (0.1 M in acetonitrile) at a scan rate of 50 mV s^-1 .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
