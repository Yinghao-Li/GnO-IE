The incorporation of an extended fused aromatic unit in the polymer backbone is expected to induce strong intermolecular interactions (π - π stacking) , affording high crystallinity to the polymer and thus resulting in a reduced energy barrier for charge carrier transport . Therefore , the DPP - based copolymers combined with fused heteroarenes have shown low band - gaps with excellent charge transport characteristics and thus a high short circuit current density (J SC) of the solar cell device . [26][27][28][29] However , since low band - gap DPP - based copolymers usually exhibit a relatively high - lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level , leading to a low open circuit voltage (V OC) of PSCs , a compromise between the band - gap and the HOMO energy level of DPP - based polymers is critically required . One way to solve the trade - off between V OC and J SC of the PSC based on low band - gap polymers is to introduce arene groups which have weak electron - donating power . When a benzene or naphthalene group which has a weak electrondonating nature was incorporated into DPP - based copolymers , a low - lying HOMO energy level was achieved without a large sacrifice of the band - gap , and as a result PCEs were improved with enhanced V OC s as compared to the counterpart polymer with a strong electron - donating unit . 30,31 Anthracene is also an interesting building block as an electron - donating unit for low band - gap conjugated polymers , because the electron - donating power of anthracene is relatively weaker than fused heteroarenes such as thieno [3,2 - b]thiophene and dithieno[3,2 - b:2′,3′-d]thiophene , and therefore , anthracene - based copolymers are expected to have a low - lying HOMO energy level . Furthermore , anthracene - based copolymers usually exhibit high crystallinity and high charge carrier mobility due to the coplanar fused structure of the anthracene unit . Therefore , a combination of DPP and anthracene could be ideal , thus leading to high J SC and V OC . Nevertheless , a few studies have reported that anthracene - DPP conjugated polymers show low PCEs less than 3 % . 32 Here , we synthesized low band - gap copolymers incorporating 9,10 - bis (5-(2 - ethylhexyl)thiophen-2 - yl)anthracene (TA) and DPP as an electron - donating and electron - withdrawing unit , respectively . Very recently , we have successfully demonstrated that TA is a promising electron - donating moiety of medium band - gap conjugated copolymers for high performance polymer solar cells . 33 In conjunction with its weak electrondonating characteristics , TA possesses an extended conjugation in 2 - D , which is expected to enhance the light absorption and self - assembly of the resulting copolymer .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
