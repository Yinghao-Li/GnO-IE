The results suggested that all polymers exhibited good thermal stability with Tdhigher than 350 ° C (Table 1) , indicating that these polymers are feasible for high - temperature device a Molecular weight of polymers determined by gel permeation chromatography , using polystyrene as the reference standard , 1,2,3trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 ° C (flow rate : 1 mL min -1 ; column set : 3 × PLgel Olexix 300 × 7.5 mm) . b The polydispersity index was calculated from : PDI = M w / M n . c Estimated from thermal gravimetric analysis with a ramp rate of 40 ° C min -1 . Article fabrication . The physical properties of PffBB - n polymers are summarized in Table 1 . Detailed synthetic procedures and TGA traces could be found in the Supporting Information (SI) . Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Polymers . The UV - vis absorption spectra of PffBB - n (n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16) measured in chlorobenzene at different temperatures and in thin films are shown in Figure 1 . It is clearly demonstrated that PffBB - n exhibits strong temperature - dependent aggregation behavior . In thin films , PffBB - n showed three major absorption bands with the high - energy absorption peaked at ∼ 430 nm and two overlapped and strong absorptions peaked at ∼ 620 and 680 nm . In solution , the first two absorption peaks blue - shift to 380 - 420 and 520 - 560 nm , respectively , and the third absorption is highly temperature - dependent which becomes a shoulder peak at high temperature . Therefore , the absorption band located in the high energy region was attributed to π - π * transitions , whereas the broad absorption at around 560 nm corresponded to the intramolecular charge transfer band and the long - wavelength absorption emerged at ∼ 680 nm was due to the polymer interchain stacking aggregation . This aggregation - induced absorption is temperature - sensitive in which the absorption decreases with the increase of temperature , resulting from polymer chain segregation at high temperature . The incorporation of an alkyl side chain can often render a better solubility of a polymer ; however , the long alkyl side chain can exert stronger alkyl - alkyl chain interactions that can give rise to a strong aggregation of polymer chains . As shown in Figure 1 , the aggregation ability / strength of PffBB - n polymers also enhanced with an increase in the size of the alkyl side chains (from n = 10 to 16) . Furthermore , this class of polymers exhibited solvent - dependent aggregation behavior in which chloroform and toluene often induced stronger aggregation ; on the other hand , chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene induced moderate aggregation (Figure S3) .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
