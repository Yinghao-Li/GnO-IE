Here , the atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to investigate the morphology of the blend film of the polymer : PC 70 BM fabricated from CB and DCB solutions , respectively , as shown in Fig . 3 . For PDTP - BT : PC 70 BM , both CB and DCB gave the films with obvious phase separation with a root mean square (RMS) of 2.222 nm and 0.880 nm , respectively , which might be due to the poor miscibility of the two materials . For PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT , the blend film of polymer / PC 70 BM spin - coated from CB was also rough , but the blend films fabricated from DCB displayed a much smoother surface with a RMS of 0.188 nm and 0.259 nm , respectively . This smaller roughness of the blend film indicates that the domain size of the phase separation of the donor - acceptor interpenetrating network could be reduced , which could be beneficial for the exciton charge separation and charge transport . These results indicate that the morphologies of these polymers with PC 70 BM are quite sensitive to the solvents used for device processing and the introduction of a thienyl spacer could improve the miscibility . The photovoltaic properties of the three copolymers PDTP - BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT were studied by fabricating bulk heterojunction BHJ - type PSCs with a conventional sandwich configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC 70 BM / Ca / Al . The effective areas of the PSCs , contributing to photocurrent , were defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light . The devices were optimized by changing many factors , such as the ratio of the donor and the acceptor , the thickness of blend films and the cathode metal . The best performance was obtained with the thickness of the active layer of 80 - 90 nm , the copolymers : PC 70 BM ratio of 1 : 2 (by weight) and the Ca / Al used as the cathode . Fig . 4 shows the J - V curves of the optimized PSCs based on the three polymers under illumination of AM 1.5 simulated solar light (100 mW cm^-2) . The PSCs with two kinds of solvents CB and DCB for the spin - coating of the active layers were investigated , and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices open - circuit voltage (V OC) , short - circuit current density (J SC) , fill factor (FF) and PCE are summarized in Table 2 . When CB was used as the solvent , all the combinations showed a relatively low PCE of 0.87 % , 1.97 % and 1.92 % in the devices with PDTP - BT : PC 70 BM , PDTP - DTBT : PC 70 BM and PDTP - DT2BT : PC 70 BM respectively .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
