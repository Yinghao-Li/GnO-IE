These results suggest that on the absorption of the polymers , both absorption peaks and absorption coefficients could be readily controlled by tailoring the number of thienyl spacers along the polymers . 37,39,40 The absorption edge shifts from ca . 900 nm in PDTP - BT to ca . 850 nm in PDTP - DTBT and ca . 750 nm in PDTP - DT2BT , reflecting the broadening of the optical band - gap in sequence . Table 1 shows the optical band - gaps (E opt g) of all polymers estimated from the corresponding UV - vis absorption onset . PDTP - DT2BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - BT have optical band gaps of 1.61 , 1.46 and 1.41 eV , respectively , which are close to the ideal value of 1.5 eV for PSC application . These changes of the absorption spectra upon the introduction of thienyl groups can be qualitatively understood from density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the corresponding model compounds (Fig . S1 †) . The optimized structures show that all the polymer backbones are mostly planar . Time dependent DFT calculations show that the absorption band in the longer wavelength is mainly attributed to the transition from HOMO delocalized in the D - A backbone to LUMO localized in DTP units for all the polymers . On the other hand , the absorption in the shorter wavelength is largely contributed by the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1 , which is similar to π - π * transition in polythiophene judging by the shape of the orbitals . Therefore , the introduction of more thienyl spacer could stabilize LUMO+1 (π *) due to the better conjugation , resulting in the red - shift of the absorption band . At the same time , it could decrease the D - A nature of the polymer due to the weaker electron acceptability of DTP , resulting in the blueshift of the charge transfer bands . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the polymers and estimate the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers . Representative cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of these copolymers are shown in Fig . 2 Crystalline order of the copolymer thin films was investigated by X - ray diffraction (XRD) scans (Fig . S2 †) . In the out - of - plane measurement , the XRD pattern of PDTP - BT reveals a weak peak near 6 ° , and there is no clear peak for PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT , suggesting that they exhibit amorphous structures in the film , which might be due to the bulky side chain in the DTP building block . A change in the number of thienyl spacers in this system does not significantly affect the aggregation behaviour of the polymer main chains .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
