The PQCDTB dissolved in general organic solvents , and the M n was 49.8 kg / mol . The optical band gap energy was 1.92 eV , which was similar to the band gap of benzothiadiazole . The HOMO and LUMO levels of PQCDTB were -5.24 eV and -3.32 eV , respectively . According to the XRD measurement , PQCDTB showed the formation of ordered lamellar structure as an out - of - plane peak (h00) by the alkyl side chain of quinacridone and conventional edge - on πstacking . This study also evaluated the OPV characteristics by fabricating a bulk - heterojunction - type polymer solar cell . When PQCDTB and PC71BM were fabricated in a 1 : 1 weight ratio , the open - circuit voltage (V OC) , short - circuit current (J SC) , fill factor (FF) , and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8 % and 2.5 % , respectively . In particular , PQCDTB exhibited higher FFs compared with poly[carbazole - alt - benzothiadiazole] (PCZDTB) . For the past several decades , semiconducting polymers have been applied to various sectors , such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) , 1 - 4 organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) 5 - 9 and organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) . 10 - 13 Of these applications , OPVs have become mainstream , thanks to their outstanding economic feasibility and sustainable development . Nevertheless , a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been the largest obstacle in OPVs . 6 To improve the PCE , the following idealistic conditions are required in conjugated polymers : 14 (1) a low bandgap with a wide absorption area , (2) a crystalline structure to produce good charge transport characteristics , (3) a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to produce a high open - circuit voltage (V oc) , and (4) an appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level for effective electron charge transfer to fullerene . To acquire good charge transport characteristics , it is necessary to increase the close packing among polymers through the reduction of energetic disorder by increasing the coplanarity and the interchain π - π interaction . In the Janssen group , a copolymer containing terthiophene was reported , which shows an increase in planarity packing and high mobility characteristics , and a diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative showed a PCE of 4.7 % and a high hole mobility (0.04 cm^2 V -1 S^-1) . 15 In the Jen group , a hole mobility of 0.029 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 and a PCE of 6.2 % were reported in a copolymer that contained an indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit and a phenanthrenequinoxaline unit .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
