The newly developed DTPD moiety was carefully designed to lower a band gap via strong interaction between donor - acceptor moieties and keep polymer energy levels deep . Remarkably , the DTPD acceptor moiety effectively widens the light absorption range of the polymers up to ∼ 900 nm while positioning their HOMO and LUMO levels in the optimal range , i.e. , -5.3 and -4.0 eV , respectively , for high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as we intended . Solar cell devices were fabricated according to the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / photoactive (polymer : PC 70 BM) / TiO 2 / Al . The POBDTPD devices exhibited a PCE of 4.7 % with a V oc of 0.70 V , a J sc of 10.6 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.64 . The PEBDTPD devices yielded a higher PCE of 5.3 % with a V oc of 0.72 V , a J sc of 13.5 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.54 . AFM , TEM , and PL quenching measurements revealed that the high J sc s are a result of the appropriate morphology and efficient charge separation . In comparing the performances of the two polymer devices , the higher J sc for the PEBDTPD device was attributed to its better nanoscale phase separation , smoother surface , and higher carrier mobility in the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films . The higher FF for the POBDTPD device was ascribed to a good balance between the hole and electron mobilities . Overall , we demonstrate that the DTPD unit is a promising electron - accepting moiety to develop high performance low band gap polymers . Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention for their potential utility in the production of large - area , low - cost , and flexible photovoltaic devices via solution processing . 1 - 4 To achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) , electrondonor polymers should have the following desirable characteristics : (i) good absorption spectral overlap with the solar spectrum , (ii) optimal energy level alignment with respect to electron - acceptor fullerene derivatives (typically [6,6]-phenyl - C61 - butyric acid methyl ester (PC 60 BM) or [6,6]-phenyl - C71butyric acid methyl ester (PC 70 BM) ) to facilitate efficient exciton separation , (iii) formation of a nanoscale interpenetrating network of the polymer and fullerene domains inside the photoactive layer , and (iv) provision of effective charge transport carriers toward the electrodes . To meet these requirements , intensive research efforts have been focused on integrating electron - rich donor units and electron - deficient acceptor units into a single conjugated polymeric system .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
