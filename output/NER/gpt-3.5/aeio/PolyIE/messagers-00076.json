As film morphology plays a critical role in charge transport , the smoother blend film based on PIDT - C12NT that present more favorable morphological features , may effectively reduce charge recombination and traps , and thereby potentially lead to higher J sc and fill factor (FF) than the other two polymers . Photovoltaic Properties . The photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers were investigated with a conventional device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS (40 nm) / polym e r : P C 7 ^ 1 B M (8 ^ 0 n m) / p o l y [(9 , 9 -b i s (3 â€² - (N , Ndimethylamino)propyl)-2,7 - fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9 - dioctylfluorene) ] (PFN) (5 nm) / Al (100 nm) , here a thin layer of PFN was employed as the cathode interlayer since it can improve the electron extraction . 56 - 58 We chose PC71BM as the acceptor because it had much stronger absorption in the visible region than PC61BM , which can complement the absorption valley of the polymers and beneficial for high - efficiency PSCs . 59 The BHJ photoactive layer was prepared by spin - coating chlorobenzene solution of the polymer : PC71BM with weight ratio of 1 : 2 on the top of PEDOT : PSS layer without further treatment . The tests were performed under the illumination of AM 1.5 G , 100 mW cm^-2 with an active of area of 0.16 cm^2 . The J - V characteristics are shown in Figure 6a and the parameters of J sc , V oc , FF and PCE of the resulting PSCs are summarized in Table 2 . It was found that all PSC devices based on these polymers demonstrated relative high V oc of ca . 0.8 - 0.9 V , which benefited from the deep HOMO levels . Device based on PIDT - EHNT obtained a low PCE of 1.49 % , with a J sc of 4.33 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.86 V and a FF of 40 % . Slightly improved device performance was realized based on PIDT - DTNT , which exhibited a V oc of 0.80 V , a FF of 45 % , but a dramatically improved J sc of 8.26 mA cm^-2 , leading to a moderate PCE of 2.97 % . Best device performance with a PCE of 5.05 % was achieved based on PIDT - C12NT , which showed further improved J sc of 10.21 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.90 V and a FF of 55 % .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
