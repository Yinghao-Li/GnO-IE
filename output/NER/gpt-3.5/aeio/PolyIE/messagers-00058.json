The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / LiF / Al , where the polymers (P1- P7) were used as electron donors and PC71BM (or PC61BM) was used as an electron acceptor . To optimize the morphology and ordering structure , different volume percentages of 1,8diiodooctane were added . 43 Figure 4 shows the current density versus voltage (J - V) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW / cm^2 . The V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE values of the PSC devices are summarized in Table 3 . From P1 to P4 , PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor , but for P5 , P6 , and P7 , PC61BM was used as the electron acceptor . P5 , P6 , and P7 blended with PC61BM showed higher PCE values than when they were blended with PC71BM in spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , which is most likely due to the lower miscibility of those polymers with PC71BM . 44 The V OC of these random terpolymers increased in the order P2 (0.74 V) âˆ¼ P3 (0.74 V) < P4 (0.76 V) < P5 (0.79 V) < P6 (0.82 V) . The trend in the V OC of the PSCs can be explained by the HOMO energy level of the polymers because the V OC is typically linearly proportional to the difference in energy between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor . 45 However , the PCE of the random terpolymers showed a the nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % in the order P3 (5.61 %) > P4 (5.26 %) > P2 (4.91 %) > P5 (3.02 %) > P6 (2.09 %) ; this was consistent with the observed trend of the J SC . P3 exhibited the highest PCE value of 5.61 % among all polymers , including P1 and P7 , which was attributed to the broad absorption and increased V OC due to the deeper HOMO energy level .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
