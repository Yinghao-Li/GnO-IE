  {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"['Material Name', 'Property Name of Material', 'Value of Material Property']\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 8 The photocurrent response of all of these polymers extends to a wavelength of 1 μm ; however , the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these PSCs in the wavelength range between 650 and 1100 nm is typically less than 10 % , which results in low overall PCEs under AM1.5 simulated solar light . Up to now , the highest PCE of μmR - polymer was just 1.1 % , based on poly(di-2 - thienylthienopyrazine) by using complicated doubled active layers photovoltaic devices . 7 The fundamental requirements for promising photovoltaic μmR - polymers include the following : (a) broad absorption extending to or surpassing 1 μm to absorb more sunlight ; (b) a high LUMO energy level to allow effective photoinduced charge transfer from the polymers to the acceptor in the BHJ device and at the same time , a low HOMO level to keep the open circuit voltage (V OC) as high as possible ; (c) high carrier mobility to ensure that effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes suppresses photocurrent loss ; and (d) good solubility and appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives to form high - quality films by solution processing . The lack of successful photovoltaic μmR - polymers might be due to the difficulty of fulfilling all these requirements simultaneously with one polymer . Very recently , 3,6 - dithien-2 - yl-2 , 5 - dialkylpyrrolo[3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione (DTDPP) was shown to be a promising building block for the design of photovoltaic polymers . 9 In our previous work , we also found the polymer , PDTP - DTDPP , based on DTDPP and dithieno[3,2 - b : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -d]pyrrole was one of potential μmRpolymers . The PCE based on this polymer arrived 1.1 % , one of highest value for μmR - polymers . 10 Herein , we present a new donor - acceptor alternative conjugated polymer , changing the alkyl chain in the diketopyrrolopyrrole segment of PDTP - DTDPP from 2 - ethylhexyl to n - butyl . This new polymer , referred to as PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) , is designed to fulfill the abovementioned requirements simultaneously as much as possible . As a result , bulk heterojunction - type polymer solar cells based on PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PC 70 BM have broad photocurrent response wavelength range from 300 nm to 1.1 μm . High shortcircuit current (14.87 mA / cm^2) and PCE (2.71 %) were achieved , which is a significant advance for efficient μmR - polymers . * Corresponding author . E - mail : hashimoto @ light.t.u - tokyo.ac.jp . Material Synthesis . The new polymer PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) was synthesized by coupling 3,6 - di(2 - bromothien-5 - yl)-2 , 5dibutylpyrrolo[3,4 - c] pyrrole-1,4 - dione and 2,6 - di(trimethyl- tin)-N-[1-(2 0 -ethylhexyl)-3 - ethylheptanyl]dithieno[3,2 - b : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -d]- pyrrole via a Stille reaction (Scheme 1) . The polymer has good solubility in CHCl 3 but is only partly soluble in chlorobenzene and o - dichlorobenzene . The number - average molecular weight (M n) of the polymer is 18.9 kg / mol with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.04 . Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plots of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) is shown in Figure 1 .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
