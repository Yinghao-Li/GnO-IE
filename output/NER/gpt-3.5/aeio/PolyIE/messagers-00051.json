  {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"['Material Name', 'Property Name of Material', 'Value of Material Property']\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: However , P2 with thiophene spacer between two large units 8 and BDT has poor solubility due to more planar conformation and stronger interchain interactions caused by smaller torsion angle . To our surprise , P3 with three solubilizing n - alkyl groups also has poor solubility probably due to strong interchain interactions . Replacing n - dodecyl in P3 with 2 - decyltetradecyl group significantly enhance solubility of P4 . P5 and P6 also have good solubility . Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene standards as calibrants . The polymers P1 and P4 - P6 show numberaverage molecular weight (M n) of 12 ^ 250 , 9934 , 5714 , and 10 ^ 053 , with polydispersity indices (M w / M n) of 1.30 , 1.43 , 1.71 , and 1.56 , respectively (Table 1) . The GPC measurements for P2 and P3 are not carried out due to their low solubility . The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen (Figure 2) . The decomposition temperature (T d) at 5 % weight loss for P3 - P6 are above 330 ° C , while P1 and P2 exhibit lower Td(below 300 ° C) (Table 1) . Optical Properties . The UV - vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of P1 - P6 were measured in CHCl 3 (ca . 10 ^ -6 M) solution and in thin films , and the results are red - shifted 88 and 112 nm respectively , relative to monomer 4b (Figure S1 , Supporting Information) due to increased conjugation . Compared to homopolymer P6 , all copolymers P1 - P5 exhibit red - shifted absorptions and smaller optical bandgaps in solution and in film . Broad absorption bands located in the visible region were observed for the solution and film of P1 (Figure 4) . The absorbance maximum for P1 in solution is 496 nm . The absorption spectrum of P1 in film exhibits red - shift and distinct shoulder peak at ca . 540 nm , which are probably related to the formation of molecular aggregates owing to the strong interchain interactions . The absorption maxima of P2 in solution and in film are red - shifted 14 and 32 nm relative to that of P1 , respectively , thanks to its more planar conformation and increased conjugation . P3 and P4 exhibit almost same absorption profile in solution and in film . Compared to P1 and P2 , P3 and P4 exhibit relatively narrow and blue - shifted absorption band in solution and in film . P5 in solution and in film exhibits absorbance maxima at 503 and 524 nm , which are shifted 20 nm to the red relative to those of P4 , suggesting a more planar conformation . The trend in emission spectra of P1 - P6 in solution and in film resembles that in their absorption spectra .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
