On the basis of the above consideration , herein , we designed and synthesized two new D - A copolymers PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO (Scheme 1) based on zNDT flanked with two thiophene units as donor unit and BT or BO as acceptor unit . We introduced two dodecyloxy substituents on BT / BO rings to guarantee good solubility of the polymers . The thermal , photophysical , and optoelectronic properties of the resulting two polymers were systematically investigated . The results showed that both the two polymers exhibit not only high fieldeffect mobilities but also high photovoltaic properties . Synthesis and Thermal Stability . The synthetic routes of monomers and corresponding polymers are outlined in Scheme 1 . Monomer 1 was reacted with n - butyllithium and then with Me 3 SnCl to give compound M 1 in a good yield . Both polymers were synthesized by palladium - catalyzed Stille - coupling polymerization and purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction with methanol , hexanes , and CHCl 3 . The CHCl 3 fraction was then reduced in volume , precipitated into methanol , and collected by filtration , yielding shiny , bronze - colored solids . PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO can be readily dissolved in common solvents , such as chloroform , toluene , and chlorobenzene , and processed to form smooth and pinhole - free films upon spincoating . The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by GPC in THF solution relative to polystyrene standards , and the detailed GPC data are listed in Table 1 .. Both polymers have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures with 5 % weight loss at 313 - 320 ° C . Obviously , the thermal stability of these polymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs , OFETs , and other optoelectronic devices . Optical Properties . , including the absorption peak wavelengths (λ abs) , the absorption edge wavelengths (λ onset) , and the optical band gap (E g opt) . In Figure 3a , both of the absorption spectra recorded from dilute chloroform solutions display π - π * transitions at around 425 nm and large charge transfer features between 500 and 700 nm which are assigned by analogy to similar polymers , corresponding to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the acceptor (BT / BO) and donor (NDT) units .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
