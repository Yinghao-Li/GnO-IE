  {"role": "user", "content": "Please identify the \"['Material Name', 'Property Name of Material', 'Value of Material Property']\" entities in the following paragraph.\n\nParagraph: A novel series of low band gap donor - acceptor copolymers derived from 4,5bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 5,6 - difluoro-4,7 - bis(4 - alkylthien-2 - yl)benzo [c][1,2,5]thiadiazole bearing various alkyl side chains , such as PffBB - n (n = 10 , 12 , 14 , and 16) , were developed for high - performance bulk - heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) . PffBB - n exhibited not only strong and wide absorption but also controllable aggregation behavior in solution and thin films , in which aggregation behavior was greatly influenced by the length of alkyl side chains attached , temperature applied , and solvent used . Aggregation - induced spectral broadening further extended the absorption cutoff to ∼ 780 nm in thin films , leading to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Because of the strong aggregation strength , PffBB - n equipped with long alkyl side chains shows enhanced ordered molecular packing and good crystallinity as revealed by X - ray diffraction studies . In addition , temperature - dependent aggregation of the PffBB - n : PC71BM blend was investigated and optimized in the PSC fabrication . PSCs fabricated with the PffBB - n : PC71BM blend , conducted at 80 ° C optimized coating temperature , showed relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE) ranging from 8.22 to 9.93 % . The well - ordered BHJ film morphology of the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend led to superior balanced charge carrier mobility , good exciton dissociation , and the least recombination loss and hence PffBB-14 - based PSC reached the highest photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 9.93 % , a V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 and , a FF of 64.36 % . Our results demonstrated that the synergetic effect of alkyl side chain modification and processing temperature modulation to control aggregation provides practical and powerful tools to optimize the absorption broadening and optoelectronic properties of an active layer in a BHJ PSC , thus enhancing its ultimate performance . Polymeric materials show promising potential for the applications of future solar cell technology because of their advantages of solution processability , lightweight , cost efficiency , and mechanical flexibility . 1 Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 10 % have been realized during the last decade , which was benefited from tremendous efforts on the development of advanced donor and / or acceptor materials , device engineering and optimized fabrication processes . 2 - 12 Nevertheless , the poor sunlight harvesting efficiency and low charge carrier mobility of organic semiconducting materials still hinder the further efficiency improvement of PSCs . Polythiophene (PT) materials have been proved to be promising donor materials as most PT materials exhibit high regioregularity for easy formation of well - organized active layer morphology , thus providing an auspicious way to develop new and efficient photovoltaic (PV) materials . 13 - 20 However , thiophene - based units are strongly electron - rich in nature , which often give rise to a high - lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
