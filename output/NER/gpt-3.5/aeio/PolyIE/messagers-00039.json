The LUMO energy level of PSFDTBT is positioned about 0.80 eV above that of PC71BM (4.2 eV , measured under the same condition) , which offers enough driving force for charge separation and transfer without too much energy loss . 5,17 Transport Properties . The transport properties of the polymer were investigated by fabricating organic thin film fieldeffect transistors (OFETs) . Typical p - channel field - effect transistor behavior was obtained . The hole mobility (μ) was estimated in the saturated regime from the derivative plots of the square root of source - drain current (I SD) versus gate voltage (V G) through equation 2 where W is the channel width , L is the channel length , C i is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer (SiO 2 , 500 nm , C i = 7.5 nF / cm^2) , and V T is the threshold voltage . The output (a) and transfer characteristics (b) of the spin - coated PSFDTBT films are shown in Figure 2 . The hole mobility of the pristine PSFDTBT film spin - cast from DCB solution is 7.26 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10 ^ 5 , which is almost two orders higher than that of P1 (the hole mobility of pure P1 film is 2 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1) . 8 Such comparable high mobility is beneficial for charge transfer in the resulting PSCs . 5 For the PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend film (in a weight ratio of 1 : 3 , spin - coated from ODCB solutions) , hole mobility (μ hole) of 1.14 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and electron mobility (μ e) of 2.7 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 were obtained . I SD = (W / 2L)C i μ(V G - V T) Photovoltaic Properties . Broad absorption , appropriate HOMO / LUMO positions , and comparable hole mobility make PSFDTBT a promising donor material in BHJ PSCs . Therefore , the photovoltaic performance of PSFDTBT was investigated in PSCs . Polymer solar cells with a device configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al were fabricated and characterized under the illumination of AM1.5 G (100 mW / cm^2) . The weight ratio of PSFDTBT to PC71BM and the processing solvent have been carefully optimized . The results are summarized in Table 1 . Using DCB as the processing solvent , four polymer solar cells with blends of PSFDTBT and PC71BM in weight ratios of 1 : 2.5 , 1 : 3 , 1 : 3.5 , and 1 : 4 , respectively , as the active layer were fabricated , and their J - V curves are shown in Figure 3a . In all cases , PCEs of about 4.1 % were obtained .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
