Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the entities.\n\n1. \"He\" - This refers to a person, so it is a \"Person\" entity.\n\n2. \"anonymous death threats\" - This refers to a type of threat, so it is not a specific entity.\n\n3. \"making the move\" - This phrase does not refer to a specific entity, but rather an action or decision.\n\nTherefore, the identified entities in the paragraph are:\n\n- Person: \"He\""},
