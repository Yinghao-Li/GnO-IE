Here are the valid \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph presented as a Markdown table:\n\n| Disease             |\n|---------------------|\n| cocaine dependence  |\n\nPlease note that \"mania\" was initially mentioned as a symptom of a mental disorder, but since it is not explicitly referred to as a disease in the paragraph, it has been excluded from the table.\n\nNER Response 2: Certainly!

There is no conflict in the identification of \"cocaine dependence\" as a disease entity.\n\n2. There is no conflict in the identification of \"cocaine\" as a chemical entity.\n\n3. However, there is a conflict in the identification of \"diethylpropion (DEP)\" as a chemical entity. The NER result identifies it as a chemical, but it is actually a medication. To resolve this conflict, we can update the NER result to identify \"diethylpropion (DEP)\" as a medication entity instead of a chemical entity.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n| Disease             |\n|---------------------|\n| cocaine dependence  |\n\n| Medication           |\n|----------------------|\n| diethylpropion (DEP) |\n\nWith the conflicts resolved, the updated NER results accurately identify the named entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
