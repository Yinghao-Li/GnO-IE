NER Response 1 identifies it as a disease, while NER Response 2 identifies it as a chemical.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Aminonucleoside nephrosis\" based on the context of the paragraph.\n\nIn the given paragraph, \"Aminonucleoside nephrosis\" is mentioned in the context of rats, mesangial function, and glomerular sclerosis. Based on this context, it is more likely that \"Aminonucleoside nephrosis\" refers to a disease rather than a chemical.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering \"Aminonucleoside nephrosis\" as a disease entity.\n\nResolved NER Response: | Disease                |\n|------------------------|\n| Aminonucleoside nephrosis |"},
