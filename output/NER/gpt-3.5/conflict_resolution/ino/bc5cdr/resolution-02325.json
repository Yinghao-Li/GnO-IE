Based on the paragraph, it is clear that \"methamphetamine\" is being referred to as a diagnosis, not as a chemical. Therefore, the NER Response 2 is correct in identifying \"Methamphetamine\" as a chemical.\n\nHowever, the NER Response 1 incorrectly identifies \"methamphetamine-induced psychosis\" as a disease. In the context of the paragraph, \"methamphetamine-induced psychosis\" should be considered as a condition or a disorder, not a disease.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Disorder                   |\n|---------------------------|\n| methamphetamine-induced psychosis |\n\nNER Response 2: | Chemical       |\n|----------------|\n| Methamphetamine |"},
