NER Response 1 identifies \"Myocardial contrast enhancement\" as a disease, while NER Response 2 identifies it as a chemical.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Myocardial contrast enhancement\" based on the context provided in the paragraph.\n\nIn this case, since the phrase \"Myocardial contrast enhancement\" is mentioned in relation to \"elevations in cTnI,\" it is more likely that \"Myocardial contrast enhancement\" refers to a medical procedure or imaging technique rather than a disease or a chemical.\n\nTherefore, the correct entity type for \"Myocardial contrast enhancement\" is likely to be a medical procedure or imaging technique.\n\nResolved NER Result: | Medical Procedure/Imaging Technique |\n|---------------------------------|\n| Myocardial contrast enhancement |"},
