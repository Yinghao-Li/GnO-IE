NER Response 1 identifies \"FSGS\" as a disease, while NER Response 2 identifies it as a chemical.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for the term \"FSGS\" based on the context provided in the paragraph.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the context.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the term \"FSGS\" is mentioned in the context of glomeruli showing changes of progressive FSGS. Based on this context, it is more likely that \"FSGS\" refers to a disease rather than a chemical.\n\nStep 4: Resolve the conflicts based on the context.\n\nBased on the context analysis, we can conclude that the correct entity type for \"FSGS\" is a disease.\n\nResolved NER Results: | Disease |\n|---------|\n| FSGS    |"},
