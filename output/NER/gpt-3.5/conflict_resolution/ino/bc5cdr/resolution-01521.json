This is a conflict.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nBased on the context of the paragraph, \"cortical dysplasia\" is being referred to as a malformation, which suggests it is a disease rather than a chemical entity. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering NER Response 1 as the correct identification.\n\nResolved NER Response: \n| Disease           |\n|-------------------|\n| cortical dysplasia |"},
