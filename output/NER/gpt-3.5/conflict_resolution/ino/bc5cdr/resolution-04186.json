Conflict 1: The first NER response identifies \"Quinine toxicity\" as a \"Disease\" entity, while the second NER response identifies it as a \"Chemical\" entity. \n\nResolution: The correct entity type for \"Quinine toxicity\" in this context is \"Disease\" since it refers to the toxic effects of quinine. Therefore, the second NER response should be updated to classify \"Quinine\" as a \"Chemical\" entity, and \"Quinine toxicity\" as a \"Disease\" entity.\n\n2. Conflict 2: The first NER response does not identify any other named entities, while the second NER response does not provide any additional information.\n\nResolution: Both NER responses should be updated to include other relevant named entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"transient tonic pupillary response,\" \"denervation supersensitivity,\" and \"abnormal visual-evoked potentials.\" The correct entity types for these entities would depend on the context and domain knowledge."},
