In NER Response 1, \"Acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure\" is identified as a disease. However, in NER Response 2, \"Acetaminophen\" is identified as a chemical entity.\n\nTo resolve this conflict, we can consider \"Acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure\" as a disease, as mentioned in NER Response 1. Therefore, the correct named entity type for \"Acetaminophen\" should be \"Disease\" instead of \"Chemical\" as mentioned in NER Response 2.\n\nThe resolved NER results would be:\n\nNER Response 1: \n| Disease                           |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| Acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure |\n\nNER Response 2: \n| Disease                           |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| Acetaminophen |"},
