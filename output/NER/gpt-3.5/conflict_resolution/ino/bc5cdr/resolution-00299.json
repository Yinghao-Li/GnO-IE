Therefore, NER Response 2, which identifies \"Cocaine\" as a chemical, is the more accurate identification. \n\nResolved NER Results: \nNER Response 1: | Disease                |\n|------------------------|\n| Prenatal cocaine exposure |\n\nNER Response 2: | Chemical |\n|----------|\n| Cocaine  |"},
