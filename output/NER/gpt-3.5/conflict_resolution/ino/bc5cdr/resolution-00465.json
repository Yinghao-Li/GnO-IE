NER Response 1 identifies it as a disease, while NER Response 2 identifies it as a chemical.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct identification of the named entity \"sterile leukocyturia\" based on the context of the paragraph.\n\nIn the given paragraph, \"sterile leukocyturia\" is described as a condition with a cumulative incidence. It is not mentioned as a chemical or a disease. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider \"sterile leukocyturia\" as a medical condition or a symptom rather than a chemical or a disease.\n\nStep 3: Update the NER results.\n\nBased on the context, the correct identification of the named entity \"sterile leukocyturia\" is as a medical condition or symptom.\n\nUpdated NER Response: | Medical Condition |\n|------------------|\n| sterile leukocyturia |"},
