NER Response 1 identifies \"PDN\" as a disease, while NER Response 2 identifies it as a chemical.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"PDN\" based on the context provided in the paragraph.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there is no indication that \"PDN\" refers to a disease. However, it is mentioned in the context of \"subacute exposure,\" which suggests that \"PDN\" is likely a chemical or a substance.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that NER Response 2 is more accurate, and \"PDN\" should be classified as a chemical.\n\nResolved NER Results: | Chemical |\n|----------|\n| PDN      |"},
