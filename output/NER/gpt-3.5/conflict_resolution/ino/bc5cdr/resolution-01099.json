This is a conflict because \"Vancomycin\" is a drug, not a disease.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity.\" Based on the context of the paragraph, it is clear that \"Vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity\" refers to a disease or condition caused by the drug Vancomycin. Therefore, the correct entity type for \"Vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity\" is a disease.\n\nStep 3: Update the NER results.\n\nNER Response 1 is correct in identifying \"Vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity\" as a disease entity.\n\nNER Response 2 is correct in identifying \"Vancomycin\" as a chemical entity.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Disease                      |\n|------------------------------|\n| Vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity |\n\nNER Response 2: | Chemical       |\n|----------------|\n| Vancomycin     |\n| Erdosteine     |"},
