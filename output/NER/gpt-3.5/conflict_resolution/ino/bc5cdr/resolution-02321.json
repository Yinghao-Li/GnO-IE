This suggests that \"Methamphetamine\" is being used as a chemical substance rather than a disease.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering NER Response 2 as the correct entity type for \"Methamphetamine\" and disregarding NER Response 1.\n\nResolved NER Result: | Chemical       |\n|----------------|\n| Methamphetamine |"},
