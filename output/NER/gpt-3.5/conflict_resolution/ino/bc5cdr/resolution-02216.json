However, \"AGEs\" is also identified as a valid \"Disease\" entity in NER Response 1. This is another conflict that needs to be resolved.\n\nTo resolve these conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"AGEs\". Since \"AGEs\" refers to advanced glycation end products, it is more appropriate to classify it as a \"Chemical\" entity rather than a \"Disease\" entity. Therefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering \"AGEs\" as a valid \"Chemical\" entity.\n\nUpdated NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1:\n- Disease: EndoMT\n\nNER Response 2:\n- Chemical: AGEs, Mouse albumin"},
