The other two entities, \"central nervous system toxicity\" and \"cardiac toxicity,\" represent the toxic effects caused by a chemical substance on the central nervous system and heart, respectively.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the given NER responses, there are a few conflicts that need to be resolved:\n\n1. In NER Response 1, \"Central nervous system toxicity\" is identified as a disease, which is incorrect. It should be classified as a symptom or a condition caused by toxicity.\n\n2. In NER Response 2, \"Plasma concentrations\" is identified as a chemical entity, which is incorrect. It should be classified as a measurement or a parameter.\n\nTo resolve these conflicts, the correct classifications should be:\n\nNER Response 1: \n| Symptom/Condition       |\n|-------------------------|\n| Central nervous system toxicity |\n\nNER Response 2: \n| Measurement/Parameter |\n|-----------------------|\n| Plasma concentrations |\n| Central nervous system toxicity |\n| Cardiac toxicity |\n\nBy making these corrections, the conflicts in the NER results have been resolved."},
