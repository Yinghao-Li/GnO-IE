Therefore, \"Thalidomide-induced neuropathy\" should be considered as a condition or a symptom rather than a disease.\n\nConflict 2: There is no conflict in the identification of \"induced neuropathy\" as it is not mentioned in the NER responses.\n\nOverall, the conflicts in the NER results are resolved by considering \"thalidomide\" as a chemical entity and \"Thalidomide-induced neuropathy\" as a condition or a symptom."},
