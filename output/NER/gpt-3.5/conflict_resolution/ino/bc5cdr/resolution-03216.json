However, NER Response 2 identifies \"Proteinuria\" as a chemical entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nBased on the context of the paragraph, it is clear that \"Proteinuria\" is not a chemical entity but a condition related to renal impairment. Therefore, NER Response 1 is correct in identifying \"Proteinuria\" as a disease entity.\n\nStep 3: Final NER results.\n\nBased on the resolution of conflicts, the final NER results are as follows:\n\n| Disease           | Chemical |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Proteinuria       | NGAL     |\n| Renal impairment  |          |"},
