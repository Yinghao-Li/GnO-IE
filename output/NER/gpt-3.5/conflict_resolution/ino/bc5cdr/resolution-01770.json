This is a conflict in the named entity recognition results.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"lymphopenia\" and \"neutropenia\" based on the context of the paragraph.\n\nIn the given paragraph, \"lymphopenia\" and \"neutropenia\" are mentioned as toxicities, which are typically associated with medical conditions or diseases. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider them as \"Disease\" entities rather than \"Chemical\" entities.\n\nHence, the correct resolution for the conflicts is to consider \"lymphopenia\" and \"neutropenia\" as \"Disease\" entities.\n\nResolved NER Response: \n| Disease       |\n|---------------|\n| lymphopenia   |\n| neutropenia   |"},
