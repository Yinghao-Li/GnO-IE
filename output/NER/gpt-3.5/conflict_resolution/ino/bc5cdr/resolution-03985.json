However, it also includes \"Picrotoxin\" as a chemical, which is incorrect. \"Picrotoxin\" should be identified as a disease, not a chemical.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nBased on the paragraph, \"picrotoxin\" is mentioned as a reference drug that prevents seizures. Therefore, it should be identified as a chemical, not a disease. The correct resolution is to update NER Response 2 to identify \"Picrotoxin\" as a chemical, not a disease.\n\nUpdated NER Response 2: \n\n| Chemical |\n|----------|\n| CCK-5-8  |\n| Diazepam |\n| Picrotoxin |\n\nNow, there are no conflicts in the NER results."},
