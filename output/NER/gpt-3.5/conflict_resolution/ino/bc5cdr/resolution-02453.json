Therefore, the correct entity type for \"levodopa-induced dyskinesia\" is Disease.\n\nOn the other hand, \"levodopa\" is mentioned as a potential cause of the dyskinesia. In this context, it is more appropriate to classify \"levodopa\" as a Drug or Medication rather than a Chemical.\n\nResolved NER Response 1: | Disease                  |\n|--------------------------|\n| levodopa-induced dyskinesia |\n\nResolved NER Response 2: | Drug/Medication |\n|-----------------|\n| levodopa        |\n\nBy resolving the conflicts, we have identified the correct entity types for the named entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
