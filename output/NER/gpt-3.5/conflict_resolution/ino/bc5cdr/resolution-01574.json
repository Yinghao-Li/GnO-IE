Without further context, it is difficult to determine the correct entity type.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that \"ATIN\" is written in uppercase letters, which suggests that it might be an acronym or abbreviation. To resolve the conflicts, it would be helpful to consult additional information or domain knowledge to determine the correct entity type for \"ATIN\"."},
