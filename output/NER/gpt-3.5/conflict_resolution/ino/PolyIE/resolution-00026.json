  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: The OFET mobilities are calculated in the saturation regime using the following equation : 2 , where W and L are the channel width and length , respectively , C i is the capacitance per unit area of the insulation layer . Linear plot of I ds 1 / 2 vs V gs deduced from the I ds vs V gs measurement . These devices show characteristics of a typical p - channel transistor with good drain - current Modulation , well - defined linear , and saturation regions ( Figure 2 ) . The summary of the performances is provided in Table 1 . I ds = ( W / 2L ) × μ × C i ( V gs - V th ) The OFET device using as - cast PCDTBT films without thermal annealing exhibits a hole mobility of 2.2 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 / V ° s with an on / off current ratio ( I on / I off ) of 4.44 × 10 ^ 3 . For PCDTBT thin films after annealing at evaluated temperatures , the mobilities are not markedly improved , implying that the PCDTBT thin films remain nearly amorphous for both as - cast and annealing at high temperature . On the other hand , it is found that the unannealed thin films of PCDSeBT exhibit a slightly higher mobility of μ h = 5.1 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 / V ° s , compared with that of pristine PCDTBT . Interestingly , in contrast , as the PCDSeBT thin films are annealed at a temperature of 120 and 150 ° C , the mobilities are systematically improved up to 1.0 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 / V ° s ( Figure 2b ) , which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of PCDTBT , possibly due to increased interpolymer chain contact induced by Se ° ° ° Se interactions with the thermal annealing process . To gain a better understanding of the influence of the thermal annealing , the crystallinity and molecular organization of PCDTBT and PCDSeBT thin films were investigated by Xray diffraction ( XRD ) , both before and after annealing at 150 ° C . Both the as - cast and annealed PCDTBT thin films fail to reveal any defined scattering patterns ( Figure 3a ) , indicating the macroscopically disordered , amorphous structure . In the case of PCDSeBT , the as - cast thin films show very weak diffractions ( Figure 3b ) . Upon thermal annealing , the primary peak at 4.42 ° , corresponding to a d - spacing of 19.99 Å , progressively intensifies and the secondary broad peak at ∼ 21.1 ° ( d = 4.21 Å ) that is probably related to π - π stacking becomes visible ( Figure 3b ) . On the basis of these XRD results , we can conclude that the oriented microstructure of the as - cast PCDSeBT thin films is kinetically limited but the polymer chains reorganize to ordered lamellar packing structures upon annealing . This observation is a plausible explanation for the sudden rise in mobility of PCDSeBT as a function of the thermal annealing .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|--------------|\n| OFET         |\n| PCDTBT       |\n| PCDSeBT      |\n| Se           |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                |\n|------------------------------|\n| OFET mobilities              |\n| channel width                |\n| channel length               |\n| capacitance per unit area    |\n| insulation layer             |\n| I ds (drain-source current)  |\n| V gs (gate-source voltage)   |\n| p-channel transistor         |\n| drain-current modulation     |\n| linear region                |\n| saturation region            |\n| hole mobility                |\n| on/off current ratio         |\n| PCDTBT films                 |\n| thermal annealing            |\n| PCDSeBT                      |\n| annealing temperature        |\n| amorphous structure          |\n| interpolymer chain contact   |\n| Se interactions              |\n| crystallinity                |\n| molecular organization       |\n| scattering patterns          |\n| d-spacing                    |\n| π-π stacking                 |\n| oriented microstructure      |\n| lamellar packing structures  |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| 4.44 × 10^3    |\n| 2.2 × 10^-4 cm^2/V·s |\n| 5.1 × 10^-4 cm^2/V·s |\n| 1.0 × 10^-3 cm^2/V·s |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
