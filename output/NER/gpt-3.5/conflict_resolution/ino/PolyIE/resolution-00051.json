  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: However , P2 with thiophene spacer between two large units 8 and BDT has poor solubility due to more planar conformation and stronger interchain interactions caused by smaller torsion angle . To our surprise , P3 with three solubilizing n - alkyl groups also has poor solubility probably due to strong interchain interactions . Replacing n - dodecyl in P3 with 2 - decyltetradecyl group significantly enhance solubility of P4 . P5 and P6 also have good solubility . Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using polystyrene standards as calibrants . The polymers P1 and P4 - P6 show numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) of 12 ^ 250 , 9934 , 5714 , and 10 ^ 053 , with polydispersity indices ( M w / M n ) of 1.30 , 1.43 , 1.71 , and 1.56 , respectively ( Table 1 ) . The GPC measurements for P2 and P3 are not carried out due to their low solubility . The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) under nitrogen ( Figure 2 ) . The decomposition temperature ( T d ) at 5 % weight loss for P3 - P6 are above 330 ° C , while P1 and P2 exhibit lower Td(below 300 ° C ) ( Table 1 ) . Optical Properties . The UV - vis absorption and photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of P1 - P6 were measured in CHCl 3 ( ca . 10 ^ -6 M ) solution and in thin films , and the results are red - shifted 88 and 112 nm respectively , relative to monomer 4b ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ) due to increased conjugation . Compared to homopolymer P6 , all copolymers P1 - P5 exhibit red - shifted absorptions and smaller optical bandgaps in solution and in film . Broad absorption bands located in the visible region were observed for the solution and film of P1 ( Figure 4 ) . The absorbance maximum for P1 in solution is 496 nm . The absorption spectrum of P1 in film exhibits red - shift and distinct shoulder peak at ca . 540 nm , which are probably related to the formation of molecular aggregates owing to the strong interchain interactions . The absorption maxima of P2 in solution and in film are red - shifted 14 and 32 nm relative to that of P1 , respectively , thanks to its more planar conformation and increased conjugation . P3 and P4 exhibit almost same absorption profile in solution and in film . Compared to P1 and P2 , P3 and P4 exhibit relatively narrow and blue - shifted absorption band in solution and in film . P5 in solution and in film exhibits absorbance maxima at 503 and 524 nm , which are shifted 20 nm to the red relative to those of P4 , suggesting a more planar conformation . The trend in emission spectra of P1 - P6 in solution and in film resembles that in their absorption spectra .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name       |\n|---------------------|\n| P2                  |\n| thiophene           |\n| BDT                 |\n| P3                  |\n| n-alkyl             |\n| n-dodecyl           |\n| 2-decyltetradecyl   |\n| P4                  |\n| P5                  |\n| P6                  |\n| P1                  |\n| P4-P6               |\n| polymers            |\n| GPC                 |\n| polystyrene         |\n| standards           |\n| P2 and P3           |\n| P1 and P2           |\n\nPlease note that the entities are presented precisely as they appear in the original paragraph.\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                |\n|------------------------------|\n| P2                           |\n| thiophene spacer             |\n| BDT                          |\n| P3                           |\n| n-alkyl groups               |\n| n-dodecyl                    |\n| 2-decyltetradecyl            |\n| P4                           |\n| P5                           |\n| P6                           |\n| polymers                     |\n| P1                           |\n| GPC                          |\n| polystyrene standards        |\n| number-average molecular weight |\n| polydispersity indices       |\n| Table 1                      |\n| low solubility               |\n| thermal properties           |\n| thermogravimetric analysis   |\n| TGA                          |\n| decomposition temperature    |\n| weight loss                  |\n| nitrogen                     |\n| optical properties           |\n| UV-vis absorption            |\n| photoluminescence            |\n| CHCl3                        |\n| thin films                   |\n| conjugation                  |\n| homopolymer P6               |\n| copolymers P1-P5             |\n| absorptions                  |\n| optical bandgaps             |\n| broad absorption bands       |\n| visible region               |\n| solution                     |\n| film                         |\n| absorbance maximum           |\n| absorption spectrum          |\n| shoulder peak                |\n| molecular aggregates         |\n| absorption maxima            |\n| emission spectra             |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Poor                                                |\n| Poor                                                |\n| Significantly enhanced                              |\n| Good                                                |\n| Good                                                |\n| 12 ^ 250                                            |\n| 9934                                                |\n| 5714                                                |\n| 10 ^ 053                                            |\n| 1.30                                                |\n| 1.43                                                |\n| 1.71                                                |\n| 1.56                                                |\n| Above 330 °C                                        |\n| Below 300 °C                                        |\n| Red-shifted 88 nm                                   |\n| Red-shifted 112 nm                                  |\n| Measured in CHCl3 solution and in thin films        |\n| Smaller in solution and in film                     |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
