The blends of PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO with PC71BM at different weight ratios were used to optimize the device performances , and their J - V curves are shown in Figure 5 . The PSCs based on PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than that based on PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM . With a weight ratio of PzNDTDTBO to PC71BM 1.5 : 1 , a PCE of 4.37 % with V oc of 0.76 V , J sc of 10.35 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 55.5 % was achieved while the devices based on PzNDTDTBT showed a relatively low PCE of 2.43 % , with V oc of 0.62 V , J sc of 8.21 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 47.7 % at the optimal PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ratio of 1 : 2 ( w / w ) . The increased value of V oc of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs is in accordance with the decreased value of the HOMO energy level of the polymer and the higher J sc and FF could be attributed to the higher hole mobility ( 4.4 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) . By addition of 1 % 1,8 - diiodooctane ( DIO ) into o - DCB used for spin - coating , the PCEs of the solar cells based on PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO were improved to 3.22 and 4.63 % , respectively , mostly through an increase in the FF . 25 To further improve the photovoltaic performances of the PSC devices , thermal annealing was employed . , the FF of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs increased from 62.5 to 65.5 % , and consequently , the PCE increased from 4.63 to 5.07 % . However , for PzNDTDTBT , the measured PCE was not improved by thermal annealing but , inversely , exhibited a slight decrease of photovoltaic values . Compared with PzNDTDTBT / PzNDTDTBO , PSCs based on PzNDTTPD shows higher V oc , which corresponds to the deepest HOMO energy level of PzNDTTPD ( see Table 2 ) . . . Figure 7 shows the AFM images of the active layer surfaces . Without additive or thermal annealing , both the blend films based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO demonstrate smooth morphology with low average surface roughness ( R a ) of 0.27 and 1.23 nm , respectively . After adding DIO , a nanoscaled fine interpenetrating network and smaller domain size of phase separation are formed , which is beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport . R a is raised from 0.27 to 1.91 nm for PzNDTDTBT and from 1.23 to 1.88 nm for PzNDTDTBO , which can explain the increase of FF of the photovoltaic devices to some degree . When the PzNDTDTBO blend film was then thermally annealed at 150 ° C for 10 min , R a is further increased .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|--------------|\n| PzNDTDTBT    |\n| PzNDTDTBO    |\n| PC71BM       |\n| 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) |\n| o-DCB        |\n| PzNDTTPD     |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name |\n|---------------|\n| V oc |\n| J sc |\n| fill factor (FF) |\n| PCE |\n| hole mobility |\n| weight ratios |\n| PzNDTDTBT |\n| PzNDTDTBO |\n| PC71BM |\n| HOMO energy level |\n| 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) |\n| o-DCB |\n| thermal annealing |\n| PzNDTTPD |\n| average surface roughness (R a) |\n| nanoscaled fine interpenetrating network |\n| phase separation |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| 4.37%          |\n| 0.76 V         |\n| 10.35 mA cm^-2 |\n| 55.5%          |\n| 2.43%          |\n| 0.62 V         |\n| 8.21 mA cm^-2  |\n| 47.7%          |\n| 65.5%          |\n| 5.07%          |\n| 1.91 nm        |\n| 1.88 nm        |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
