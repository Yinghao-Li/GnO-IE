The energy levels , absorption spectra and band gaps of the resulting polymers were well tuned by utilizing different thiophene derivatives as spacer between IDT and NT units , and polymer PIDT - C12NT which employed bithiophene attached with dodecyl side chain as spacer exhibited superior properties compared to the other two copolymers . All polymers exhibited deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and subsequently lead to high open circuit voltages of fabricated solar cell devices . Best performance of the bulk - heterojunction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 5.05 % was achieved with PIDT - C12NT as donor and ( 6,6)-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor , which can be attributed to its higher charge carrier mobility , the optimized interpenetrating network as well as enhanced absorption coefficient of photoactive layer with respect to the other two polymers . The results demonstrated that the combination of IDT and NT with appropriate spacers was a promising molecular design strategy for the application of solar cells . During the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted extensive attention due to their lightweight , low cost and great potential for the fabrication of large - area flexible devices . 1 - 3 PSCs based on bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) architecture are of particular interests since high performance devices with power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) exceed 8 % can be achieved . 4 - 9 Typical BHJ devices comprise a phaseseparated donor / acceptor blend layer with low band gap conjugated polymers as the electron donor , and fullerene derivatives such as [ 6,6]-phenyl - C61 - butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or [ 6,6]-phenyl - C71 - butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as the electron acceptor . 10,11 Generally , when considering that open circuit voltage ( V oc ) is related to the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level of donor materials and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of acceptor , 12,13 deep HOMO levels for low band gap conjugated polymers are preferred in order to attain high V oc . However , lowering HOMO level would result in larger band gap , and thereby the absorption of resulted polymers would have less overlap with solar spectrum , which are unfavorable for high short circuit current ( J sc ) . To obtain the ideal low band gap polymer with appropriate energy levels that can make a tradeoff between open circuit voltage ( V oc ) and band gap so as to maximize the PCE , an intriguing approach involves incorporat - ing electron rich moieties ( donor , D ) and electron deficient moieties ( acceptor , A ) and alternating them on the backbone , which are so - called D - A type low band gap conjugated polymers .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| indacenodithiophene (IDT) |\n| naphtho [1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) (NT) |\n| polymer PIDT-C12NT |\n| bithiophene |\n| (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) |\n| (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) |\n| low band gap conjugated polymers |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name |\n|---------------|\n| narrow band gap |\n| coplanar skeleton |\n| energy levels |\n| absorption spectra |\n| band gaps |\n| spacer |\n| superior properties |\n| highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels |\n| open circuit voltages |\n| power conversion efficiency |\n| charge carrier mobility |\n| interpenetrating network |\n| absorption coefficient |\n| molecular design strategy |\n| lightweight |\n| low cost |\n| great potential |\n| bulk - heterojunction |\n| power conversion efficiencies |\n| phaseseparated donor / acceptor blend layer |\n| low band gap |\n| highest occupied molecular orbital |\n| lowest unoccupied molecular orbital |\n| solar spectrum |\n| electron rich moieties |\n| electron deficient moieties |\n| D - A type low band gap conjugated polymers |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Band gaps                                           |\n| Highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels     |\n| Open circuit voltages                               |\n| Charge carrier mobility                            |\n| Absorption coefficient                              |\n| Power conversion efficiency                        |\n| Lightweight                                         |\n| Low cost                                            |\n| Potential for the fabrication of large-area flexible devices |\n| Open circuit voltage (Voc)                          |\n| Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level |\n| Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level |\n| Short circuit current (Jsc)                         |\n| Tradeoff between open circuit voltage (Voc) and band gap |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
