Here , the atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was applied to investigate the morphology of the blend film of the polymer : PC 70 BM fabricated from CB and DCB solutions , respectively , as shown in Fig . 3 . For PDTP - BT : PC 70 BM , both CB and DCB gave the films with obvious phase separation with a root mean square ( RMS ) of 2.222 nm and 0.880 nm , respectively , which might be due to the poor miscibility of the two materials . For PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT , the blend film of polymer / PC 70 BM spin - coated from CB was also rough , but the blend films fabricated from DCB displayed a much smoother surface with a RMS of 0.188 nm and 0.259 nm , respectively . This smaller roughness of the blend film indicates that the domain size of the phase separation of the donor - acceptor interpenetrating network could be reduced , which could be beneficial for the exciton charge separation and charge transport . These results indicate that the morphologies of these polymers with PC 70 BM are quite sensitive to the solvents used for device processing and the introduction of a thienyl spacer could improve the miscibility . The photovoltaic properties of the three copolymers PDTP - BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT were studied by fabricating bulk heterojunction BHJ - type PSCs with a conventional sandwich configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC 70 BM / Ca / Al . The effective areas of the PSCs , contributing to photocurrent , were defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light . The devices were optimized by changing many factors , such as the ratio of the donor and the acceptor , the thickness of blend films and the cathode metal . The best performance was obtained with the thickness of the active layer of 80 - 90 nm , the copolymers : PC 70 BM ratio of 1 : 2 ( by weight ) and the Ca / Al used as the cathode . Fig . 4 shows the J - V curves of the optimized PSCs based on the three polymers under illumination of AM 1.5 simulated solar light ( 100 mW cm^-2 ) . The PSCs with two kinds of solvents CB and DCB for the spin - coating of the active layers were investigated , and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short - circuit current density ( J SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) and PCE are summarized in Table 2 . When CB was used as the solvent , all the combinations showed a relatively low PCE of 0.87 % , 1.97 % and 1.92 % in the devices with PDTP - BT : PC 70 BM , PDTP - DTBT : PC 70 BM and PDTP - DT2BT : PC 70 BM respectively .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|--------------|\n| copolymers |\n| blend films |\n| fullerene derivatives |\n| polymer |\n| PC 70 BM |\n| CB |\n| DCB |\n| PDTP-BT |\n| PDTP-DTBT |\n| PDTP-DT2BT |\n| donor-acceptor interpenetrating network |\n| thienyl spacer |\n| bulk heterojunction BHJ-type PSCs |\n| ITO |\n| PEDOT:PSS |\n| Ca |\n| Al |\n| active layer |\n| cathode |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                            |\n|------------------------------------------|\n| Copolymers                               |\n| Fullerene derivatives                    |\n| Charge transport properties              |\n| Efficiencies                             |\n| Microstructure                           |\n| Morphology                               |\n| Blend film                               |\n| Polymer                                  |\n| Solvents                                 |\n| Phase separation                         |\n| Root mean square (RMS)                   |\n| Miscibility                              |\n| Domain size                              |\n| Donor-acceptor interpenetrating network  |\n| Exciton charge separation                |\n| Thienyl spacer                           |\n| Photovoltaic properties                  |\n| Bulk heterojunction (BHJ)                |\n| PSCs (Photovoltaic Solar Cells)          |\n| Active layer                             |\n| Metal photomask                          |\n| Simulated solar light                    |\n| Ratio of the donor and the acceptor       |\n| Thickness of blend films                 |\n| Cathode metal                            |\n| Open-circuit voltage (VOC)               |\n| Short-circuit current density (JSC)      |\n| Fill factor (FF)                         |\n| PCE (Power Conversion Efficiency)        |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| 2.222 nm (CB solution) |\n| 0.880 nm (DCB solution) |\n| 0.188 nm (DCB solution) |\n| 0.259 nm (DCB solution) |\n| 80-90 nm |\n| 0.87% |\n| 1.97% |\n| 1.92% |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
