Even though PFDTBT_20Per showed the highest hole mobility among the PFDTBT - based copolymers , it is UV - visible absorption spectrum showed greater blue - shifting than PFDTBT , as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , and it showed the widest band gap energy among all of the polymers considered herein . This may be why the short circuit current of the device fabricated using PFDTBT_20Per is lower than that of PFDTBT , despite it higher mobility . The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the best photovoltaic performance among the PFDTBT - based polymers ( V oc = 0.74 V , J sc = 7.19 mA / cm^2 , PCE = 2.16 % ) . For the photovoltaic devices fabricated using PFD2TBT - based polymers , the shortcircuit currents of the devices also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased ; however , the PCEs of the devices using PFD2TBT - based polymers were lower than those of PFDTBT - based polymers because of lower open - circuit voltages and short - circuit currents . The device fabricated using PFD2TBT_10Per showed the highest PCE ( 1.51 % ) among the PFD2TBT - based polymers . The characteristics of the ITO / 4 . Figure 8 shows that the J - V characteristics of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices provide a similar trend to those of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices but their PCEs increased mainly due to increased short circuit currents . The increase in the short circuit current originates from the introduction of the thin titanium suboxide ( TiO x ) layer ( ca . âˆ¼ 10 nm ) . The titanium suboxide layer could block holes to the aluminum electrode , thus it could increase the short circuit current of the photovoltaic device . The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the highest PCE of 3.16 % with an open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , a short circuit current of 9.61 mA / cm^2 and the highest fill factor ( 0.41 ) among the fabricated devices . The characteristics of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices are summarized in Table 5 . Figure 9 shows the incident photon - to - current conversion efficiency ( IPCE ) spectra of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PFDTBT-10Per + PC71BM / LiF and TiO x / Al devices . The absorption onset corresponding to the photon - to - current conversion efficiency was about 750 nm for these devices , and the absorption onset values corresponding to the maximum conversion efficiency values were 427 and 560 nm . The morphologies of the polymers and PC71BM blend films were observed by tapping - mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name       |\n|---------------------|\n| perylene units      |\n| polymer             |\n| PFDTBT_20Per        |\n| PFDTBT              |\n| PFDTBT-10Per        |\n| PFDTBT-20Per        |\n| PFDTBT-10Per        |\n| PFDTBT - based polymers |\n| PFD2TBT - based polymers |\n| PFD2TBT_10Per       |\n| ITO                 |\n| PEDOT : PSS         |\n| polymer : PC71BM    |\n| TiO x               |\n| Al                  |\n| LiF                 |\n| PFDTBT-10Per + PC71BM |\n| AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Short circuit current                              |\n| Number of perylene units                           |\n| Hole mobility                                      |\n| UV-visible absorption spectrum                     |\n| Blue-shifting                                      |\n| Band gap energy                                    |\n| Photovoltaic performance                           |\n| Open-circuit voltage                               |\n| PCE (Power Conversion Efficiency)                  |\n| J-V characteristics                                |\n| Thin titanium suboxide layer                       |\n| Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency   |\n| Absorption onset                                   |\n| Morphologies                                       |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value                           |\n|------------------------------------------|\n| Voc = 0.74 V                             |\n| Jsc = 7.19 mA/cm^2                       |\n| PCE = 2.16%                              |\n| 0.74 V                                   |\n| 7.19 mA/cm^2                             |\n| 2.16%                                    |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
