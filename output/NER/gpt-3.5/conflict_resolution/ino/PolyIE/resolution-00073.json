Therefore , the spacers consist of thiophene or bithiophene functionalized with various alkyl side chains were introduced in between IDT and NT units to improve the solubility of the resulting polymers , which may also potentially lead to improved molecular weight that is favorable for the optimal morphology and charge carrier transport . 39 - 41 We notice that the incorporated side chains may also increase the dihedral angle of their contiguous aromatic units , 42,43 which may somewhat inhibit polymer backbone planarity and thereby increase band gap and lower the charge carrier mobility . 40,41 However , it should be tried several different alkyl side chains to achieve a delicate balance of the molecular weight , solubility as well as planarity of polymers as no comprehensive rule has yet emerged of the influences of specific side chains . 44,45 It was realized that by switching the spacer between the IDT and NT units , the processability , backbone planarity , charge carrier mobility and film morphology can be optimized . Further investigation of photovoltaic performances indicates all devices present high V oc because of the relatively deep HOMO energy levels of these polymers , and the highest PCE of 5.05 % was achieved based on PIDT - C12NT . Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ; see Figure 1 ) were used to probe thermal properties . No phase transition was observed for all three polymers by DSC analysis up to 300 ° C. All polymers have decomposition temperature ( defined as the 5 % weight - loss temperature , T d ) over 450 ° C under nitrogen as determined by TGA analysis , indicating their excellent thermal stabilities . Optical and Electrochemical Properties . The UV - vis absorption spectra of all polymers in both chlorobenzene solution ( 1 × 10 ^ -3 mg mL -1 ) and as thin films ( spin - casted from chlorobenzene solutions with concentration of 8 mg mL -1 ) are shown in Figure 2 . All three polymers exhibit dual characteristic absorption bands , where the short wavelength absorbance originated from the π - π * transition of the IDT unit , while the long wavelength absorbance could be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the IDT and the NT segments . 27 In chlorobenzene ( CB ) solution , PIDT - EHNT showed an absorption maximum at 599 nm and a slightly weaker peak at 433 nm ; when changing the branched 2ethylhexyl to linear hexyl side chain , the resulted polymer PIDT - DTNT showed a slightly bathochromic shift of two corresponding peaks to 608 and 439 nm , respectively , which may due to the reduced steric hindrance of the linear side chain .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| IDT           |\n| NT            |\n| tetraoctylbenzene |\n| thiophene |\n| bithiophene |\n| alkyl side chains |\n| polymers |\n| molecular weight |\n| solubility |\n| planarity |\n| band gap |\n| charge carrier mobility |\n| spacer |\n| processability |\n| film morphology |\n| PIDT-C12NT |\n| Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) |\n| thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) |\n| UV-vis absorption spectra |\n| chlorobenzene solution |\n| thin films |\n| π-π* transition |\n| intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) |\n| PIDT-EHNT |\n| PIDT-DTNT |\n| steric hindrance |\n| linear side chain |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                                                                                      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| coplanar structures                                                                               |\n| polymer backbone                                                                                  |\n| carbon bridges                                                                                    |\n| solubility in common organic solvents                                                             |\n| spacers                                                                                           |\n| solubility                                                                                        |\n| molecular weight                                                                                  |\n| planarity                                                                                         |\n| processability                                                                                    |\n| backbone planarity                                                                                |\n| charge carrier mobility                                                                           |\n| film morphology                                                                                   |\n| photovoltaic performances                                                                         |\n| HOMO energy levels                                                                                |\n| PCE                                                                                               |\n| thermal stabilities                                                                               |\n| UV-vis absorption spectra                                                                         |\n| absorption maximum                                                                                |\n| peak                                                                                              |\n| steric hindrance                                                                                   |\n\nNote: The entities have been presented precisely as mentioned in the original paragraph.\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| 5.05%          |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
