When the morphologies of active layers were observed by transmission electron microscopy , the PTATDPP : PC71BM blend shows clearly a fibril nanostructure ( fibril width ∼ 30 nm ) with the formation of a bi - continuous network , whereas the PTAFDPP : PC71BM blend shows a phase - separated morphology without the formation of distinct nanostructures , as shown in Fig . 5 . It is well recognized that the nanoscale phase separation with a fibril structure is favourable for an efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport which are the prerequisites for high J SC and FF of PSCs . Therefore , the high FF ( 0.68 ) of PTATDPP - based device arises mainly from the efficient charge - carrier mobility and the formation of a nanoscale fibril structure of PTATDPP . To further evaluate the potential of PTATDPP as an electron donor material for PSCs , we fabricated a non - fullerene PSC device by blending PTATDPP with a non - fullerene small molecular electron acceptor , 2,2′9,9′-tetra(undecan-6 - yl)- [ 5,5′bianthra ( 2,1,9 - def:6,5,10 - d′e′f′)diisoquinolin]-1,1′,3,3′,8,8′,10,10′- ( 2H,2′H,9H,9′H)-octaone ( di - PBI ) . 38 As can be seen in Fig . 6a , PTATDPP and di - PBI have well - matched energy levels with a LUMO - LUMO offset of 0.4 eV , 39 which is enough for exciton dissociation , and also exhibit complementary absorption , i.e. , di - PDI and PTATDPP absorb 400 - 600 nm and 600 - 800 nm , respectively . As a consequence , the blend film ( 1 : 2 in weight ratio ) exhibits a broad light absorption from 400 to 800 nm . The compatibility of PTATDPP and di - PBI as an electron donor and an acceptor , respectively , was also examined by monitoring the photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching of each compound in the blend film . As shown in Fig . 6c , the blend film shows excellent PL quenching over 95 % of each PL from PTATDPP and di - PBI , indicating that photogenerated excitons from both PTATDPP and di - PBI are readily dissociated into free carriers at the interface of two materials . The non - fullerene PSC fabricated from the blend of PTATDPP and di - PBI exhibits a PCE of 4.23 % with V OC = 0.77 V , J SC = 9.8 mA cm^-2 and FF = 0.56 ( Fig . 7 ) . Interestingly , the blend morphology of PTATDPP and di - PDI as observed from atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and TEM reveals that PTATDPP forms a well - developed interconnected BHJ morphology with a fibrillar nanostructure ( Fig . S4 and S5 † ) . This fibril morphology affords the effective exciton dissociation as observed from the PL quenching experiment .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|--------------|\n| PTATDPP      |\n| PC71BM       |\n| PTAFDPP      |\n| di-PBI       |\n| di-PDI       |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name |\n|---------------|\n| higher crystalline nature |\n| better hole transporting pathway |\n| nanoscale fibril structure |\n| electron donor material |\n| blend with PTATDPP |\n| bi-continuous network |\n| lower J SC and FF compared to PTATDPP |\n| non-fullerene small molecular electron acceptor |\n| well-matched energy levels with PTATDPP |\n| complementary absorption |\n| well-developed interconnected BHJ morphology with a fibrillar nanostructure |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|---------------|\n| Fibril width: ∼ 30 nm |\n| FF: 0.68 |\n| LUMO-LUMO offset: 0.4 eV |\n| PCE: 4.23% |\n| V OC: 0.77 V |\n| J SC: 9.8 mA cm^-2 |\n| FF: 0.56 |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
