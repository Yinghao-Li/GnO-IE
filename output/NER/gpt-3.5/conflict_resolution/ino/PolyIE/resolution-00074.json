Analogous event has also been realized in D - A type of oligomers and polymers based on 3,4bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)thiophene or 2 - ethylhexyloxy - substituted 3,4 - propylenedioxythiophene as donor and BT as acceptor , which demonstrated that with the depleting composition of BT unit along the conjugated backbone , the dual absorbing bands were induced to move toward the maximum absorption ( λ max ) of the all - donor homopolymer that located in between of the dual absorbance . 52 In solid state , all polymers showed red - shifted absorption spectra compare to their solution absorption ( Figure 2b ) , which could be ascribed to the aggregation of polymer main chain . We realized a slightly bathochromic shift of the PIDT - DTNT absorbance relative to that of the PIDT - EHNT , which was in consistent with the trend realized in solution , while PIDT - C12NT showed a pronounced bathochromic shift of the low energy band absorption with λ max moved from 593 nm in solution to 619 nm as thin film . It was also worth noting that PIDT - C12NT showed much higher absorption coefficient than other two polymers in the whole visible area . Considering that high photo flux of solar spectrum within the region of about 550 - 700 nm , more intensified absorption of PIDT - C12NT indicated that more sunlight can be harvested that would potentially lead to higher J sc than the other two polymers . The optical band gaps of the polymers are in the range of 1.64 - 1.69 eV as estimated from the absorption onset and the detailed results are summarized in Table 1 . Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements were carried out to evaluate the molecular frontier orbitals of the resulted polymers . The graphite , platinum wire , and Ag / AgCl were used as the working electrode , counter electrode , and reference electrode , respectively . Polymer films were casted from chlorobenzene solution with concentration of 8 mg mL -1 and all measurements were carried out under inert atmosphere . Figure 3 showed the oxidation of cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films on graphite disk electrode in tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate ( Bu 4 NPF 6 ) solution ( 0.1 M in acetonitrile ) at a scan rate of 50 mV s^-1 .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|\n| conjugated polymers                                |\n| thiophene units                                    |\n| PIDT-C12NT                                         |\n| D-A type of oligomers and polymers                 |\n| 3,4bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene                    |\n| 2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene |\n| BT                                                 |\n| all-donor homopolymer                              |\n| polymer main chain                                 |\n| PIDT-DTNT                                          |\n| PIDT-EHNT                                          |\n| thin film                                          |\n| absorption coefficient                             |\n| optical band gaps                                  |\n| Table 1                                            |\n| chlorobenzene solution                            |\n| tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6)   |\n| acetonitrile                                       |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                       |\n|-------------------------------------|\n| Band gaps                           |\n| π-electron system                   |\n| Bathochromic shift                  |\n| Short wavelength absorption peak     |\n| Hypsochromic shift                  |\n| Long wavelength absorption peak      |\n| Relative intensity                  |\n| High and low-energy peaks            |\n| Dual absorbing bands                |\n| Maximum absorption (λmax)            |\n| Dual absorbance            |\n| Absorption spectra                  |\n| Aggregation of polymer main chain    |\n| Absorption coefficient               |\n| Solar spectrum                      |\n| Jsc (short-circuit current density) |\n| Optical band gaps                   |\n| Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements |\n| Molecular frontier orbitals          |\n| Working electrode                |\n| Counter electrode                   |\n| Reference electrode                 |\n| Polymer films                       |\n| Oxidation of cyclic voltammograms    |\n| Tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) solution |\n| Scan rate                           |\n\nThe valid entities, precisely presented in the same words as in the original paragraph, are listed in the Markdown table above.\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n| --- |\n| 1.64 - 1.69 eV |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
