We have designed and synthesized two anthracene - based low band - gap copolymers , PTATDPP and PTAFDPP . Since the TA unit has a highly conjugated 2 - D structure with a weak electron - donating nature , the copolymer composed of TA and DPP units shows a relatively low band - gap , a low - lying HOMO energy level , high crystallinity , and efficient charge transporting characteristics . The PSCs fabricated from PTATDPP and PTAFDPP with PC71BM exhibit PCEs as high as 7.02 % and 5.22 % , respectively . Furthermore , PTATDPP shows a promising PCE of 4.23 % when a non - fullerene acceptor ( di - PBI ) is used as an electron acceptor material for the PSC device . These results not only demonstrate that thienyl - substituted anthracene is a very promising building block as an electron - donating unit of low band - gap polymers for high performance PSCs but also PTATDPP can be used as a universal electron donor material compatible with various electron acceptor materials in PSCs .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name            |\n|--------------------------|\n| non-fullerene PSC        |\n| PC71BM                   |\n| PTATDPP                  |\n| PTAFDPP                  |\n| di-PBI                   |\n| thienyl-substituted anthracene |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                  |\n|--------------------------------|\n| PCE (photovoltaic performance) |\n| V_OC (photovoltaic parameters) |\n| J_SC (photovoltaic parameters) |\n| FF (photovoltaic parameters)   |\n| low band-gap                   |\n| low-lying HOMO energy level    |\n| high crystallinity             |\n| efficient charge transporting characteristics |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| over 4% PCE    |\n| 7.02%          |\n| 5.22%          |\n| 4.23%          |\n| Low band-gap   |\n| High crystallinity |\n| Efficient charge transporting characteristics |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
