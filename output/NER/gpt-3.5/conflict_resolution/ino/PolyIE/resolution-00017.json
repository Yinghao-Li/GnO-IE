  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: 5 - 13 Careful combinations of donor and acceptor units have yielded low band polymers with a band gap of 1.3 - 1.7 eV , which lead to high PCEs exceeding 7 % . 14 - 17 A variety of good donor moieties , including oligothiophenes , 18 - 23 carbazole , 24 benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene , 25 - 27 and dithienosilole , 14,28 have been demonstrated as useful for low band gap polymers ; good acceptor moieties including thieno- [ 3,4 - b]thiophenes substituted with electron - withdrawing groups , 29 - 31 N - alkylthieno [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-4,6 - dione , 25,28 benzothiadiazole , 24,32 and 2,5 - bis(2 - alkyl)pyrrolo [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione 33 - 36 have been developed . However , good acceptor moieties enabling polymers to absorb wavelengths over 800 nm remain still rare though acceptor moieties strongly affected to produce a narrow band gap . 37 - 40 In search of new acceptor moieties , we designed an interesting structure of N - octyl-2,7 - dithia-5 - azacyclopenta[a]-pentalene-4,6 - dione ( DTPD ) . The DTPD is a structural combination of thieno [ 3,4 - b]thiophene and N - alkylpyrrole-2,5 - dione . The thieno [ 3,4 - b]thiophene is a particularly suitable structure to promote quinoid structures in conjugated polymers . 41 - 44 However , simple incorporation of the thieno- [ 3,4 - b]thiophene units might increase the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) level of polymers , which causes a significant loss of open - circuit voltages in PSCs . 42 Thus , it is desirable to attach electron - withdrawing groups such as ketone or ester groups and fluorine atoms . 12,15,30 Here we glued the Nalkylpyrrole-2,5 - dione , a strong electron - withdrawing unit , 45 to the thieno [ 3,4 - b]thiophene to bring down the HOMO level . Our DFT calculations , indeed , suggested that the DTPD would be a strong electron - withdrawing acceptor moiety ( Figure S1 ) . 26,45 Therefore , each fractional unit in the DTPD may exert a synergetic effect to permit strong donor - acceptor electronic delocalization by the quinoid structure and to locate HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) levels of resulting low band gap polymers in a deep state when the DTPD is copolymerized with an appropriate donor moiety . Despite these promising features , to the best of our knowledge , the DTPD moiety has never been utilized to synthesize low band gap polymers for PSCs . Herein , we report synthesis and characterization of two polymers , POBDTPD and PEBDTPD , that consist of DTPD and BDT moieties substituted with octyloxy or 2 - ethylhexyloxy g r o u p s , r e s p e c t i v e l y . P O B D T P D : P C 7 ^ 0 B M a n d PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blends utilized light absorption up to 900 nm in the generation of photocurrents and showed optimal morphology and efficient exciton separation , yielding PCEs exceeding 5 % . This work demonstrates that the newly designed DTPD moiety is a promising building block for high performance PSCs . The thermal properties of the polymers were examined by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . In the DSC curve , neither polymer displayed a transition up to 300 ° C ( Figure S2a , b ) .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| oligothiophenes |\n| carbazole |\n| benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene |\n| dithienosilole |\n| thieno-[3,4-b]thiophenes |\n| N-alkylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione |\n| 2,5-bis(2-alkyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione |\n| N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5-azacyclopenta[a]-pentalene-4,6-dione (DTPD) |\n| BDT (benzodithiophene) |\n| thieno-[3,4-b]thiophenes |\n| N-alkylpyrrole-2,5-dione |\n| ketone |\n| ester groups |\n| fluorine atoms |\n| DTPD |\n| PC70BM (phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Band gap                                                    |\n| Donor moieties                                              |\n| Acceptor moieties                                           |\n| Oligothiophenes                                             |\n| Carbazole                                                   |\n| Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene                               |\n| Dithienosilole                                              |\n| Thieno-[3,4-b]thiophenes substituted with electron-withdrawing groups |\n| N-alkylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione                       |\n| Benzothiadiazole                                            |\n| 2,5-bis(2-alkyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione      |\n| N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5-azacyclopenta[a]-pentalene-4,6-dione (DTPD) |\n| Thieno[3,4-b]thiophene                                       |\n| N-alkylpyrrole-2,5-dione                                     |\n| Ketone or ester groups                                      |\n| Fluorine atoms                                              |\n| BDT moieties (benzodithiophene)                              |\n| Octyloxy or 2-ethylhexyloxy groups                           |\n| PC70BM (phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester)                |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value       |\n|----------------------|\n| 1.3 - 1.7 eV         |\n| exceeding 7%         |\n| over 800 nm          |\n| bringing down        |\n| locating in a deep state |\n| up to 900 nm         |\n| no transition up to 300 °C |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
