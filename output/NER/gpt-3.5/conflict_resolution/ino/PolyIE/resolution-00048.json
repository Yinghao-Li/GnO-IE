  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: Significant progress has been made in synthesis of conjugated polymers and their applications for optoelectronic device such as organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , organic photovoltaic cells ( OPVs ) , and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) since Heeger , MacDiarmid , and Shirakawa discovered conducting polymers in 1976.^1 As a result of the low - cost , light - weight , and flexibility advantages , optoelectronic devices based on conjugated polymers are a promising cost - effective alternative to inorganic materials - based microelectronics . Conjugated polymers can be classified as hole ( p - type ) or electron ( n - type ) transporting materials according to the type of orderly transferring charge carriers . Most of conjugated polymers are p - type semiconductors that have seen a dramatic rise in performance over the past decade while much less attention has been devoted to n - type semiconducting polymers that have lagged behind their p - type counterparts . 2 Organic n - type materials are essential for the fabrication of organic p - n junctions , OPVs , n - channel OFETs , OLEDs , and complementary logic circuits . 3 The n - type building blocks are the core components in n - type semiconducting polymers . Aromatic imides such as rylene diimides are one of the classical n - type building blocks and can exhibit relatively high electron affinities , high electron mobilities , and excellent chemical , thermal , and photochemical stabilities . 4 These materials are electron deficient due to the substitution of an aromatic core with one or two sets of π - accepting imide groups that are mutually conjugated . The widely used rylene diimides include perylene diimides ( PDIs , 1 ) and naphthalene diimides ( NDIs , 2 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Zhan and co - workers reported the synthesis of the first soluble rylene - based fully conjugated polymer . 5 Top - gate OFETs based on this PDI- dithienothiophene copolymer exhibited a saturation electron mobility ( μ e ) of 6 x 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , current on / off ratio ( I on / I off ) of 10 ^ 4 , and a low threshold voltage ( V th ) of 7 V in air . 6 Moreover , all - polymer solar cells based on blends of polythiophene derivative donors and PDI - dithienothiophene copolymer acceptors exhibited power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as high as 1.5 % ( AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 ) . 7 - 9 Facchetti et al . reported a conjugated copolymer of NDI and bithiophene ; 10 OFET devices based on this polymer fabricated in a top - gate , bottom - contact configuration with polymeric dielectrics exhibited μ e of 0.1 - 0.85 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 under ambient conditions with I on / I off > 10 ^ 5 . 11 The simplest aromatic imide system is phthalimide ( 3 ) and thiophene imide ( 4 ) ( Figure 1 ) . A few literatures reported phthalimide - containing conjugated polymers such as poly-(phenylene ethynylene)s , 12 a polyaniline derivative , 13 and a polythiophene derivative .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|--------------|\n| Conjugated polymers |\n| Conducting polymers |\n| Inorganic materials |\n| Hole (p-type) transporting materials |\n| Electron (n-type) transporting materials |\n| P-type semiconductors |\n| N-type semiconducting polymers |\n| Aromatic imides |\n| Rylene diimides |\n| Perylene diimides (PDIs) |\n| Naphthalene diimides (NDIs) |\n| Rylene-based fully conjugated polymer |\n| PDI-dithienothiophene copolymer |\n| Polythiophene derivative donors |\n| Polythiophene derivative acceptors |\n| Conjugated copolymer of NDI and bithiophene |\n| Phthalimide |\n| Thiophene imide |\n| Poly-(phenylene ethynylene)s |\n| Polyaniline derivative |\n| Polythiophene derivative |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                  |\n|--------------------------------|\n| Transporting materials         |\n| P-type semiconductors          |\n| N-type semiconducting polymers |\n| Aromatic imides                |\n| Rylene diimides                |\n| Perylene diimides (PDIs)       |\n| Naphthalene diimides (NDIs)    |\n| Polythiophene derivative donors |\n| Polythiophene derivative acceptors |\n| Conjugated copolymer of NDI and bithiophene |\n| Phthalimide                    |\n| Thiophene imide                |\n| Poly-(phenylene ethynylene)s   |\n| Polyaniline derivative         |\n| Polythiophene derivative       |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value                |\n|------------------------------|\n| 6 x 10^-2 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1      |\n| 10^4                         |\n| 7 V                          |\n| 1.5% (AM1.5, 100 mW cm^-2)   |\n| 0.1 - 0.85 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1     |\n| > 10^5                       |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
