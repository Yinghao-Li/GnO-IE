In order to develop high - performance side - chain D - A conjugated polymers , it is necessary to develop new catalog of side - chain D - A polymers for efficient PSCs . Given that benzo [ 1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) unit has a large planar molecular structure by fusing a benzene with two flanking thiophenyl units and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) , i.e. , pyrrolo[3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione unit has a well conjugated structure with strong π - π interaction and electron - withdrawing effect , some main - chain D - A copolymers based on DPP or / and BDT units as prime building block had been designed for optoelectronic applications in both thin - film transistors and solar cells in recent years . 6 It is worthy to note that PSCs based on these copolymers with a tandem structure showed an increasing PCE of 8.62 % . 2a Here we report another novel sidechain D - A conjugated copolymer ( PBDT - TDPP - S ) for highperformance PSCs , in which the BDT and thiophene units are conjugatedly formed the main chain and the di(thiophen-2yl)pyrrolo [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione ( TDPP ) units are pended onto the thiophenyl units to build the side chain by a linkage of a 2 - vinylthiophenyl unit . Using PBDT - TDPP - S as electron donor and PC71BM as electron acceptor , the resulting PSCs exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a PCE of 4.89 % , an open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.84 V , a shortcircuit current ( J SC ) of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 56.0 % . To our best knowledge , the efficiency is among the highest reported to date for side - chain D - A conjugated copolymers and is twice higher than that of the main - chain D - A counterpart polymer PBDTDPP - OR in the single BHJ PSCs . synthesized by a common Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as catalyst with a high yield of 78.7 % , as shown in Scheme 1 . For comparison , the corresponding main - chain D - A conjugated copolymer of PBDT - DPP was made at the same time . The resulting PBDT - TDPP - S showed good solubility in common organic solvents , such as chlorobenzene , o - dichlorobenzene , and dichloromethane ( DCM ) , but PBDT - DPP was nearly not soluble in them . Gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis showed that PBDT - TDPP - S has a numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) of 1.34 × 10 ^ 4 g mol^-1 with a polydispersity index of 1.27 ( Figure S1 ) . Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) indicated that PBDT - TDPP - S has high thermal stability with a degradation temperature ( T d ) of 364 ° C at 5 % weight loss . The corresponding molecular weights and thermal properties of PBDT - TDPP - S are summarized in Table 1 , and the recorded TGA curve is shown in Figure S2 ( see Supporting Information ) . The UV - vis absorption spectra of PBDT - TDPP - S in DCM solution and solid film are shown in Figure 1a .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| side-chain D-A conjugated polymers |\n| main-chain D-A counterpart polymers |\n| side-chain D-A polymers |\n| benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) |\n| diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) |\n| main-chain D-A copolymers |\n| di(thiophen-2yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (TDPP) units |\n| PBDT-TDPP-S |\n| PC71BM |\n| PBDTDPP-OR |\n| PBDT-DPP |\n| chlorobenzene |\n| o-dichlorobenzene |\n| dichloromethane (DCM) |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                  |\n|-------------------------------|\n| benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) |\n| diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)         |\n| pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (TDPP) |\n| PBDT-TDPP-S                     |\n| PC71BM                        |\n| PBDTDPP-OR                     |\n| PBDT-DPP                       |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value       |\n|----------------------|\n| 0.84 V               |\n| 10.04 mA cm^-2       |\n| 56.0%                |\n| 1.34 × 10^4 g mol^-1 |\n| 1.27                 |\n| 364 °C               |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
