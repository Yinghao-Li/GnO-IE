The electrochemical properties of PCDSeBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) . As shown in Figure 1b , PCDSeBT exhibits clear reversible n - doping / dedoping processes in the negative potential range , whereas quasi - reversible p - doping / dedoping behaviors in the positive potential range are observed . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be -5.40 eV and -3.70 eV , respectively , using the ferrocene - ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc+ ) redox couple ( 4.8 eV below the vacuum level ) . Both PCDTBT and PCDSeBT have nearly identical HOMO energy levels , but PCDSeBT exhibits 0.10 eV lower - lying LUMO level relative to PCDTBT ( LUMO = -3.60 eV , see also Supporting Information ) , 5a verifying our presumption aforementioned about the effect of selenium on the selective fine - tuning of LUMO level . The material - design rules described by Scharber et al . 19 suggested that the PCEs of a BHJ solar cell should be much more sensitive to changes of the donor LUMO level compared to variations of the donor bandgap . On the basis of the rules , the estimated PCE from the E g opt and the LUMO value of PCDSeBT is 7.8 % . This theoretical value is much higher than that of PCDTBT ( 6.5 % ) , indicating that a highly promising material for PSCs considering the frontier orbital energies . Upon utilizing a model dimeric system containing methyl groups , the optimized molecular geometry of PCDSeBT and its frontier molecular orbitals of the calculated HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces were computed by density functional theory ( DFT , B3LYP / 6 - 31 G ) ( Figure 1d ) . The HOMO of PCDSeBT is well - distributed along the conjugated chains ; its LUMO is mainly centralized on BT accepting core as shaped by orbital lobes , being predicted a p - type organic semiconductor . In order to corroborate the effect of the heteroatom substitution on charge transporting properties of the polymers , top - contact organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) were fabricated using solution processed PCDTBT and PCDSeBT , respectively , as the semiconducting layer on the octadecyltrichlorosilane ( OTS ) self - assembled monolayer ( SAM)-modified Si / SiO 2 substrates ( see the detailed devices fabrication in the Experimental Section ) .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|--------------|\n| thiophene |\n| selenophene |\n| polymer |\n| PCDSeBT |\n| PDCTBT |\n| Se |\n| film |\n| PCDTBT |\n| HOMO |\n| LUMO |\n| ferrocene |\n| ferrocenium |\n| BT |\n| octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) |\n| self - assembled monolayer (SAM) |\n| Si / SiO 2 substrates |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name |\n|---------------|\n| optical bandgap |\n| fwhm |\n| intermolecular Se interactions |\n| JSC value |\n| electrochemical properties |\n| HOMO energy level |\n| LUMO energy level |\n| PCE |\n| frontier orbital energies |\n| molecular geometry |\n| frontier molecular orbitals |\n| charge transporting properties |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| Full width at half-maximum: PCDSeBT - 155 nm, PDCTBT - 140 nm |\n| HOMO energy level: PCDSeBT - -5.40 eV |\n| LUMO energy level: PCDSeBT - -3.70 eV, PCDTBT - -3.60 eV |\n| PCE (power conversion efficiency): PCDSeBT - 7.8%, PCDTBT - 6.5% |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
