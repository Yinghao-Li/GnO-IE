The PSC based on J91 / m - ITIC as an active layer with thermal annealing gave a high PCE of 11.63 % with a high V oc of 0.98 V and a J sc of 18.03 mA cm^-2 . 36 The improved cell performance was attributed to the suppression of carrier recombination imposed by the difluorosubstituted side chain . In addition to influencing molecular and functional properties of donor polymers , the structural modification could lead to severe aggregation , which could hamper solution processability of a polymer . On the other hand , aggregation could be desirable and provide a useful tool to control the bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) film morphology and then the photovoltaic performance of a solar cell . Yan and co - workers employed the branched alkyl chains attached on the backbone of the difluorobenzothiadiazole - quaterthiophene ( PffBT4 T ) copolymer to acquire desirable temperature - dependent aggregation behavior . By spin - casting the polymer solution at an elevated temperature , they could control the morphology and crystallinity of the polymer films . Taking advantage of this aggregation control approach , high - performance PSCs based on PffBT4T-2OD : PC71BM were fabricated affording a PCE of up to 10.8 % . 9 Guo and co - workers used a number of fused thiophene spacers to tune the aggregation behavior of difluorobenzoxadiazole ( ffBX)-based donor polymers among which PffBX - TT with thieno[3,2 - b]thiophene as a spacer showed intermediate temperature - dependent aggregation strength allowing the control of blend film morphology during PSC fabrication . PSCs using PffBX - TT : PC71BM as an active layer gave a maximum PCE of 9.10 % . 37 Previously , we developed a class of benzodithiophene - based donor polymers with fluoro - dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole being an acceptor unit that showed interesting temperature - dependent aggregation behavior when equipped with linear alkyl side chains . PSCs based on these polymers : PC71BM blend layers showed good photovoltaic performance with a maximum PCE as high as 9.70 % . 38 In this contribution , we reported a new series of donor polymer materials based on benzodithiophene ( BDT ) and difluorinated dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole , PffBB - n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16 ) , which exhibited strong aggregation behavior in both solution and thin films . In addition to the size of alkyl side chains attached on the backbone of the polymer , aggregation can be modulated by the solvent used and temperature applied on the film with which the absorption cut - off extended down to ∼ 780 nm in thin films , resulting in a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Such wide absorption is desirable and complementary to that of the commonly used PC71BM acceptor material in the visible light region , which can increase light harvesting in BHJ PSCs .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| difluoro - substituted thiopheneconjugated side chain |\n| bi(alkyl - difluorothienyl)benzodithiophene - fluorobenzotriazole copolymer J91 |\n| Article nonfluorinated control polymer |\n| J91 / m - ITIC |\n| donor polymers |\n| branched alkyl chains |\n| difluorobenzothiadiazole - quaterthiophene (PffBT4T) copolymer |\n| fused thiophene spacers |\n| difluorobenzoxadiazole (ffBX)-based donor polymers |\n| PffBX - TT |\n| thieno[3,2 - b]thiophene |\n| benzodithiophene - based donor polymers |\n| fluoro - dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole |\n| PffBB - n (n = 10, 12, 14, or 16) |\n| PC71BM acceptor material |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| bi(alkyl-difluorothienyl)benzodithiophene-fluorobenzotriazole copolymer J91 |\n| branched alkyl chains                                             |\n| difluorobenzothiadiazole-quaterthiophene (PffBT4T) copolymer       |\n| fused thiophene spacers                                           |\n| difluorobenzoxadiazole (ffBX)-based donor polymers                |\n| benzodithiophene-based donor polymers with fluoro-dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole as an acceptor unit |\n| benzodithiophene (BDT) and difluorinated dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole-based donor polymer series PffBB-n (n = 10, 12, 14, or 16) |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| 11.63% |\n| 0.98 V |\n| 18.03 mA cm^-2 |\n| ∼ 780 nm |\n| ∼ 1.6 eV |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
