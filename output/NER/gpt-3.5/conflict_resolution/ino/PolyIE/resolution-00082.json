It is also understood that the 3 - fold higher chargecarrier mobility of PTATDPP than that of PTAFDPP arises from its stronger π - π stacking with a shorter d 010 , as discussed above . When the photovoltaic properties of copolymers are measured using PC71BM as an electron acceptor , it is found that the optimum blend ratio of polymer : PC71BM is 1 : 2 to afford the best PCE of both copolymers with the conventional device architecture of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al ( Fig . S2 and Table S1 † ) . The best PCE was also achieved when o - dichlorobenzene was used as a solvent and the optimum thickness for the active layer was ca . 90 nm . The current density - voltage ( J - V ) characteristics of the optimized solar cells are shown in Fig . 4 , and the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Tables 2 and S2 . † PTATDPP showed a best PCE of 6.69 % ( V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 12.3 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.68 ) , while PTAFDPP showed a best PCE of 5.02 % ( V OC = 0.76 V , J SC = 11.2 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.59 ) . Both copolymers showed higher V OC s than other DPP - based copolymers due to their low - lying HOMO energy levels . Both copolymers also exhibited high J SC s and FFs , indicating their decent ability for charge generation and transport . Therefore , the TA unit is a promising electron - donating unit for low band - gap copolymers with a low - lying HOMO energy level . When the PSC devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture ( ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag ) in order to further improve the photovoltaic performance , the PCEs of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP - based devices were improved to 7.02 % and 5.22 % , respectively ( Fig . 4b , Tables 2 and S2 † ) , mainly due to enhanced J SC s ( V OC s and FFs were not changed significantly ) . It is noteworthy here that the PCE of over 7 % of PTATDPP is the highest efficiency of anthracene - based low band - gap conjugated copolymers . In spite of the same band - gap of the two copolymers , PTATDPP shows slightly higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP ( Fig . S3 † ) . This can be ascribed to the closely packed microstructures of PTATDPP and thereby its high charge - carrier mobility than PTAFDPP . When the crystal structures of blend films of the copolymers with PC71BM were examined by XRD , the PTATDPP / PC71BM blend had strong and intense ( 100 ) diffraction while the PTAFDPP / PC71BM blend showed weak and broad ( 100 ) diffraction ( Fig . 2b ) .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name       |\n|---------------------|\n| copolymers          |\n| anthracene          |\n| DPP                 |\n| PTATDPP             |\n| PTAFDPP             |\n| PC71BM              |\n| ITO                 |\n| PEDOT               |\n| PSS                 |\n| Ca                  |\n| Al                  |\n| o-dichlorobenzene   |\n| V OC                |\n| J SC                |\n| FF                  |\n| HOMO                |\n| TA unit             |\n| low band-gap copolymers |\n| ZnO                 |\n| MoO3                |\n| Ag                  |\n| blend films         |\n| XRD                 |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                                                                                      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| hole mobilities                                                                                   |\n| crystallinity                                                                                     |\n| π-π stacking                                                                                      |\n| charge-carrier mobility                                                                           |\n| photovoltaic properties                                                                           |\n| blend ratio                                                                                       |\n| PCE                                                                                               |\n| current density-voltage characteristics                                                          |\n| photovoltaic parameters                                                                           |\n| low-lying HOMO energy levels                                                                      |\n| J_SC                                                                                              |\n| FF                                                                                                |\n| microstructures                                                                                   |\n| crystal structures                                                                                |\n| XRD                                                                                               |\n| V_OC                                                                                              |\n| electron acceptor                                                                                 |\n| solvent                                                                                           |\n| inverted architecture                                                                             |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| 6.69%          |\n| 5.02%          |\n| 0.80 V         |\n| 0.76 V         |\n| 12.3 mA cm^-2  |\n| 11.2 mA cm^-2  |\n| 0.68           |\n| 0.59           |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
