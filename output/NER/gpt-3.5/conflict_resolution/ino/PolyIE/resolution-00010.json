The optical band gaps of the polymers could be tuned from 1.41 eV to 1.61 eV by changing the number of thiophene spacers . Electrochemical measurements showed that the increase of band gap is mainly due to the change of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level . The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymer solar cells based on the three polymers and PC 70 BM reached 3.12 % with x = 2 under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . This approach could provide a simple strategy for designing high - performance D - A type photovoltaic polymers based on the existing polymers and a large potential to improve their performance further . â€  Electronic supplementary information ( ESI ) available : XRD patterns , DFT and TD - DFT calculations . See Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted much interest due to their great potential to be a renewable energy technology based on simple and low cost manufacture . [ 1][2][3 ] The concept of a bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) utilizing mixtures of a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative is regarded as an efficient system for photovoltaic application . 4 The most representative active layers of the blend of regioregular poly(3 - hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT ) with fullerene derivatives were extensively investigated . [ 5][6][7 ] While the advantage of P3HT is its simple structure with a relatively high hole mobility , the weak point of P3HT as the photovoltaic donor material towards efficient PSCs is the mismatch of its absorption spectrum ( absorption edge is about 650 nm ) with the terrestrial solar spectrum . The band gap of P3HT ( 1.9 eV ) is larger than the optimum band gap range ( 1.3 - 1.5 eV ) for polymer - fullerene BHJ solar cells . 8 Hence , design of photovoltaic polymers with broader absorption toward longer wavelengths , especially in the near - infrared ( NIR ) range , is necessary for high efficiency conjugated polymer donor materials . Thanks to the many attempts that have been made to develop NIR absorbing polymers , a notable improvement of the overall power - conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been achieved . [ 9][10][11 ] One of the most powerful and flexible strategies to design low band gap conjugated polymers involves an alternating sequence of electron - donor ( D ) and electron - acceptor ( A ) moieties along the conjugated polymer main chain .\n\nNER Response 1: Here is the table with the valid \"Material Name\" entities:\n\n| Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| DTP           |\n| BT            |\n| thiophene     |\n| PC 70 BM      |\n| P3HT          |\n\nThese are the material names mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name |\n|---------------|\n| Electron donating unit |\n| Electron accepting unit |\n| Number of thienyl spacers |\n| Number of thiophene spacers |\n| Electron acceptor material |\n| Fullerene derivative |\n| Conjugated polymer |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value       |\n|----------------------|\n| 1.41 eV - 1.61 eV    |\n| Not provided         |\n| 3.12%                |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
