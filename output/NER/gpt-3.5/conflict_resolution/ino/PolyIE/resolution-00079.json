The incorporation of an extended fused aromatic unit in the polymer backbone is expected to induce strong intermolecular interactions ( π - π stacking ) , affording high crystallinity to the polymer and thus resulting in a reduced energy barrier for charge carrier transport . Therefore , the DPP - based copolymers combined with fused heteroarenes have shown low band - gaps with excellent charge transport characteristics and thus a high short circuit current density ( J SC ) of the solar cell device . [ 26][27][28][29 ] However , since low band - gap DPP - based copolymers usually exhibit a relatively high - lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , leading to a low open circuit voltage ( V OC ) of PSCs , a compromise between the band - gap and the HOMO energy level of DPP - based polymers is critically required . One way to solve the trade - off between V OC and J SC of the PSC based on low band - gap polymers is to introduce arene groups which have weak electron - donating power . When a benzene or naphthalene group which has a weak electrondonating nature was incorporated into DPP - based copolymers , a low - lying HOMO energy level was achieved without a large sacrifice of the band - gap , and as a result PCEs were improved with enhanced V OC s as compared to the counterpart polymer with a strong electron - donating unit . 30,31 Anthracene is also an interesting building block as an electron - donating unit for low band - gap conjugated polymers , because the electron - donating power of anthracene is relatively weaker than fused heteroarenes such as thieno [ 3,2 - b]thiophene and dithieno[3,2 - b:2′,3′-d]thiophene , and therefore , anthracene - based copolymers are expected to have a low - lying HOMO energy level . Furthermore , anthracene - based copolymers usually exhibit high crystallinity and high charge carrier mobility due to the coplanar fused structure of the anthracene unit . Therefore , a combination of DPP and anthracene could be ideal , thus leading to high J SC and V OC . Nevertheless , a few studies have reported that anthracene - DPP conjugated polymers show low PCEs less than 3 % . 32 Here , we synthesized low band - gap copolymers incorporating 9,10 - bis ( 5-(2 - ethylhexyl)thiophen-2 - yl)anthracene ( TA ) and DPP as an electron - donating and electron - withdrawing unit , respectively . Very recently , we have successfully demonstrated that TA is a promising electron - donating moiety of medium band - gap conjugated copolymers for high performance polymer solar cells . 33 In conjunction with its weak electrondonating characteristics , TA possesses an extended conjugation in 2 - D , which is expected to enhance the light absorption and self - assembly of the resulting copolymer .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| fused heteroarenes |\n| DPP-based conjugated polymers |\n| extended fused aromatic unit |\n| polymer backbone |\n| DPP-based copolymers |\n| arene groups |\n| benzene |\n| naphthalene |\n| anthracene |\n| thieno[3,2-b]thiophene |\n| dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene |\n| anthracene-based copolymers |\n| anthracene-DPP conjugated polymers |\n| 9,10-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)anthracene (TA) |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                                            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Electron-donating units                                  |\n| Synthesis                                                |\n| Induce strong intermolecular interactions (π-π stacking) |\n| High crystallinity                                       |\n| Reduced energy barrier for charge carrier transport       |\n| Low band-gaps                                            |\n| Excellent charge transport characteristics              |\n| High short circuit current density (JSC) of the solar cell device |\n| Weak electron-donating power                             |\n| High charge carrier mobility                             |\n| Electron-donating moiety of medium band-gap conjugated copolymers |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| High crystallinity                                  |\n| Reduced energy barrier for charge carrier transport |\n| Low band-gap                                        |\n| High short circuit current density (JSC)            |\n| Relatively high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level |\n| Low open circuit voltage (VOC)                      |\n| Low-lying HOMO energy level                         |\n| Weak electron-donating power                        |\n| Low-lying HOMO energy level                         |\n| High crystallinity                                  |\n| High charge carrier mobility                        |\n| Low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs)            |\n| Medium band-gap                                     |\n| Extended conjugation in 2-D                         |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
