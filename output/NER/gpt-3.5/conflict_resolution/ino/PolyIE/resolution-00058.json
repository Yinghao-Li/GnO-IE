The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / LiF / Al , where the polymers ( P1- P7 ) were used as electron donors and PC71BM ( or PC61BM ) was used as an electron acceptor . To optimize the morphology and ordering structure , different volume percentages of 1,8diiodooctane were added . 43 Figure 4 shows the current density versus voltage ( J - V ) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW / cm^2 . The V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE values of the PSC devices are summarized in Table 3 . From P1 to P4 , PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor , but for P5 , P6 , and P7 , PC61BM was used as the electron acceptor . P5 , P6 , and P7 blended with PC61BM showed higher PCE values than when they were blended with PC71BM in spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , which is most likely due to the lower miscibility of those polymers with PC71BM . 44 The V OC of these random terpolymers increased in the order P2 ( 0.74 V ) âˆ¼ P3 ( 0.74 V ) < P4 ( 0.76 V ) < P5 ( 0.79 V ) < P6 ( 0.82 V ) . The trend in the V OC of the PSCs can be explained by the HOMO energy level of the polymers because the V OC is typically linearly proportional to the difference in energy between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor . 45 However , the PCE of the random terpolymers showed a the nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % in the order P3 ( 5.61 % ) > P4 ( 5.26 % ) > P2 ( 4.91 % ) > P5 ( 3.02 % ) > P6 ( 2.09 % ) ; this was consistent with the observed trend of the J SC . P3 exhibited the highest PCE value of 5.61 % among all polymers , including P1 and P7 , which was attributed to the broad absorption and increased V OC due to the deeper HOMO energy level .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name       |\n|---------------------|\n| polymers            |\n| ferrocene           |\n| ferrocenium         |\n| P1                  |\n| P7                  |\n| fullerene derivatives |\n| PC71BM              |\n| PC61BM              |\n| 1,8diiodooctane     |\n| random terpolymers  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                |\n|------------------------------|\n| onset oxidation potentials   |\n| onset reduction potentials   |\n| HOMO energy levels           |\n| LUMO energy levels           |\n| energy gap                   |\n| HOMO energy levels of P1-P7  |\n| LUMO energy levels of P1-P7  |\n| driving force                |\n| exciton dissociation         |\n| exciton binding energy       |\n| V OC                         |\n| J SC                         |\n| FF                           |\n| PCE                          |\n| electron acceptor            |\n| random terpolymers           |\n| deeper HOMO energy level     |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value                |\n|-------------------------------|\n| E onset ox                    |\n| E onset red                   |\n| -5                            |\n| E g CV                        |\n| E g OPT                       |\n| 4.80 eV below the vacuum level|\n| 38                            |\n| 41,42                         |\n| 43                            |\n| 44                            |\n| 0.74 V                        |\n| 0.76 V                        |\n| 0.79 V                        |\n| 0.82 V                        |\n| 5.61 %                        |\n| 5.26 %                        |\n| 4.91 %                        |\n| 3.02 %                        |\n| 2.09 %                        |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
