  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: Highly soluble poly[quinacridone - alt - benzothiadiazole ] ( PQCDTB ) has been synthesized through the Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing planar quinacridone and highly absorbing benzothiadiazole . The PQCDTB dissolved in general organic solvents , and the M n was 49.8 kg / mol . The optical band gap energy was 1.92 eV , which was similar to the band gap of benzothiadiazole . The HOMO and LUMO levels of PQCDTB were -5.24 eV and -3.32 eV , respectively . According to the XRD measurement , PQCDTB showed the formation of ordered lamellar structure as an out - of - plane peak ( h00 ) by the alkyl side chain of quinacridone and conventional edge - on πstacking . This study also evaluated the OPV characteristics by fabricating a bulk - heterojunction - type polymer solar cell . When PQCDTB and PC71BM were fabricated in a 1 : 1 weight ratio , the open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short - circuit current ( J SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8 % and 2.5 % , respectively . In particular , PQCDTB exhibited higher FFs compared with poly[carbazole - alt - benzothiadiazole ] ( PCZDTB ) . For the past several decades , semiconducting polymers have been applied to various sectors , such as organic light emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , 1 - 4 organic photovoltaic cells ( OPVs ) 5 - 9 and organic thin film transistors ( OTFTs ) . 10 - 13 Of these applications , OPVs have become mainstream , thanks to their outstanding economic feasibility and sustainable development . Nevertheless , a low power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been the largest obstacle in OPVs . 6 To improve the PCE , the following idealistic conditions are required in conjugated polymers : 14 ( 1 ) a low bandgap with a wide absorption area , ( 2 ) a crystalline structure to produce good charge transport characteristics , ( 3 ) a low highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level to produce a high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and ( 4 ) an appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level for effective electron charge transfer to fullerene . To acquire good charge transport characteristics , it is necessary to increase the close packing among polymers through the reduction of energetic disorder by increasing the coplanarity and the interchain π - π interaction . In the Janssen group , a copolymer containing terthiophene was reported , which shows an increase in planarity packing and high mobility characteristics , and a diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative showed a PCE of 4.7 % and a high hole mobility ( 0.04 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ) . 15 In the Jen group , a hole mobility of 0.029 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 and a PCE of 6.2 % were reported in a copolymer that contained an indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) unit and a phenanthrenequinoxaline unit .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| poly[quinacridone - alt - benzothiadiazole] |\n| PQCDTB |\n| quinacridone |\n| benzothiadiazole |\n| PC71BM |\n| poly[carbazole - alt - benzothiadiazole] |\n| terthiophene |\n| diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative |\n| indacenodithiophene (IDT) |\n| phenanthrenequinoxaline unit |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Highly soluble                                     |\n| Planar                                             |\n| Highly absorbing                                   |\n| General organic solvents                           |\n| Optical band gap energy                            |\n| HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) level     |\n| LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level    |\n| Ordered lamellar structure                         |\n| Alkyl side chain                                   |\n| Conventional edge-on π-stacking                    |\n| Open-circuit voltage (V OC)                         |\n| Short-circuit current (J SC)                        |\n| Fill factor (FF)                                   |\n| Power conversion efficiency (PCE)                   |\n| Bandgap                                            |\n| Wide absorption area                               |\n| Crystalline structure                              |\n| Charge transport characteristics                   |\n| Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level |\n| Open-circuit voltage (V oc)                         |\n| Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level |\n| Effective electron charge transfer                 |\n| Coplanarity                                        |\n| Interchain π-π interaction                         |\n| Terthiophene                                       |\n| Planarity packing                                  |\n| High mobility characteristics                     |\n| Diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative                    |\n| Indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit                      |\n| Phenanthrenequinoxaline unit                        |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| 49.8 kg/mol    |\n| 1.92 eV        |\n| -5.24 eV       |\n| -3.32 eV       |\n| 0.79 V         |\n| 5.6 mA cm^-2   |\n| 55.8%          |\n| 2.5%           |\n\nHere is the table with the valid entities representing material property values, presented precisely as in the original paragraph.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
