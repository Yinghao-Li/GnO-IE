's estimation . 52 3.4 . Photovoltaic Performance Measurements . Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using polymer : PC 70 BM blend films . The polymer : PC 70 BM blends were dissolved in a mixed solvent containing chlorobenzene ( CB ) and 1,8 - diiodooctane ( DIO ) in a volume ratio of 97 : 3 . The solutions were spincoated onto PEDOT : PSS - coated ITO substrates . A thin TiO 2 nanoparticle layer was then spin - coated onto the blend film , followed by aluminum evaporation . Devices prepared using either polymer showed the best performances for a polymer : PC 70 BM blend ratio of 1 : 2 . The solar cell properties were measured under AM1.5 G illumination , and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2 . The current density - voltage curves are shown in Figure 4a . POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices displayed reasonable open - circuit voltages ( V oc ) of 0.70 and 0.72 V , respectively , considering their HOMO levels , -5.23 and -5.37 eV , respectively . The POBDTPD device exhibited a short - circuit current ( J sc ) of 10.6 mA cm^-2 , whereas the PEBDTPD device showed a J sc of 13.5 mA cm^-2 . The fill factor ( FF ) values were 0.64 and 0.54 for the POBDTPD and the PEBDTPD devices , respectively . As a result , the PCEs were 4.7 % and 5.3 % for the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices , respectively . The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra were also measured ( Figure 4b ) . A high EQE response of greater than 50 % over the range 400- 550 nm was observed for both polymer devices . The EQEs were higher for the PEBDTPD device in the 550 - 900 nm range , partly because the PEBDTPD polymer has a higher light absorption at long wavelengths ( Figure 1a ) , which is consistent with the higher J sc values in the PEBDTPD device . To understand the reasons of the higher J sc and the lower FF in the PEBDTPD device , as compared with the POBDTPD device more specifically , we investigated film morphology , exciton separation , and carrier mobility in the polymer films and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films . First , film morphology was Figure 6 shows the PL spectra of the polymers and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films spin - coated from CB solutions or CB solutions containing 3 vol % DIO additives . Both the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers displayed PL with a peak around 990 nm . Blending polymers with PC 70 BMs , especially with an aid of the DIO additive , significantly quenched PL . This effective PL quenching suggested that the exciton separation was highly efficient in both the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name    |\n|------------------|\n| polymer          |\n| PC 70 BM         |\n| chlorobenzene (CB) |\n| 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) |\n| PEDOT:PSS        |\n| ITO              |\n| TiO2             |\n| aluminum         |\n| POBDTPD          |\n| PEBDTPD          |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                   |\n|---------------------------------|\n| HOMO levels                     |\n| LUMO levels                     |\n| band gaps                       |\n| polymer                         |\n| PC 70 BM blend films            |\n| chlorobenzene (CB)              |\n| 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)          |\n| mixed solvent                   |\n| volume ratio                    |\n| PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates |\n| TiO2 nanoparticle layer         |\n| aluminum                        |\n| photovoltaic parameters         |\n| current density-voltage curves  |\n| open-circuit voltages (Voc)     |\n| J sc (short-circuit current)    |\n| fill factor (FF)                |\n| PCEs (power conversion efficiencies) |\n| external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra |\n| film morphology                 |\n| exciton separation              |\n| carrier mobility                |\n| PL spectra                      |\n| DIO additives                   |\n| effective PL quenching          |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value       |\n|----------------------|\n| -5.23 eV             |\n| -5.37 eV             |\n| 0.70 V               |\n| 0.72 V               |\n| 10.6 mA cm^-2        |\n| 13.5 mA cm^-2        |\n| 0.64                 |\n| 0.54                 |\n| 4.7%                 |\n| 5.3%                 |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
