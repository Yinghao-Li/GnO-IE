  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: their ter - polymers containing perylene units were synthesized using Suzuki coupling polymerization . The perylene units were introduced to improve the charge - transport ability by enhancing the π - π interaction between polymer chains . The resulting polymers were characterized by 1H NMR , elemental analysis , DSC , and TGA . The synthesized polymers were soluble in common organic solvents , and formed smooth and uniform spin - coated thin films . All of the polymers studied were found to exhibit good thermal stability , losing less than 5 % of their weight upon heating to approximately 350 ° C. Perylene - containing polymers showed higher field - effect mobilities than the corresponding PFDTBT or PFD2TBT polymers because of the enhanced π - π interaction between polymer chains upon the introduction of perylene units . Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al . The devices using the perylene - containing polymers showed higher short - circuit currents , and fill factors than the corresponding PFDTBT or PFD2TBT devices . One of the fabricated devices using a perylene - containing copolymer showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.16 % , with a short circuit current density of 9.61 mA / cm^2 , open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , and fill factor of 41 % . Extensive research has been carried out during the past decade on bulk heterojunction solar cells that utilize organic semiconducting materials . 1 The main advantages of organic photovoltaic devices ( OPVs ) are their lightweight , flexible nature , and their cost - effective manufacture by various printing technologies . The photoconversion process in OPVs is accomplished by efficient light absorption by conjugated polymers and accepting materials , charge separation at the interface of the donor polymer and the accepting materials , and subsequent charge collection at the electrodes . Matching the absorption of the conjugated polymer to the solar spectrum determines the ultimate performance of the solar cell . Among the variety of conjugated polymers that have been studied , poly(p - phenylenevinylene ) ( PPV ) , 2 poly(alkylfluorene ) ( PF ) , and polythiophene ( PT ) 3 derivatives are typical p - type electron donor materials . However , the performance of photovoltaic cells with these polymers is limited by their relatively large band gap energies , which are not yet optimized with respect to the solar spectrum . Therefore , the design and synthesis of new low - band gap polymers become very important to better harvest the solar spectrum , especially in the red and near - infrared ranges , which can lead to possible enhancements in the photocurrents of OPVs . 4 The most widely used approach for obtaining low - band gap structures is to utilize internal charge transfer ( ICT ) from an electron - donating to an electron - accepting moiety . 5 - 7 Some interesting structures using the ICT approach have been reported .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|--------------|\n| ter-polymers |\n| perylene units |\n| polymer chains |\n| polymers |\n| organic solvents |\n| spin-coated thin films |\n| PFDTBT |\n| PFD2TBT |\n| ITO |\n| PEDOT:PSS |\n| PC71BM |\n| TiOx |\n| Al |\n| copolymer |\n| conjugated polymers |\n| accepting materials |\n| donor polymer |\n| PPV |\n| PF |\n| PT |\n| low-band gap polymers |\n| electron-donating moiety |\n| electron-accepting moiety |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                |\n|------------------------------|\n| ter-polymers                 |\n| perylene units               |\n| charge-transport ability     |\n| π-π interaction              |\n| resulting polymers           |\n| common organic solvents      |\n| spin-coated thin films       |\n| thermal stability            |\n| field-effect mobilities      |\n| PFDTBT or PFD2TBT polymers   |\n| bulk heterojunction solar cells |\n| short-circuit currents       |\n| fill factors                 |\n| power conversion efficiency  |\n| short circuit current density |\n| open circuit voltage         |\n| fill factor                  |\n| organic semiconducting materials |\n| lightweight                  |\n| flexible nature              |\n| cost-effective manufacture   |\n| printing technologies        |\n| photoconversion process      |\n| conjugated polymers          |\n| accepting materials          |\n| charge separation            |\n| donor polymer                |\n| electrodes                   |\n| absorption                   |\n| solar spectrum               |\n| band gap energies            |\n| red and near-infrared ranges |\n| enhancements                 |\n| photocurrents                |\n| low-band gap polymers        |\n| internal charge transfer (ICT) |\n| electron-donating moiety     |\n| electron-accepting moiety    |\n\nHere is the table with the valid entities as requested.\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| Less than 5% weight loss upon heating to approximately 350 °C |\n| Higher in perylene-containing polymers compared to PFDTBT or PFD2TBT polymers |\n| Higher in perylene-containing polymers compared to PFDTBT or PFD2TBT polymers |\n| Maximum of 3.16% in a device using a perylene-containing copolymer |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
