The less balanced carrier transport in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film accounts for the lower FF . The polymers and polymer blend films were also analyzed by X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) studies . Figure 8 shows the XRD patterns of the polymers and the polymer : PC 70 BM blends . All film XRD results were similar and showed weak crystalline features with a broad peak around 23 ° . The crystalline features corresponding to π - stacking among the conjugated polymer backbones were also observed among TT - based polymers ; 25 however , the peaks were broader , and no crystalline peaks were observed at smaller angles around 4.4 ° . This less crystalline feature was possibly caused by the more twisted polymer backbones , as compared to PTB7 or PBDTTPD polymer backbones . In conclusion , we synthesized the low band gap POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers that consist of dialkoxybenzodithiophene ( BDT ) as the donor and N - octyl-2,7 - dithia-5azacyclopenta[a]pentalene-4,6 - dione ( DTPD ) as the acceptor . The DTPD acceptor moieties allow the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers to have a low band gap ( ∼ 900 nm ) and optimal HOMO and LUMO levels alignment for PSCs , yielding the PCEs of 4.7 and 5.3 % , respectively . In this study , we demonstrate , for the first time , that the DTPD unit is a promising electron - withdrawing building block for low band gap polymers , and it can be utilized to tailor the optical and electronic properties of conjugated polymers for photovoltaic devices and many other applications in plastic electronics .\n\nNER Response 1: Here is the Markdown table with the valid \"Material Name\" entities from the paragraph:\n\n| Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| POBDTPD       |\n| PC 70 BM      |\n| PEBDTPD       |\n| TT-based polymers |\n| PTB7          |\n| PBDTTPD       |\n| dialkoxybenzodithiophene (BDT) |\n| N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5azacyclopenta[a]pentalene-4,6-dione (DTPD) |\n| PSCs (Photovoltaic Solar Cells) |\n\nPlease note that the table includes only the entities that clearly refer to material names as mentioned in the original paragraph.\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name |\n|---------------|\n| Hole and electron mobilities |\n| Ratios between hole and electron mobilities |\n| Carrier transport |\n| Lower FF |\n| Crystalline features |\n| π-stacking |\n| Band gap |\n| HOMO and LUMO levels alignment |\n| PCEs |\n| Optical and electronic properties |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|---------------|\n| 3.2           |\n| 13.6          |\n| lower FF      |\n| broad peak around 23° |\n| no crystalline peaks observed at smaller angles around 4.4° |\n| low band gap (∼ 900 nm) |\n| 4.7%          |\n| 5.3%          |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
