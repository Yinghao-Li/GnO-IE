In this regard , a simple and effective method might be to tune the properties of D - A type photovoltaic polymers by introducing thienyl groups as spacers between donor and acceptor segments in the backbone . In this study , three kinds of low band gap copolymers integrating DTP as the donor block and the most - used BT as the acceptor unit were synthesized . Different numbers of thienyl ( T ) as spacers were introduced along the copolymer main chain to investigate the effect on optical , electrochemical and photovoltaic performance . [ 6,6]-Phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) was used as an acceptor in the blended film of copolymers : PC 70 BM . Different solvents ( chlorobenzene ( CB ) and 1,2 - dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) ) were tested to build an optimized interpenetrated network in the active film , and the corresponding film properties and the photovoltaic device performance are discussed in detail . Fig . 1 shows the optical absorption spectra of PDTP - BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT in CHCl 3 solution and in thin films spin - coated on quartz plates . The absorption maximum wavelength in the solutions and the films and the optical band gap deduced from the absorption onsets are summarized in Table 1 . Judging from the splitting of the absorption bands , it can be speculated that the polymers have the typical absorption characteristics of D - A type copolymers with π - π * and charge transfer - type transitions . Comparing the polymers PDTP - BT and PDTP - DT2BT with the previously synthesized polymer PDTP - DTBT , 27 the difference in their absorption is distinct . The PDTP - DTBT solution showed two prominent absorption maxima at 450 and 671 nm , while PDTP - BT and PDTP - DT2BT solutions demonstrated two main absorption maxima at 413 and 711 nm and at 480 and 603 nm , respectively . Although the absorption peaks in the Scheme 1 Synthetic route of three dithienopyrrole - based donor - acceptor type copolymers with thienyl spacers . long wavelength blue - shifted by 40 nm and 108 nm with insertion of one and two thienyl spacers to PDTP - BT , the absorption coefficients at the absorption maxima increase from 3.6 × 10 ^ 4 ( PDTP - BT ) to 4.0 × 10 ^ 4 ( PDTP - DTBT ) and 4.7 × 10 ^ 4 L mol^-1 cm^-1 ( PDTP - DT2BT ) , respectively . In thin films , the three copolymers exhibit similar shapes and red - shifted absorption spectra compared with those in the solutions , which indicates stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid state .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name       |\n|---------------------|\n| DTP                 |\n| DTBT                |\n| thienyl             |\n| copolymers          |\n| BT                  |\n| thienyl groups      |\n| low band gap copolymers |\n| PC 70 BM            |\n| chlorobenzene       |\n| 1,2-dichlorobenzene |\n| PDTP - BT           |\n| PDTP - DTBT         |\n| PDTP - DT2BT        |\n| CHCl 3              |\n| quartz plates       |\n| dithienopyrrole     |\n| thin films          |\n| solid state         |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name |\n|---------------|\n| π - π stacking intermolecular interactions |\n| charge carrier mobility |\n| ordered structure |\n| polymer main chain |\n| thienyl units |\n| thienyl groups |\n| thienyl (T) spacers |\n| interpenetrated network |\n| active film |\n| thin films |\n| absorption maximum wavelength |\n| optical band gap |\n| absorption onsets |\n| π - π * and charge transfer - type transitions |\n| absorption peaks |\n| absorption coefficients |\n| L mol^-1 cm^-1 |\n| solid state |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value       |\n|----------------------|\n| 14                   |\n| 27                   |\n| 37                   |\n| 450                  |\n| 671                  |\n| 413                  |\n| 711                  |\n| 480                  |\n| 603                  |\n| 40                   |\n| 108                  |\n| 3.6 × 10^4 L mol^-1 cm^-1 |\n| 4.0 × 10^4 L mol^-1 cm^-1 |\n| 4.7 × 10^4 L mol^-1 cm^-1 |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
