  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: According to the equation E LUMO = E HOMO + E g , opt , the LUMO energy level of PSFDTBT was calculated to be -3.43 eV. The LUMO energy level of PSFDTBT is positioned about 0.80 eV above that of PC71BM ( 4.2 eV , measured under the same condition ) , which offers enough driving force for charge separation and transfer without too much energy loss . 5,17 Transport Properties . The transport properties of the polymer were investigated by fabricating organic thin film fieldeffect transistors ( OFETs ) . Typical p - channel field - effect transistor behavior was obtained . The hole mobility ( μ ) was estimated in the saturated regime from the derivative plots of the square root of source - drain current ( I SD ) versus gate voltage ( V G ) through equation 2 where W is the channel width , L is the channel length , C i is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer ( SiO 2 , 500 nm , C i = 7.5 nF / cm^2 ) , and V T is the threshold voltage . The output ( a ) and transfer characteristics ( b ) of the spin - coated PSFDTBT films are shown in Figure 2 . The hole mobility of the pristine PSFDTBT film spin - cast from DCB solution is 7.26 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10 ^ 5 , which is almost two orders higher than that of P1 ( the hole mobility of pure P1 film is 2 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) . 8 Such comparable high mobility is beneficial for charge transfer in the resulting PSCs . 5 For the PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend film ( in a weight ratio of 1 : 3 , spin - coated from ODCB solutions ) , hole mobility ( μ hole ) of 1.14 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and electron mobility ( μ e ) of 2.7 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 were obtained . I SD = ( W / 2L)C i μ(V G - V T ) Photovoltaic Properties . Broad absorption , appropriate HOMO / LUMO positions , and comparable hole mobility make PSFDTBT a promising donor material in BHJ PSCs . Therefore , the photovoltaic performance of PSFDTBT was investigated in PSCs . Polymer solar cells with a device configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al were fabricated and characterized under the illumination of AM1.5 G ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) . The weight ratio of PSFDTBT to PC71BM and the processing solvent have been carefully optimized . The results are summarized in Table 1 . Using DCB as the processing solvent , four polymer solar cells with blends of PSFDTBT and PC71BM in weight ratios of 1 : 2.5 , 1 : 3 , 1 : 3.5 , and 1 : 4 , respectively , as the active layer were fabricated , and their J - V curves are shown in Figure 3a . In all cases , PCEs of about 4.1 % were obtained .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|--------------|\n| PSFDTBT      |\n| PC71BM       |\n| P1           |\n| DCB          |\n| ODCB         |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name |\n|---------------|\n| PSFDTBT       |\n| PC71BM        |\n| SiO2          |\n| DCB           |\n| ODCB          |\n| ITO           |\n| PEDOT:PSS     |\n| LiF           |\n| Al            |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| -3.43 eV       |\n| 4.2 eV         |\n| 7.26 × 10^-3 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1 |\n| 2.7 × 10^-4 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1 |\n| about 4.1%     |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
