  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: Such a superior device performance is the result of the highest J sc and FF achieved ( Table 3 ) when using 80 ° C as a spin - coating temperature compared to those fabricated at 60 or 100 ° C. The decrease in both the J sc and FF could be due to inferior polymer chain packing in the active layer leading to a poor charge transporting network . Besides , the device performance generally varied with the length of alkyl side chains attached onto the polymer backbone . The device efficiency initially increases upon the incorporation of longer alkyl side chains from decyl to tetradecyl reaching a maximum at tetradecyl - substituted PffBB-14 and then declines with further alkyl side chain extension . Importantly , such chain Article length - dependent device performance trend is spin - coating temperature independent . The champion PffBB-14 - based device affords the highest PCE of 9.93 % with a V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36 % . The size of the alkyl side chain is known to affect the processability and interchain interactions of a polymer , which would provide a tool to optimize the π - π stacking interactions of a polymer in the solid state . A size - optimized alkyl side chain would provide a good balance between the π - π stacking interactions of the polymer backbone and the alkyl - alkyl side chain interactions resulting in a highly ordered molecular packing for efficient charge transport . Figure 5a shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of PffBB - n / PC71BM - based PSCs . Strong and broad photo - to - current responses were observed in the range from 330 to 780 nm in all of these PSCs , in which the absorption above 650 nm was attributed to the polymer aggregationinduced absorption broadening . Remarkably , the PffBB-14based device exhibited a much higher photoconversion Article response ranging from 350 to 500 nm than those of other devices , thus affording the highest J sc among all of these devices . As PffBB - n polymers showed similar absorption properties , the high current density of PffBB-14 - based PSC would result from well - ordered polymer : PC71BMnetwork / packing . J sc derived from the EQE spectra were estimated to be 14.12 , 14.92 , 16.29 , and 14.21 mA cm^-2 for PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based devices , respectively , which were in good agreement with those obtained from J - V characterization ( Figure 6 ) . Charge Transfer and Recombination . The charge carrier mobilities of PffBB - n - based devices were estimated on hole - only and electron - only devices using the space - chargelimited current ( SCLC ) model , and the results are summarized in Table 4 . Indeed , the highest and well - balanced charge carrier mobility of the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend affords a higher J sc and FF than those of other devices . Charge dissociation probability was characterized by photogenerated current density ( J ph ) vs effective applied voltage ( V eff ) measurements .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name                |\n|------------------------------|\n| J sc                         |\n| FF                           |\n| spin-coating temperature     |\n| polymer chain                |\n| active layer                 |\n| alkyl side chains            |\n| polymer backbone             |\n| PffBB-14                     |\n| alkyl side chain extension   |\n| PCE                          |\n| V oc                         |\n| mA cm^-2                     |\n| FF                           |\n| alkyl side chain             |\n| π - π stacking interactions |\n| solid state                  |\n| PC71BM                       |\n| polymer aggregation-induced absorption broadening |\n| J sc                         |\n| polymer: PC71BM network/packing |\n| EQE spectra                  |\n| J - V characterization       |\n| charge carrier mobilities    |\n| SCLC model                   |\n| PffBB-14: PC71BM blend       |\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                            |\n|------------------------------------------|\n| J sc                                     |\n| FF                                       |\n| spin-coating temperature                 |\n| polymer chain packing                    |\n| charge transporting network              |\n| alkyl side chains                        |\n| polymer backbone                         |\n| device efficiency                        |\n| alkyl side chain extension               |\n| PffBB-14                                 |\n| PCE                                      |\n| V oc                                     |\n| mA cm^-2                                 |\n| EQE                                      |\n| PC71BM                                   |\n| polymer aggregation-induced absorption broadening |\n| polymer: PC71BM network/packing          |\n| J-V characterization                     |\n| charge carrier mobilities                |\n| SCLC                                     |\n| J ph                                     |\n| V eff                                    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value       |\n|----------------------|\n| J sc: 16.77 mA cm^-2 |\n| FF: 64.36%           |\n| V oc: 0.92 V         |\n| PCE: 9.93%           |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
