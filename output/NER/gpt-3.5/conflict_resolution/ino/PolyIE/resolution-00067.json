Since the open - circuit voltage V oc of bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs is positively correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , a higher V oc for PzNDTDTBObased polymer solar cells could be anticipated due to the lowerlying HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO . 24 Photovoltaic Properties . To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the NDT - based semiconductor , PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated . Figure 5 shows the current density - voltage characteristic of PSCs based on the blends of polymer : PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5 G , 100 mW cm^-2 . To further study the performance of the PSC devices , the hole mobilities in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method using devices with structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au at the optimized blend ratio of polymer / PC71BM . For unipolar transport in a trap - free semiconductor with an ohmic injecting contact , the SCLC can be approximated by the Mott - Gurney equation : ε ε μ γ ≅ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ J V L V L 9 ^ 8 exp 0.891 r 0 ^ 0 2 ^ 3 ( 3 ) Here J is the current density , ε r is the dielectric constant of the polymer , ε 0 is the free - space permittivity ( 8.85 × 10 ^ -12 F / m ) , μ 0 is the charge mobility at zero field , γ is a constant , L is the thickness of the blended film layer , V = V appl - V bi , V appl is the applied potential , and V bi is the built - in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode ( in this device structure , V bi = 0.2 V ) . Figure 6 displays the ln(JL 3 / V 2 ) vs ( V / L ) 0.5 curve for the measurement of the hole mobility of the blend films of PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) and PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM ( 1.5 : 1 , w / w ) by the SCLC method . According to eq 3 , the hole mobilities obtained are as high as 3.3 × 10 ^ -3 and 4.4 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO , respectively . Obviously , from the viewpoint of hole mobility , PzNDTDTBO is more suitable ( higher than 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) for the application as photovoltaic donor materials in PSCs .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| PzNDTDTBO     |\n| PzNDTDTBT     |\n| BT            |\n| BO            |\n| polymer       |\n| PC71BM        |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name |\n|--------------|\n| HOMO energy level |\n| PzNDTDTBO |\n| PzNDTDTBT |\n| BT unit |\n| BO unit |\n| oxygen atom |\n| sulfur atom |\n| open-circuit voltage (Voc) |\n| LUMO energy level |\n| acceptor |\n| donor polymer |\n| bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs |\n| Voc |\n| PzNDTDTBO-based polymer solar cells |\n| NDT-based semiconductor |\n| polymer |\n| PC71BM |\n| hole mobilities |\n| photosensitive layers |\n| space charge limited current (SCLC) method |\n| trap-free semiconductor |\n| Mott-Gurney equation |\n| dielectric constant |\n| charge mobility |\n| thickness of the blended film layer |\n| built-in potential |\n| work function |\n| anode |\n| cathode |\n| hole mobility |\n| blend films |\n| viewpoint of hole mobility |\n| photovoltaic donor materials |\n| PSCs |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| 0.15 eV lower than that of PzNDTDTBT |\n| higher than that of PzNDTDTBT |\n| 3.3 × 10^-3 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1 |\n| 4.4 × 10^-2 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1 |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
