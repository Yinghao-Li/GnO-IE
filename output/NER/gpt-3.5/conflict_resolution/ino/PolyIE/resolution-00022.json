The intrinsic properties of PCDSeBT are not only characterized by UV - vis absorption , cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) , and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) but also the surface morphology , mobilities of space charge - limited current ( SCLC ) model , and polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) in its bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) active layer with [ 6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) are evaluated in detail . It is found that PCDSeBT simultaneously has a low - lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level at -5.4 eV and a low bandgap of 1.70 eV as required by the ideal polymers for BHJ PSCs . The high current of 11.7 mA / cm^2 is obtained for PCDSeBT - based PSCs , to our knowledge , which is among the highest short - circuit current density ( J SC ) values obtained from a BHJ device consisting of PCDTBT derivatives and [ 6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) . The high J SC value , along with a moderate fill factor ( FF ) of 45 % and a high open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.79 V , yields a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 4.12 % , which is about 37 % increase in PCE from a PCDTBT - based reference device . On the basis of our results , one can be concluded that the DSeBT placement for construction of donor ( D)-acceptor ( A ) polymers is an easy and effective way to realize both the higher J SC and V OC values in PSCs , as a consequence of the selective lower - lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) with the HOMO being almost unchanged , together with the effective broadening on the absorption band . With deep understanding of efficient photoinduced electron transfer within an interpenetrating network by simple blending π - conjugated polymers ( electron donor ) with fullerene derivatives ( electron acceptor ) , 1 bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on poly(3 - hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT ) : [ 6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) have been extensively investigated , leading to great progress in power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of 4 - 5 % . 2 Yet , the PCE of P3HT - based PSCs is limited by its relatively large bandgap ( ∼ 1.9 eV ) with major loss of the solar radiation as well as low open circuit - voltage ( V OC ≅ 0.6 V ) due to the relatively small energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of P3HT and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of PCBM .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|\n| PCDTBT                                             |\n| PCDSeBT                                            |\n| diselenienylbenzothiadiazole (DSeBT)                |\n| [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) |\n| PCDTBT derivatives                                 |\n| [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)   |\n| poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)                       |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|\n| PCDTBT - based polymer solar cells (PSCs)           |\n| PCDSeBT                                            |\n| diselenienylbenzothiadiazole (DSeBT)                |\n| [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) |\n| [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)   |\n| poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)                       |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| -5.4 eV        |\n| 1.70 eV        |\n| 11.7 mA/cm^2   |\n| highest        |\n| 45%            |\n| 0.79 V         |\n| 4.12%          |\n| 37%            |\n| 1.9 eV         |\n| 0.6 V          |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
