  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: 23,24 In addition , the comparison of random terpolymers with different compositions to their parent polymers has been rarely explored ; 25 such studies are critical for understanding the compositional effect of random terpolymers on the device performance , in terms of charge generation , transport , and structural properties . The combination of the different electron - deficient units of pyrrolo [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione ( DPP ) and thieno [ 3,4- c]pyrrole-4,6 - dione ( TPD ) can be ideal for producing broad light absorption due to the large difference between their electron - withdrawing strengths . 19,22 In addition , both units have been successfully used in D - A copolymers to produce high - performance PSCs . 26 - 33 While electron - withdrawing TPD possesses a relatively simple , symmetric , and planar structure suitable for D - A copolymers in PSCs , DPP exhibits very strong electron - withdrawing effect due to the presence of electrondeficient lactam rings and strong π - π interactions . 19,34 Herein , we report a series of novel random poly[thienyl - substituted benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene - pyrrolo [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4dione - thieno [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-4,6 - dione]copolymers ( PBDTT- DPP - TPD ) based on one electron - rich unit , thienylsubstituted benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene ( BDTT ) , and two electron - deficient units , DPP and TPD , that have complementary and broad light absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm . This is a much broader absorption than other reported random terpolymers , 23,24 endowing a great potential for improving the PSC performance and providing an ideal system for studying the compositional effect of the random terpolymers on the PSC performance . While the ratio of DPP to TPD influenced the optical behavior of the random terpolymers , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymers showed a nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % . The best PCE value of 6.33 % was obtained from the blend device of PBDTT - DPP75 - TPD25 and [ 6,6]-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) , with a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) higher than 16 mA / cm^2 . To understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the PCE , the optical , electrical , and structural properties of these random terpolymers with different ratios of DPP to TPD were systematically investigated . stated , all of the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received . The weight - average molecular weight ( M w ) , number - average molecular weight ( M n ) , and polydispersity index ( PDI ) of P1- P7 were measured by SEC with o - dichlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 ° C. The characteristics of the polymers are summarized in Table 1 . To determine the actual ratio between DPP and TPD in the random terpolymers , they were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . The 1H NMR spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure S1 . The peak of the butyloctyl chains adjacent to the lactam N atom of DPP appeared around 4.09 ppm and the signal of the octyl chains adjacent to TPD appeared around 3.77 ppm .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|---------------|\n| DPP           |\n| TPD           |\n| PBDTT-DPP-TPD |\n| BDTT          |\n| PC71BM        |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name |\n|---------------|\n| Random terpolymers |\n| Parent polymers |\n| Device performance |\n| Charge generation |\n| Transport |\n| Structural properties |\n| Electron-deficient units |\n| Pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) |\n| Thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) |\n| Broad light absorption |\n| Electron-withdrawing strengths |\n| D-A copolymers |\n| PSCs (Polymer Solar Cells) |\n| Simple, symmetric, and planar structure |\n| Electron-deficient lactam rings |\n| Strong π-π interactions |\n| Random poly[thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione] copolymers (PBDTT-DPP-TPD) |\n| Electron-rich unit |\n| Thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) |\n| Complementary and broad light absorption |\n| Power conversion efficiency (PCE) |\n| Ratio of DPP to TPD |\n| Blend device |\n| [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) |\n| Short-circuit current density (JSC) |\n| Optical behavior |\n| Weight-average molecular weight (Mw) |\n| Number-average molecular weight (Mn) |\n| Polydispersity index (PDI) |\n| 1H NMR spectroscopy |\n| Elemental analysis |\n| Butyloctyl chains |\n| Octyl chains |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value |\n|----------------|\n| 400 to 900 nm |\n| Nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6% |\n| Measured by SEC with o-dichlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 °C |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
