A new series of PBDTT - DPP - TPD random terpolymers containing two different electron - deficient units ( DPP and TPD ) were synthesized to produce polymers with complementary and broad light absorption from 400 to 900 nm . Through the variation of DPP to TPD composition in the polymers , we successfully tuned the frontier energy levels and illustrated the benefits of this approach in relation to PSC device performance . The optimal ratio of 75 : 25 between DPP and TPD in the random terpolymers enhanced the efficiency of P3 : PC71BM , exhibiting 6.33 % due to improved light absorption and thus a J SC value higher than 16 mA / cm^2 . In contrast , P5 and P6 with higher TPD contents of 75 and 90 % , respectively , exhibited PCE values of 2 - 3 % , which are significantly lower than those observed for P1 and P7 . We found that the optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers could not solely explain this nonlinear compositional dependence . Therefore , we developed a quantitative understanding of the polymer packing structure and the electrical properties using GIXS and DFT , respectively . The DFT calculation results revealed that incorporation of two electron - deficient units changes the electron distribution in the polymer backbone , thus affecting the charge transfer in the PSCs . Consequently , these findings suggest that the design and synthesis of new random terpolymers is a promising way to broaden the absorption of their parent polymers and that optimization of the composition of random terpolymers is critically important to maximize the PSC performance . â–  ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Materials and methods , detailed experimental procedures , and additional data .
