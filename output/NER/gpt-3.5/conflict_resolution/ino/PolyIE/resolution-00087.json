  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: Their corresponding UV absorption data are listed in Table 2 . In DCM solution , PBDT - TDPP - S shows two obvious absorption peaks . The first one at ∼ 420 nm corresponds to the π - π * transition of the polymeric backbone in short wavelength region . The second one at ∼ 590 nm in long wavelength region is attributed to the ICT interaction between the donor unit in the main chain and the acceptor unit at the side chain . Compared with the absorption spectrum in DCM solution , the one in solid film displayed a red - shift absorption peak at 602 nm and an additional shoulder at 655 nm besides the highenergy peak . The extended absorption edge in long wavelength region can be attributed to the more aggregated configuration formed in solid state . Compared to the main - chain copolymer of PBDTDPP - OR reported by the Jo group , this side - chain copolymer of PBDT - TDPP - S exhibited a 100 nm blue - shifted maximum absorption peak . The observed blue - shifted absorption phenomenon should be related to the less planar conformation and weaker D - A interaction for the side - chain D - A copolymer than the main - chain D - A copolymer . As a result , the optical band gap ( E g opt ) of PBDT - TDPP - S was shifted to 1.73 eV as calculated from the onset of absorption spectra in the solid film . 2.3 . Electrochemical Properties . The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) curve of the PBDT - TDPP - S film coated on a platinum electrode is shown in Figure S3 ( see Supporting Information ) , and the electrochemical data are also summarized in Table 2 . An onset oxidation potential of 0.94 V and an onset reduction potential of -0.88 V ( vs SCE ) are observed . Based on an empirical formula , the corresponding HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels ( E HOMO and E LUMO ) of PBDT - TDPP - S were calculated to be -5.34 and -3.52 eV , respectively . This resulting E HOMO level is lower than those of the reported mainchain D - A copolymers of PDPP - BDT ( -5.16 eV ) and PBDTPP - OR ( -5.29 eV ) . 8 The relatively low E HOMO for PBDT - TDPP - S is beneficial to achieve high V OC in PSCs , given the strong correlation between the V OC and the difference between the E HOMO of donor and the E LUMO of acceptor in PSCs . 8 2.4 . Photovoltaic Properties . The photovoltaic properties of the PBDT - TDPP - S were studied in PSCs using PC61BM or PC71BM as an acceptor . The device configuration was ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 30 nm ) / polymer : acceptor ( 80 nm ) / LiF(0.7 nm ) / Al(100 nm ) . The effective device area was 7 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 , as defined by a shadow mask .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name    |\n|------------------|\n| PBDT-TDPP-S      |\n| DCM solution     |\n| polymeric backbone |\n| ICT interaction |\n| donor unit |\n| main chain |\n| acceptor unit |\n| side chain |\n| solid film |\n| PBDTDPP-OR |\n| main-chain copolymer |\n| side-chain copolymer |\n| PDPP-BDT |\n| PBDTPP-OR |\n| PC61BM |\n| PC71BM |\n| ITO |\n| PEDOT:PSS |\n| LiF |\n| Al |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name                |\n|------------------------------|\n| PBDT-TDPP-S                  |\n| DCM solution                 |\n| polymeric backbone           |\n| ICT interaction              |\n| donor unit                   |\n| main chain                   |\n| acceptor unit                |\n| solid film                   |\n| absorption peak              |\n| shoulder                     |\n| high-energy peak             |\n| aggregated configuration     |\n| main-chain copolymer         |\n| side-chain copolymer         |\n| blue-shifted maximum absorption peak |\n| optical band gap (Eg opt)    |\n| onset oxidation potential    |\n| onset reduction potential    |\n| empirical formula            |\n| HOMO and LUMO energy levels  |\n| PSCs (perovskite solar cells)|\n| PC61BM                       |\n| PC71BM                       |\n| ITO                          |\n| PEDOT:PSS                    |\n| LiF                          |\n| Al                           |\n| effective device area        |\n| shadow mask                  |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value          |\n|-------------------------|\n| ∼ 420 nm                |\n| ∼ 590 nm                |\n| 602 nm                  |\n| 655 nm                  |\n| 602 nm                  |\n| 655 nm                  |\n| 100 nm blue-shifted     |\n| 1.73 eV                 |\n| 0.94 V                  |\n| -0.88 V (vs SCE)        |\n| -5.34 eV                |\n| -3.52 eV                |\n| 7 × 10^-2 cm^2          |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
