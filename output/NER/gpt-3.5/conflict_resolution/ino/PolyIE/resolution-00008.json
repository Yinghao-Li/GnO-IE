  {"role": "user", "content": "According to the following paragraph, please identify and resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\nParagraph: Based on the definition , J ph equals to the difference between the current density of devices under 100 mW cm^-2 ( J L ) and that in the dark ( J D ) . V eff = V 0 - V , where V 0 is the voltage at which J L = J D and V is the applied voltage . When the reverse voltage is greater than 2 V , recombination will be suppressed because of a high internal electric field and thus the current density becomes saturated ( J sat ) . Consequently , P(E , T ) = J ph / J sat could be used to describe the charge dissociation probability . The charge dissociation probability of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based cells was estimated to be 0.86 , 0.94 , 0.98 , and 0.92 , respectively . The highest exciton dissociation of the PffBB-14 - based device is anticipated to give rise to the best photovoltaic performance among these series of polymers . Figure 7 demonstrates the dependence of V oc and J sc against light intensity , which could be used to describe the recombination process in BHJ films . The V oc is directly proportional to the incident light intensity in the semilogarithmic plot with a slope of kT / q , which describes bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film , where k represents the Boltzmann constant , T is the Kelvin temperature , and q is the elementary charge . Trap - assisted recombination exists if the slope is larger than kT / q. 42 Among devices fabricated , the PffBB-14 - based cell exhibited the smallest slope of 1.10 kT / q , suggesting the least trap - assisted recombination . Bimolecular recombination was also investigated by measuring the dependence of J sc against light intensity , in which the exponential factor α in the power law of J sc ∝ P light α is used Article to indicate bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film . The closer the estimated α to 1.0 , the weaker the bimolecular recombination occurs in the device . 43 Obviously , with α = 0.98 , the PffBB-14 - based device would exhibit the least occurrence of bimolecular recombination in the active layer . In contrast , the PffBB-10 - based device showed an α value of 0.86 , indicating that the bimolecular recombination loss was severe in its BHJ film . These results consistently indicate that the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend with superior balanced charge carrier transport exhibits the least recombination loss among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs , thus affording the highest J sc and FF . Morphology of the Active Layer . AFM images of PffBBn : PC71BM blended thin films were obtained to investigate their microphase separation behavior and the corresponding AFM height and phase images recorded in the tapping mode are shown in Figure 8 . Good miscibility could be observed in all of the PffBB - n : PC71BM blended thin films , which gives rise to desirable phase separation .\n\nNER Response 1: | Material Name |\n|--------------|\n| PffBB-10     |\n| PffBB-12     |\n| PffBB-14     |\n| PffBB-16     |\n\nNER Response 2: | Property Name       |\n|---------------------|\n| J ph                |\n| J L                 |\n| J D                 |\n| V eff               |\n| V 0                 |\n| J sat               |\n| P(E, T)             |\n| BHJ films           |\n| V oc                |\n| J sc                |\n| P light             |\n| FF                  |\n| Active Layer        |\n| AFM                 |\n\nNER Response 3: | Property Value                |\n|-------------------------------|\n| J_ph                          |\n| J_L                           |\n| J_D                           |\n| V_eff                         |\n| V_0                           |\n| J_sat                         |\n| P(E, T)                       |\n| PffBB-10                      |\n| PffBB-12                      |\n| PffBB-14                      |\n| PffBB-16                      |\n| PffBB-14-based device         |\n| V_oc                          |\n| J_sc                          |\n| PffBB-10-based device         |\n| PffBB-14:PC71BM blend         |\n| PffBBn:PC71BM-based PSCs      |\n| FF                            |\n\nLet's think step by step."},
