Therefore, both \"Indiana\" and \"Golden State\" should be identified as organizations.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Indiana      |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Indiana      |\n| Golden State |\n\nNER Response 3: |              |\n|--------------|\n|              |\n\nThe conflicts have been resolved, and the named entities have been correctly identified as organizations."},
