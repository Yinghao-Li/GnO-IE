Therefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering NER Response 2 as the correct identification for \"Sheffield Wednesday\" as an organization. \n\nStep 3: Update the resolved conflicts.\n\nResolved NER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|          |\n\nResolved NER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Sheffield Wednesday |\n\nResolved NER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
