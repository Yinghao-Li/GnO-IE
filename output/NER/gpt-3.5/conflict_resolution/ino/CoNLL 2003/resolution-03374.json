Therefore, it should be classified as an organization, as mentioned in NER Response 2.\n- Conflict 2: Since NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity, we can assume that \"Buffalo\" is referring to the Buffalo Sabres, another professional ice hockey team. Therefore, it should also be classified as an organization, as mentioned in NER Response 2.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Anaheim  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Buffalo      |\n| Anaheim      |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Buffalo      |"},
