It should not be identified as a person entity.\n\nTo resolve this conflict, the NER system should correctly identify the named entity as \"wing\" instead of \"30-year-old\".\n\nIn summary, the conflict in the NER results is the misclassification of \"30-year-old\" as a person entity instead of correctly identifying it as an age description."},
