However, there is a conflict in the location of the headquarters. NER Response 1 identifies Santa Fe as headquartered in Albuquerque, N.M., while NER Response 2 does not provide any information about the headquarters.\n\nTo resolve this conflict, we can consider the context of the paragraph. Since the paragraph mentions that Santa Fe is headquartered in Albuquerque, N.M., we can conclude that NER Response 1 is correct in identifying the location of the headquarters.\n\nTherefore, the resolved NER results are as follows:\n\nNER Response 1:\n| Location         |\n|------------------|\n| Santa Fe         |\n| Albuquerque, N.M.|\n\nNER Response 2:\n| Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Santa Fe     |\n\nNER Response 3 does not provide any relevant information and can be disregarded."},
