The capitalization difference might be causing this conflict.\n\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not provide any entity type for \"Y\". It is unclear whether \"Y\" should be considered a named entity or not.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1: The capitalization difference between \"Green Bay\" and \"GREEN BAY\" suggests that they might refer to the same entity. To resolve this conflict, we can consider \"Green Bay\" and \"GREEN BAY\" as referring to the same entity and merge the two responses into one.\n\n- Conflict 2: Since NER Response 3 does not provide any entity type for \"Y\", we can assume that \"Y\" is not a named entity and remove it from the resolved NER results.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n| Entity Type |\n|-------------|\n| Green Bay   |"},
