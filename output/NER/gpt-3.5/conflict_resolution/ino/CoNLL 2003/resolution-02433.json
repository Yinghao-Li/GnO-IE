NER Response 3 does not provide any identification for this named entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need more context or information about the named entity \"JCPENNEY CLASSIC\" or \"JCPenney Classic\". Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the correct identification.\n\nHowever, based on the given paragraph, it is more likely that \"JCPENNEY CLASSIC\" or \"JCPenney Classic\" refers to a golf tournament or event rather than a location. Therefore, we can conclude that NER Response 2, which identifies it as an Organization, is more accurate.\n\nResolved NER Result: \n| Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| JCPenney Classic   |"},
