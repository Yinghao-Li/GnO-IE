Response 1 identifies it as a location, while Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n- There is no conflict with NER Response 3 as it does not identify any named entity.\n\nStep 3: Resolve Conflicts\n- Based on the context of the paragraph, it is more likely that \"Polish market\" refers to an organization rather than a location. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by accepting NER Response 2 as the correct identification.\n\nResolved Named Entity Recognition (NER) Results:\n- \"Polish market\" is identified as an organization.\n- \"Local oil industry\" is correctly identified as an organization."},
