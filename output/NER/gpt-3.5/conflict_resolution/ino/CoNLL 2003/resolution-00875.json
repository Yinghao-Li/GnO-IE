Since the paragraph mentions the \"Results of semifinals\" in relation to the tournament, it is more likely that \"Mahindra International squash tournament\" refers to an organization rather than a location. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by accepting NER Response 2, which identifies it as an organization. \n\nAs for NER Response 3, it does not provide any relevant information and can be disregarded in this case."},
