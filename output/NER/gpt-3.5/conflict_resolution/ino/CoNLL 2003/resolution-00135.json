NER Response 1 identifies \"Pakistan\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. NER Response 3 does not identify any entity type for \"Pakistan\".\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for the named entity \"Pakistan\" based on the context provided in the paragraph.\n\nIn the given paragraph, \"Pakistan\" is mentioned in the context of winning a match. Since countries can participate in sports events and win matches, it is more appropriate to consider \"Pakistan\" as an organization (specifically, a sports team representing the country) rather than a location.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering NER Response 2 as the correct identification for the named entity \"Pakistan\" in this context.\n\nResolved NER Result: \nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Pakistan     |"},
