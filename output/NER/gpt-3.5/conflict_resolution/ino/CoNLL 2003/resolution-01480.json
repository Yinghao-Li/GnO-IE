Therefore, NER Response 1 is correct in labeling it as a Location.\n- Conflict 2: Without further context, it is difficult to determine whether \"Alatas\" refers to an organization or a person. However, if we consider that \"Alatas\" is a common surname in some cultures, it is more likely that it refers to a person. Therefore, NER Response 3 is more accurate in labeling it as a Person.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location    |\n|-------------|\n| East Timor  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Alatas       |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| Alatas |"},
