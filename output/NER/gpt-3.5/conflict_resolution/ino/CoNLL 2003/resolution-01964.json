NER Response 1 identifies \"Cairo\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct identification of \"Cairo\" based on the context of the paragraph. In this case, since the paragraph mentions that Arafat and Netanyahu will meet in Cairo, it is more likely that \"Cairo\" refers to a location rather than an organization. Therefore, NER Response 1, which identifies \"Cairo\" as a location, is the correct identification.\n\nStep 3: Verify the remaining named entities.\n\nThe named entities \"Arafat\" and \"Netanyahu\" are correctly identified as persons in NER Response 3.\n\nFinal resolved NER results:\n\n| Location |\n|----------|\n|  Cairo   |\n\n| Person       |\n|--------------|\n| Arafat       |\n| Netanyahu    |"},
