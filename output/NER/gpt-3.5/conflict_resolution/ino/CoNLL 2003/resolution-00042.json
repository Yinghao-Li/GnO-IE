Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Syria\" as a location.\n\n- Conflict 2: Since there is no mention of any organization in the paragraph, we can resolve this conflict by rejecting NER Response 2 and considering \"Japan\" and \"Syria\" as locations instead of organizations.\n\n- Conflict 3: As mentioned in the paragraph, \"Japan\" is involved in the action, so we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 2 and considering \"Japan\" as an organization.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n- \"Syria\" is a Location.\n- \"Japan\" is an Organization."},
