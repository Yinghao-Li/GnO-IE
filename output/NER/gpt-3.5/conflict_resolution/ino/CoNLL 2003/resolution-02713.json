Therefore, NER Response 1 is incorrect. NER Response 2 correctly identifies \"Indonesia\" as an organization.\n- \"Denmark\" is a country, not an organization. Therefore, NER Response 2 is incorrect. NER Response 1 does not mention \"Denmark\" at all, so it does not provide any conflicting information.\n- \"Susi Susanti\" and \"Camilla Martin\" are both correctly identified as persons in NER Response 3.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Indonesia    |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Indonesia    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person         |\n|----------------|\n| Susi Susanti   |\n| Camilla Martin |\n\nBy resolving the conflicts, we have identified the correct named entities and their respective types."},
