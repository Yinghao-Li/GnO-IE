However, there is a conflict in the identification of \"The head of the International Labour Organisation (ILO)\" as a person entity. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that the head of the ILO had been barred from speaking at the WTO meeting. Therefore, \"The head of the International Labour Organisation (ILO)\" should be identified as an organization entity rather than a person entity.\n\nResolved conflicts:\n\n- \"The head of the International Labour Organisation (ILO)\" should be identified as an organization entity instead of a person entity."},
