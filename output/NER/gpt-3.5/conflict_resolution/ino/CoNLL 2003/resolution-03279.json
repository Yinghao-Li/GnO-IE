It could potentially be both. Therefore, we cannot definitively resolve this conflict without additional information.\n- Conflict 2: Since NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity, we can consider it as not providing any conflicting information. Therefore, this conflict does not need to be resolved.\n\nIn summary, the conflicts in the NER results are related to the identification of \"UTAH\" as either a Location or an Organization. Without more context, it is not possible to definitively resolve this conflict."},
