It should be \"Organization\" instead.\n\nStep 2: Resolve Conflicts\n- There is no conflict between NER Response 1 and NER Response 2 as they identify different named entities.\n- The conflict lies between NER Response 2 and NER Response 3, where the entity \"Police\" is identified as both an \"Organization\" and a \"Person\". Based on the context of the paragraph, \"Police\" refers to the law enforcement agency, which is an organization. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by considering NER Response 2 as the correct identification.\n\nResolved Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n- Location: Kitchen\n- Organization: Police"},
