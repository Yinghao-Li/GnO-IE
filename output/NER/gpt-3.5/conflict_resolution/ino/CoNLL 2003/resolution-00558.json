Conflict 1: The first NER response identifies \"Houston\" as a location, while the second NER response identifies \"HOUSTON\" as an organization. These two entities refer to the same place but are written in different cases. To resolve this conflict, we can consider \"Houston\" as the correct entity since it is the standard way of writing the city name.\n\n2. Conflict 2: The third NER response does not identify any named entity for the given text \"1996 - 12 - 05\". It is possible that this text represents a date or a specific event, but without further context, it is difficult to determine the correct entity type. To resolve this conflict, we can consider this text as a date entity.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Houston  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n|   Houston    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Date |\n|--------|\n| 1996 - 12 - 05 |"},
