If the paragraph is referring to the Italian football league, then it should be classified as an Organization.\n\nTo resolve Conflict 2, we can assume that \"Italian Serie A\" should also be classified as an Organization since it is referring to a sports league.\n\nTherefore, the resolved NER results would be:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Italian Serie A    |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Italian Serie A    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Italian Serie A    |"},
