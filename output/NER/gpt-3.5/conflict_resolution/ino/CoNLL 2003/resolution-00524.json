However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the intended meaning. Therefore, it is advisable to consider \"CHICAGO\" as a named entity without specifying its type.\n\n- Conflict 2 resolution: Since there is no mention of any person entity in the paragraph, NER Response 3 is correct in not identifying any person. Therefore, there is no conflict to resolve in this case.\n\nOverall, the conflicts in the NER results can be resolved by considering \"CHICAGO\" as a named entity without specifying its type and accepting NER Response 3 as the correct identification of person entities."},
