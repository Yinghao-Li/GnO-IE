They both correctly identify the named entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nHowever, there is a conflict between NER Response 3 and the other responses. NER Response 3 includes \"he\" as a person entity, while the other responses do not.

Therefore, we can consider \"he\" as a person entity.\n\nResolved NER Response 3: \n\n| Person |\n|--------|\n|  he    |\n|  the government in Kinshasa |\n|  the Zairean rebels |\n\nStep 3: Provide the resolved NER results.\n\nThe resolved NER results are as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: \n\n| Location        |\n|-----------------|\n| Kinshasa        |\n| Eastern Zaire   |\n\nNER Response 2: \n\n| Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Government in Kinshasa |\n| Zairean rebels |\n\nResolved NER Response 3: \n\n| Person |\n|--------|\n|  he    |\n|  the government in Kinshasa |\n|  the Zairean rebels |"},
