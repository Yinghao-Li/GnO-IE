NER Response 1 identifies \"KCBT\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"KCBT\" based on the context provided in the paragraph. \n\nIn this case, \"KCBT\" refers to a commodity exchange, specifically the Kansas City Board of Trade. Therefore, the correct entity type for \"KCBT\" is an organization. \n\nSo, the resolved NER result for \"KCBT\" would be:\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| KCBT         |\n\nStep 3: Check if there are any remaining conflicts.\n\nIn this case, there are no remaining conflicts as there is only one entity identified and resolved.\n\nTherefore, the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results have been identified and resolved."},
