Conflict 1: NER Response 1 identifies \"Paramygina 79\" as a Location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an Organization. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\n2. Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity for \"Paramygina 79\". This conflict needs to be resolved as well.\n\nNow, let's resolve these conflicts:\n\n1. Conflict 1: Since \"Paramygina 79\" is a specific address or location, it is more likely to be a Location rather than an Organization. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Paramygina 79\" as a Location.\n\n2. Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not provide any information about \"Paramygina 79\". However, based on the context, it is reasonable to assume that \"Paramygina 79\" refers to a specific place or address. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Paramygina 79\" as a Location.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Paramygina 79 |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Paramygina 79 |\n\nNER Response 3: | Location |\n|--------|\n| Paramygina 79 |"},
