These two entities should be resolved to the same entity type.\n\nConflict 2: The NER Response 3 identifies \"Officials\" as a Person, but there is no conflict with any other entity type.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nConflict 1 Resolution: Based on the context of the paragraph, it is more appropriate to consider \"World Cup Weekend\" as an Event rather than a Location or an Organization. Therefore, both NER Response 1 and NER Response 2 should be resolved to the entity type Event.\n\nConflict 2 Resolution: There is no conflict with the entity type Person, so NER Response 3 remains unchanged.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Event |\n|--------|\n| World Cup Weekend |\n\nNER Response 2: | Event |\n|--------|\n| World Cup       |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| Officials |"},
