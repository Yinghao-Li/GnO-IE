NER Response 1 identifies \"Steers\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n- The second conflict is between NER Response 2 and NER Response 3. NER Response 2 identifies \"Steers\" as an organization, while NER Response 3 does not identify it as any named entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- To resolve the first conflict, we need more context or knowledge about what \"Steers\" refers to in the given paragraph. If \"Steers\" is a well-known restaurant chain, it is more likely to be an organization rather than a location. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the correct entity type.\n- To resolve the second conflict, we can consider NER Response 2 as the more reliable result since it identifies \"Steers\" as an organization. NER Response 3 not identifying it as any named entity could be a false negative.\n\nOverall, the conflicts in the NER results cannot be fully resolved without additional context or knowledge."},
