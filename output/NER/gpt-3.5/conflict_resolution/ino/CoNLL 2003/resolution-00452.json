NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity for \"CHARLOTTE\".\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need more context or information about the word \"CHARLOTTE\". Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the correct named entity type for \"CHARLOTTE\". \n\nHowever, based on common knowledge, \"CHARLOTTE\" can refer to both a location (e.g., Charlotte, North Carolina) and an organization (e.g., Charlotte Hornets basketball team). Therefore, it is possible that both NER Response 1 and NER Response 2 are correct, depending on the specific context.\n\nIf more context or information is provided, it would be easier to determine the correct named entity type for \"CHARLOTTE\"."},
