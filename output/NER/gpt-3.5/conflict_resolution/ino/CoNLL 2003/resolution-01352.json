Therefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering \"Kremlin\" as a location in both NER Response 1 and NER Response 2.\n\nResolved NER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Russia   |\n| Kremlin  |\n\nResolved NER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Kremlin      |\n\nNER Response 3 remains unchanged: | Person   |\n|----------|\n| Yeltsin  |\n\nNow the conflicts in the NER results have been resolved."},
