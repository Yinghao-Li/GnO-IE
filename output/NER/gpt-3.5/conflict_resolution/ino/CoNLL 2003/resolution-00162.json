NER Response 1 identifies \"CSKA Moscow\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. Additionally, NER Response 3 does not provide any information about \"CSKA Moscow\".\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine whether \"CSKA Moscow\" refers to a location or an organization. \n\nBased on common knowledge, \"CSKA Moscow\" is a sports club based in Moscow, Russia. Therefore, it can be considered both an organization and a location. However, in this context, it is more likely to be referring to the organization rather than the location.\n\nSo, we can resolve the conflicts by considering \"CSKA Moscow\" as an organization.\n\nResolved NER Results: \nNER Response 1: | Organization    |\n|-----------------|\n| CSKA Moscow     |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization    |\n|-----------------|\n| CSKA Moscow     |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization    |\n|-----------------|\n| CSKA Moscow     |"},
