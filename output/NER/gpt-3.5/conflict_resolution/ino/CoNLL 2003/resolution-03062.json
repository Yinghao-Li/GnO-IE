This conflict arises because \"Greenock Morton\" is a football club based in Greenock, Scotland. Therefore, it can be considered both a location and an organization.\n\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity, but there is a missing named entity in the paragraph. The missing named entity is \"St Johnstone,\" which should be identified as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\n- Conflict 1 resolution: Merge the results of NER Response 1 and NER Response 2 to identify \"Greenock Morton\" as an organization located in Greenock, Scotland.\n\n- Conflict 2 resolution: Add \"St Johnstone\" as an organization in the NER results.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Greenock |\n| Scotland |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Greenock Morton    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------|\n| St Johnstone |"},
