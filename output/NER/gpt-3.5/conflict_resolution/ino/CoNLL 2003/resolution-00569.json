This conflict arises because \"Waalwijk\" is a location, but it is also part of the name of the organization \"RKC Waalwijk\".\n\nConflict 2: The third NER response does not identify any named entities, but there is a person mentioned in the paragraph. This conflict arises because the person's name is not recognized as a named entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nConflict 1 resolution: Merge the information from the first and second NER responses. The correct identification should be:\n\n| Organization       | Location |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| RKC Waalwijk       | Tilburg  |\n\nConflict 2 resolution: Add the missing named entity. The correct identification should be:\n\n| Organization       | Location | Person |\n|--------------------|----------|--------|\n| RKC Waalwijk       | Tilburg  |        |\n\nThe resolved conflicts are:\n\nConflict 1: \"Waalwijk\" is part of the name of the organization \"RKC Waalwijk\".\nConflict 2: The person's name is missing from the NER results."},
