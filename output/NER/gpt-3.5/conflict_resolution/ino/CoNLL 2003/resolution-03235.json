Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"UAE\" as a Location.\n- Conflict 2: Since \"Hassan Ahmed\" and \"Adnan Al Talyani\" are not mentioned in the paragraph, we can assume that the NER Response 3 made an incorrect identification. We should remove these entities from the resolved results.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n- | Location |\n  |----------|\n  |   UAE    |"},
