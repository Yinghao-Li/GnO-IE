Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"HOBART\" as a Location.\n- Conflict 2: Since NER Response 1 and NER Response 2 both identify \"HOBART\" as a named entity, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"HOBART\" as a named entity.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| HOBART   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| HOBART       |\n\nNER Response 3: | Location |\n|--------|\n|  None  |"},
