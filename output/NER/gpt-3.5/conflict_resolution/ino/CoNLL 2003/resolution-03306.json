Conflict 1: The entity \"National\" is identified as a location in NER Response 1, but it is identified as part of the organization \"National Basketball\" in NER Response 2. \n\nResolution: The conflict can be resolved by considering NER Response 2 as it provides a more specific identification of the entity \"National Basketball\" as an organization. Therefore, \"National\" should be considered as part of the organization rather than a separate location.\n\n2. Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not provide any identification for a named entity.\n\nResolution: Since NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant information, it can be ignored in this case.\n\nResolved Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\n- Organization: National Basketball"},
