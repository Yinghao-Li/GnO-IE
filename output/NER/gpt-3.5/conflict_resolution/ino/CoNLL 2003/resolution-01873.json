This conflict arises because NER Response 1 does not recognize the full entity \"Milan newsroom\" as an Organization.\n\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity, while both NER Response 1 and NER Response 2 identify \"Milan\" as a named entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1 can be resolved by considering NER Response 2 as the correct identification. Therefore, \"Milan newsroom\" should be recognized as an Organization.\n\n- Conflict 2 can be resolved by considering NER Response 1 as the correct identification. Therefore, \"Milan\" should be recognized as a Location.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Milan    |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Milan newsroom |\n\nNER Response 3: |        |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
