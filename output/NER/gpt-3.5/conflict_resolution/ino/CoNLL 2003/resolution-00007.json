Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Asian Cup\" as a Location, which aligns with NER Response 1.\n- Conflict 2: The paragraph does not provide enough information to determine whether \"former Soviet republic\" refers to a specific Location or Organization. Therefore, we cannot resolve this conflict without additional context.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Asian Cup finals |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Asian Cup    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
