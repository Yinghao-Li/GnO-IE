NER Response 1 identifies it as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Mauritian authorities\" based on the context provided in the paragraph. In this case, \"Mauritian authorities\" refers to a group or organization responsible for making decisions or taking actions in Mauritius. Therefore, NER Response 2, which identifies it as an organization, is the correct resolution.\n\nStep 3: Final resolved NER results.\n\nThe resolved NER results are as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: \n| Location       |\n|----------------|\n| Indian Ocean   |\n| Mauritius      |\n\nNER Response 2: \n| Organization         |\n|----------------------|\n| Mauritian authorities |\n\nNER Response 3: \n| Person            |\n|-------------------|\n| Mauritian authorities |"},
