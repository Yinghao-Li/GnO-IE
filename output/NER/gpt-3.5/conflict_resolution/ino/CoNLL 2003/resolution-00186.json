This conflict arises because NER Response 3 does not recognize \"Kinder Bologna\" as a named entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\n- Conflict 1 resolution: Combine the results from NER Response 1 and NER Response 2 to identify \"Kinder Bologna\" as an organization located in \"Bologna\".\n\n- Conflict 2 resolution: Assign the entity type \"Organization\" to \"Kinder Bologna\" in NER Response 3 to match the resolved entity from Conflict 1.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Bologna  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Kinder Bologna |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Kinder Bologna |"},
