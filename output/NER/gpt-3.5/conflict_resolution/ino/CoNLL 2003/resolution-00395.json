Conflict between NER Response 1 and NER Response 3:\n   - NER Response 1 identifies \"Anaheim\" and \"Buffalo\" as \"Location\" entities.\n   - NER Response 3 does not identify any \"Person\" entities.\n   - To resolve this conflict, it is necessary to determine whether there are any \"Person\" entities mentioned in the paragraph that were missed by NER Response 3.\n\nOverall, the conflicts in the NER results arise from the ambiguity of the entities mentioned in the paragraph and the need for additional context or information to accurately classify them."},
