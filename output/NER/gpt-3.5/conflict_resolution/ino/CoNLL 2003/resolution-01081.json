Therefore, they should be identified as locations, not organizations.\n\nSo, the correct identification of the named entities would be:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Pakistan |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Pakistan |\n| New Zealand |\n\nNER Response 3: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Pakistan |\n| New Zealand |\n\nBy resolving the conflicts, we have identified the named entities and their correct types."},
