Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering \"Syria\" as a location entity.\n\n- Conflict 2 resolution: The paragraph does not provide enough information to identify any specific person involved in the defensive blunder. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering that there is no person entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|  Syria   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Syria        |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
