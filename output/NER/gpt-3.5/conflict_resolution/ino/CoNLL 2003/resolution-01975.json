However, there is a conflict in the NER results regarding the entity \"Israel.\" In NER Response 1, \"Israel\" is identified as a location, while in NER Response 2, it is identified as an organization.\n\nTo resolve this conflict, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Israel\" based on the context.
