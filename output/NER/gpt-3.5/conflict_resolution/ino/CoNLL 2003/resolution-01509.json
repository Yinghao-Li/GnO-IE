NER Response 1 identifies \"Junctions\" as a valid \"Location\" entity, while NER Response 2 does not mention it.\n\nNER Response 2 and NER Response 3 have conflicting results for the entity \"Armed Riot Police\". NER Response 2 identifies \"Armed Riot Police\" as a valid \"Organization\" entity, while NER Response 3 identifies it as a valid \"Person\" entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity types for the identified entities.\n\n- \"Junctions\" is more likely to be a valid \"Location\" entity, as it refers to a specific place near the institute.\n\n- \"Armed Riot Police\" is more likely to be a valid \"Organization\" entity, as it refers to a group of police officers.\n\nTherefore, the resolved conflicts are:\n\nNER Response 1: \n| Location |\n|----------|\n| Junctions |\n\nNER Response 2: \n| Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Armed Riot Police |\n| Fire Department |\n\nNER Response 3: \n| Organization        |\n|-------------------|\n| Armed riot police |"},
