Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by removing \"Reading\" from the named entities.\n- Conflict 2: Based on the context, \"Port Vale\" is more likely to be a football club (organization) rather than a location. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Port Vale\" as an organization.\n- Conflict 3: Since NER Response 1 and 2 identify \"Reading\" and \"Port Vale\" as named entities, we can assume that there are named entities present in the paragraph. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Reading\" and \"Port Vale\" as named entities.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Port Vale |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Port Vale    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Location |\n|--------|\n| Reading |"},
