The conflicts are as follows:\n\n1. In NER Response 1, \"Huddersfield\" is identified as a location.\n2. In NER Response 2, \"Huddersfield\" is identified as an organization, and \"Norwich\" is also identified as an organization.\n3. NER Response 3 does not identify any named entities.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct identification of the named entities based on the given paragraph.\n\nBased on the paragraph \"Huddersfield 2 Norwich 0,\" we can infer that \"Huddersfield\" and \"Norwich\" are both football teams. Therefore, the correct identification of the named entities should be:\n\n1. \"Huddersfield\" - Organization\n2. \"Norwich\" - Organization\n\nSo, the conflicts in the NER results can be resolved as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Huddersfield |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Huddersfield  |\n| Norwich      |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Huddersfield  |\n| Norwich      |"},
