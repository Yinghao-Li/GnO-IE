Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Central region\" as a Location.\n\nConflict 2: Without further information, it is not possible to determine whether \"Bre-X\" refers to a person or an organization. However, since NER Response 2 labeled it as an Organization, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Bre-X\" as an Organization.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location       |\n|----------------|\n| Central region |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Bre-X        |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Bre-X        |"},
