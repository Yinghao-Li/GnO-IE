It identifies \"McDonald's staff\" as a person entity, which is incorrect. \"McDonald's staff\" should be identified as an organization entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflict in NER Response 3, we need to correct the entity type for \"McDonald's staff\" from \"Person\" to \"Organization\".\n\nUpdated NER Response 3: \n\n| Person       |\n|--------------|\n| Lee Bowyer   |\n\n| Organization |\n|--------------|\n| McDonald's   |\n\nNow, the conflicts in the NER results have been resolved."},
