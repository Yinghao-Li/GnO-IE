Conflict 1: The entity \"DES MOINES\" is identified as a Location in NER Response 1, but as an Organization in NER Response 2. \n\nResolution: To resolve this conflict, we need more context or information about \"DES MOINES\" to determine whether it refers to a location or an organization. \n\n2. Conflict 2: NER Response 2 identifies \"DES MOINES 1996\" as an Organization, but there is no clear indication or context provided to determine if it is indeed an organization. \n\nResolution: Without further context, it is difficult to determine the correct entity type for \"DES MOINES 1996\". It could potentially be a date or some other type of entity. \n\n3. Conflict 3: NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity for the given text \"DES MOINES 1996 - 12 - 06\". \n\nResolution: It is possible that NER Response 3 failed to recognize any named entity in the given text.
