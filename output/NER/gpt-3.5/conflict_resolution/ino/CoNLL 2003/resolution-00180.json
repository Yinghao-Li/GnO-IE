Therefore, NER Response 2 should be corrected to identify \"Split\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: Since there is no mention of any person in the paragraph, NER Response 3 is correct in not identifying any person.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Split (Croatia) |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Split        |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| None   |"},
