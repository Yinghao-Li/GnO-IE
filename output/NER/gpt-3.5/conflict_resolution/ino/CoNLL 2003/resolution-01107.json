Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and discarding NER Response 2.\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not provide any entity type for \"Thunder Bay\", so we cannot resolve this conflict based on the given information. We can either consider it as an error or seek additional context to determine the correct entity type.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location     |\n|--------------|\n| Thunder Bay  |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
