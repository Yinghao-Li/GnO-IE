NER Response 1 identifies \"Fulham\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n- The second conflict is between NER Response 2 and NER Response 3. NER Response 2 identifies \"Fulham\" as an organization, while NER Response 3 does not identify it as any named entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Based on the given paragraph, \"Fulham\" is most likely referring to a football club, which is an organization. Therefore, NER Response 2 is correct in identifying \"Fulham\" as an organization.\n- Since NER Response 3 does not identify \"Fulham\" as any named entity, it is incorrect. \"Fulham\" should be identified as an organization, as per NER Response 2.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| None     |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n|   Fulham     |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------|\n| Fulham   |"},
