Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Cagliari\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: Since there is no mention of \"Reggiana\" in NER Response 1 or NER Response 3, we can resolve this conflict by considering it as a false positive in NER Response 2.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location  |\n|-----------|\n| Cagliari  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n|              |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |\n\nThe conflicts have been resolved, and the final NER results have been updated accordingly."},
