NER Response 1 identifies \"Austria\" as a location, NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization, and NER Response 3 does not provide any specific named entity type.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to consider the context of the paragraph. Since the paragraph mentions \"1,973 points\" after \"Austria\", it is likely that \"Austria\" refers to a sports team or a country participating in a competition rather than a person or an organization.\n\nBased on this context, we can conclude that \"Austria\" is most likely a country (location) participating in a competition. Therefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering NER Response 1 as the correct identification.\n\nResolved NER Result: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Austria  |"},
