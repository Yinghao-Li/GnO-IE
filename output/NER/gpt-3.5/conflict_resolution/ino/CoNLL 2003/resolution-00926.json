NER Response 1 identifies \"Parliament\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve conflicts\n\n- Based on the context of the paragraph, \"Parliament\" is more likely to be an organization rather than a location. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering \"Parliament\" as an organization.\n\nUpdated NER Response:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Parliament         |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Parliament         |\n| Coalition          |\n| Social Democrats   |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| Klaus  |"},
