NER Response 1 identifies \"Norilsk\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. NER Response 3 does not identify any entity for \"Norilsk\".\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Norilsk\" based on the context provided in the paragraph. \n\nIn the given paragraph, \"Norilsk\" is mentioned in relation to its situation, which suggests that it is referring to a place or location rather than an organization or a person. Therefore, we can conclude that NER Response 1, which identifies \"Norilsk\" as a location, is the correct identification.\n\nResolved NER Result: \nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Norilsk  |"},
