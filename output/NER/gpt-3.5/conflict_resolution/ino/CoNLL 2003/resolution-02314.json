NER Response 2 identifies \"Barrick\" as an organization, while NER Response 3 identifies it as a person. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we need to determine whether \"Barrick\" refers to an organization or a person in the given context. Since the paragraph mentions \"Barrick said to continue Busang talks,\" it suggests that \"Barrick\" is likely referring to an organization rather than a person. Therefore, we should resolve the conflict by considering \"Barrick\" as an organization.\n\nUpdated NER Response: \nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Barrick       |\n\nNow, the conflict in the NER results has been resolved."},
