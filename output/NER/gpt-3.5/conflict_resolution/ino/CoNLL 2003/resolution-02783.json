This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nConflict 2: The first NER response identifies \"Glasgow\" as a location, but there is no mention of \"Glasgow\" in the paragraph. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nConflict 1 resolution: Based on the paragraph, \"Dundee United\" is indeed an organization, so the second NER response is correct. The first NER response incorrectly identifies \"Dundee\" as a location. \n\nConflict 2 resolution: The first NER response incorrectly identifies \"Glasgow\" as a location. Since there is no mention of \"Glasgow\" in the paragraph, this NER response is incorrect.\n\nStep 3: Provide the resolved NER results.\n\nResolved NER Response 1: | Location        |\n|-----------------|\n| Dundee United   |\n\nResolved NER Response 2: | Person         |\n|----------------|\n| Paolo Di Canio |\n\nThe resolved NER results are \"Dundee United\" as an organization and \"Paolo Di Canio\" as a person."},
