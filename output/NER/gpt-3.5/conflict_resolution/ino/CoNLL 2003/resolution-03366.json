Therefore, NER Response 1 correctly identifies them as Locations.\n\nHowever, in NER Response 2, \"Colorado\" is incorrectly identified as an Organization. It should be identified as a Location, similar to NER Response 1.\n\nNER Response 3 does not provide any named entity identification, so it does not conflict with the other responses.\n\nTherefore, the conflicts in the NER results are resolved by considering NER Response 1 for \"COLORADO\" and \"LOS ANGELES\" as Locations, and NER Response 2 for \"Colorado\" as a Location."},
