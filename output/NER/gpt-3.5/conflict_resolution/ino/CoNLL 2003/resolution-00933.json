Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting the first NER response and considering \"Switzerland\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: The third NER response does not provide any relevant information and does not align with the context of the paragraph. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by disregarding the third NER response.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location   |\n|------------|\n| Switzerland|\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n|                |"},
