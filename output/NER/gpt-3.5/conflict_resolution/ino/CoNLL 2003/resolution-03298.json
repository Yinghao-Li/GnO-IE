Therefore, NER Response 1 is correct in identifying them as locations.\n\nHowever, NER Response 2 incorrectly identifies \"Detroit\" and \"New Jersey\" as organizations. They should be identified as locations, not organizations.\n\nNER Response 3 does not provide any named entities, so it is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the conflicts in the NER results are resolved as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location    |\n|-------------|\n| DETROIT     |\n| NEW JERSEY  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Detroit      |\n| New Jersey   |\n\nNER Response 3: | Location |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
