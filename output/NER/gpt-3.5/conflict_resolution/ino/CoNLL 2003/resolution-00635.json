Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by accepting NER Response 2.\n- Since NER Response 2 identifies \"Willem II Tilburg\" as an organization and NER Response 1 does not mention it, we can resolve the conflict by accepting NER Response 2.\n- NER Response 3 identifies \"Starbuck 76\" and \"Konterman 45\" as persons, which seems incorrect. There is no context to suggest that these are person names. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by disregarding NER Response 3.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\n- Organization: RKC Waalwijk, Willem II Tilburg\n- Location: Tilburg"},
