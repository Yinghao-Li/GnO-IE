Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"ST LOUIS\" as a Location.\n- Conflict 2: Since there is no mention of \"Phoenix\" in the paragraph, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 2 for \"St. Louis\" as an Organization and disregarding the mention of \"Phoenix.\"\n- Conflict 3: Since NER Response 1 and NER Response 2 both identify named entities, we can resolve this conflict by disregarding NER Response 3, which does not identify any named entities.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n- Location: ST LOUIS\n- Organization: St. Louis"},
