Based on the context of the paragraph, it is more likely that \"Oxford\" refers to a location rather than an organization. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Oxford\" as a location.\n\nStep 3: Final NER results after conflict resolution.\n\n- \"Crystal Palace\" is identified as an organization.\n- \"Oxford\" is identified as a location."},
