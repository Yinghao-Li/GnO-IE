Ireland\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n\nConflict 2: NER Response 2 identifies \"N. Ireland arms find\" as an organization, while NER Response 3 identifies \"Woman\" as a person.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nConflict 1 resolution: Based on common knowledge, \"N. Ireland\" refers to Northern Ireland, which is a region or location. Therefore, NER Response 1 is correct in identifying it as a location.\n\nConflict 2 resolution: \"N. Ireland arms find\" is not a specific organization but rather a description of an event or incident. Therefore, NER Response 2 is incorrect in identifying it as an organization. NER Response 3 correctly identifies \"Woman\" as a person involved in the incident.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------------|\n| Northern Ireland |\n\nNER Response 2: | Incorrect |\n|--------------|\n| N/A          |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| Woman  |"},
