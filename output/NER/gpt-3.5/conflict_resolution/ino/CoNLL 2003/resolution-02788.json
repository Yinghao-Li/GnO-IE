NER Response 1 identifies \"Arsenal\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct identification for the named entity \"Arsenal\" based on the context provided in the paragraph. Since \"Ian Wright\" is mentioned in relation to \"Arsenal\", it is likely that \"Arsenal\" refers to the football club rather than a physical location. Therefore, NER Response 2, which identifies \"Arsenal\" as an organization, is the correct identification.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| -        |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Arsenal      |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person       |\n|--------------|\n| Ian Wright   |"},
