NER Response 2 identifies \"School\" as an organization, while NER Response 3 identifies \"School football player\" as a person.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"School\". Based on the context of the paragraph, it is more likely that \"School\" refers to a location rather than an organization. Therefore, we should resolve the conflict by changing the entity type of \"School\" from organization to location.\n\nUpdated NER Response: \nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| None     |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| School       |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person               |\n|----------------------|\n| School football player |"},
