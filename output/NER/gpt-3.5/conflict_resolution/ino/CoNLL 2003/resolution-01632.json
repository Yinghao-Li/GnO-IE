Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"City of Hartford\" as a Location.\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant identification for \"City of Hartford\". As it is a city, it does not refer to a specific person. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by disregarding NER Response 3.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location       |\n|----------------|\n| City of Hartford |"},
