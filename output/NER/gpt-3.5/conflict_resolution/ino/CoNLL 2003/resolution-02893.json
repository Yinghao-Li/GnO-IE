Response 1 identifies \"Scottish League\" as a location, while Response 2 identifies it as an organization. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine whether \"Scottish League\" should be classified as a location or an organization. \n\nIn this context, \"Scottish League\" refers to a sports league, specifically a soccer league. Therefore, it should be classified as an organization rather than a location. \n\nStep 3: Update the NER results.\n\nBased on the resolution, we can update the NER results as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Scottish League |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Scottish League |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |\n\nNow the conflicts have been resolved, and the NER results are consistent."},
