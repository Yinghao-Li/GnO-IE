NER Response 1 identifies \"Mauritius\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity for \"Mauritius\".\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct named entity type for \"Mauritius\" based on the context provided in the paragraph. In this case, the paragraph mentions \"cyclone alert\", which suggests that \"Mauritius\" is most likely a location rather than an organization or a person.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering NER Response 1 as the correct identification, where \"Mauritius\" is identified as a location."},
