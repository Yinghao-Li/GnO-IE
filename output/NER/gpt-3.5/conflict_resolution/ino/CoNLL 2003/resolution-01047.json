NER Response 1 identifies \"school\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies \"School\" as an organization. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"school\" in this context. Based on the given information, it is likely that \"school\" refers to an organization rather than a location. Therefore, we should resolve the conflict by accepting NER Response 2, which identifies \"School\" as an organization.\n\nStep 3: Update the resolved NER results.\n\nResolved NER Response: | Organization |\n|------------------|\n| School           |\n\nThe resolved NER result is \"School\" as an organization."},
