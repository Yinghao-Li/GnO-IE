This conflict arises because \"Belgrade\" can refer to both a location and a sports team.\n\n- Conflict 2: The NER Response 3 does not provide any information about a person, which is expected in this context.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1 resolution: Based on the context provided in the paragraph, it is clear that \"Partizan Belgrade\" refers to a sports team rather than the location itself. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Partizan Belgrade\" as an organization.\n\n- Conflict 2 resolution: The NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant information in this context. Therefore, we can ignore this response as it does not contribute to resolving the conflicts.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Belgrade |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization        |\n|---------------------|\n| Partizan Belgrade   |"},
