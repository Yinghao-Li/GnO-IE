NER Response 1 identifies \"World Cup\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"World Cup\" in this context. \n\nBased on the given paragraph, it is more likely that \"World Cup\" refers to an event or competition rather than a physical location. Therefore, NER Response 2, which identifies \"World Cup\" as an organization, is more accurate.\n\nSo, the conflict is resolved by accepting NER Response 2 as the correct entity type for \"World Cup\"."},
