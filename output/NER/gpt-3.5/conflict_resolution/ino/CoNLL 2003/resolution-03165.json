NER Response 1 identifies it as a location, NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization, and NER Response 3 does not assign any entity type to it.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Northern Ireland\" based on the context provided in the paragraph.\n\nIn the given paragraph, \"Northern Ireland\" is mentioned in the context of a situation and their keenness to win. This suggests that \"Northern Ireland\" is referring to a national team or a group of people representing a region in a competition, rather than a specific location or organization.\n\nTherefore, the correct entity type for \"Northern Ireland\" in this context would be a national team or a group of people, which falls under the entity type \"Organization\". Hence, NER Response 2 is the correct resolution for the conflict.\n\nResolved NER Response: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Northern Ireland |"},
