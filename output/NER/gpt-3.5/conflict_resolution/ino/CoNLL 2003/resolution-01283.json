NER Response 1 identifies \"Meyers\" as a location, while NER Response 3 identifies it as a person. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to consider the context of the paragraph. Without further context, it is difficult to determine if \"Meyers\" refers to a specific location or a person's last name. However, based on the information provided, it is more likely that \"Meyers\" refers to a person's last name.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering \"Meyers\" as a person (NER Response 3) rather than a location (NER Response 1). \n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n| Person |\n|--------|\n| Meyers |"},
