NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct identification for \"Buenos Aires Newsroom\" based on the context. \n\nSince \"Buenos Aires Newsroom\" is followed by a phone number (+541 318 - 0655), it is more likely to be an Organization rather than a Location.
