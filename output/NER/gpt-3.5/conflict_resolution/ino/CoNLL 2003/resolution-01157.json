This could be due to the ambiguity of the term \"Santa Fe\" which can refer to both a location and an organization.\n- There is no conflict between NER Response 2 and NER Response 3 as they identify different entities (\"Santa Fe\" vs. \"Newmont\").\n- There is no conflict between NER Response 1 and NER Response 3 as they identify different entities (\"Santa Fe\" vs. \"Analysts\" and \"Newmont\").\n\nTherefore, there are no conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results."},
