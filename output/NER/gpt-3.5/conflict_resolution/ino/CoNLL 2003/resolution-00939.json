Based on the context of the paragraph, \"Switzerland\" is more likely to be a location rather than an organization. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Switzerland\" as a location.\n- There is no conflict between NER Response 2 and NER Response 3 as they identify different entities.\n\nResolved Named Entities:\n- Location: Switzerland\n- Organization: Coal exports\n- Person: Rosati"},
