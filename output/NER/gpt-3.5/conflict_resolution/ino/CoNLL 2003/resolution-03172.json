NER Response 1 identifies \"Victoria\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we need more context or information about the specific mention of \"Victoria\" in the paragraph. Without additional information, it is difficult to determine whether \"Victoria\" refers to a location or an organization.\n\nHowever, based on the given paragraph, it is more likely that \"Victoria\" refers to a cricket team or an organization rather than a location. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering NER Response 2, which identifies \"Victoria\" as an organization.\n\nStep 3: Final resolved NER results.\n\nBased on the resolution, the final NER results are as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: None\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Victoria     |\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| Jones  |"},
