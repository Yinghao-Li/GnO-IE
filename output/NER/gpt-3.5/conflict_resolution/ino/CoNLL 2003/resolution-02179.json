If it refers to the city of Frankfurt, it should be labeled as a Location. If it refers to an organization named Frankfurt, it should be labeled as an Organization. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the correct entity type.\n\nTo resolve Conflict 2, since the NER Response 3 does not provide any entity type for \"Frankfurt\", we cannot determine the correct entity type without more context or information.\n\nOverall, the conflicts in the NER results cannot be resolved without additional information or context."},
