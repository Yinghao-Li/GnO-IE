Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"HOBART\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: Based on common knowledge, \"Australia\" is a country and not a person. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Australia\" as a location.\n- Conflict 3: Based on the context of the paragraph, \"1996-12-07\" is likely to be a date rather than a person. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"1996\", \"12\", and \"07\" as a date.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n- \"HOBART\" is a location.\n- \"Australia\" is a location.\n- \"1996-12-07\" is a date."},
