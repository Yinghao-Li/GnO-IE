Norilsk is actually the name of an organization, as mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, NER Response 1 is incorrect.\n\nNER Response 2 correctly identifies \"Norilsk\" as an organization, which matches the information in the paragraph. Therefore, NER Response 2 is correct.\n\nNER Response 3 identifies \"Norilsk\" as a person, which is incorrect. Norilsk is not a person but an organization. Therefore, NER Response 3 is incorrect.\n\nConclusion:\nThe conflict in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results is resolved by accepting NER Response 2, which correctly identifies \"Norilsk\" as an organization."},
