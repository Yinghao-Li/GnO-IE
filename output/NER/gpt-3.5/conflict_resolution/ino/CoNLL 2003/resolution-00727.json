The first conflict is the identification of \"Madrid\" as a location in NER Response 1, while it is identified as an organization in NER Response 2. To resolve this conflict, we need more context or information about the specific mention of \"Madrid\" in the paragraph. If it refers to the city, then NER Response 1 is correct.
