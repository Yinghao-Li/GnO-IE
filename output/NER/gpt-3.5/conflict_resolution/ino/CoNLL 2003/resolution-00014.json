Both \"Japan\" and \"Syrian penalty area\" are correctly identified as named entities.\n\nNER Response 2:\n- There is a conflict in this response. \"Syria\" is identified as an organization, which is incorrect. It should be identified as a location, similar to \"Japan\" in the same response.\n\nNER Response 3:\n- There is a conflict in this response. No named entities are identified, but \"Japan\" and \"Syrian penalty area\" should have been recognized.\n\nStep 3: Resolve Conflicts\nBased on the conflicts identified, the correct NER results should be:\n- Japan: Location\n- Syrian penalty area: Location\n- Syrian defence: None (not a named entity)\n\nTherefore, the resolved NER results are:\n| Location |\n|----------|\n| Japan |\n| Syrian penalty area |"},
