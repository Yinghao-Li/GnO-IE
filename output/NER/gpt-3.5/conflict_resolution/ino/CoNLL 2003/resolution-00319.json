This is a conflict because \"West Indies\" can refer to both a location and a cricket team.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity types for the named entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n- \"West Indies\" can refer to both a location and a cricket team. Since the paragraph does not provide any context to determine the intended meaning, it is best to consider it as both a location and an organization.\n\n- The named entities mentioned after \"West Indies\" are all cricketers, so they should be labeled as \"Person\" entities.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: \n- Location: West Indies\n\nNER Response 2: \n- Organization: West Indies\n- Organization: West Indies cricket team\n\nNER Response 3:\n- Person: Sherwin Campbell\n- Person: Robert Samuels\n- Person: Brian Lara\n- Person: Shivnarine Chanderpaul\n- Person: Carl Hooper\n- Person: Jimmy Adams\n- Person: Junior Murray\n- Person: Nixon McLean\n- Person: Kenneth Benjamin\n- Person: Curtly Ambrose\n- Person: Courtney Walsh\n- Person: Roland Holder (12th man)"},
