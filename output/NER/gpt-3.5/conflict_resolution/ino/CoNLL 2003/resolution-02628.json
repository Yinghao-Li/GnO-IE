NER Response 1 identifies \"Austria\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies \"Austria I\" as an organization. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct identification for the named entity \"Austria\". \n\nBased on the context provided in the paragraph, it is likely that \"Austria I\" refers to a team or a group representing Austria in a certain event or competition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider \"Austria I\" as an organization rather than a location. \n\nHence, the conflicts in the NER results can be resolved by considering \"Austria I\" as an organization."},
