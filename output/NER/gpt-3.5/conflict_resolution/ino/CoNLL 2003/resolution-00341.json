Therefore, NER Response 2 is incorrect in identifying them as organizations. The correct identification for \"China\" and \"Indonesia\" should be as locations.\n\n- \"Ye Zhaoying\" and \"Meiluawati\" are mentioned as individuals who participated in a competition. Therefore, NER Response 3 is correct in identifying them as persons.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the conflicts in the NER results can be resolved as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|  China   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| China        |\n| Indonesia    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person       |\n|--------------|\n| Ye Zhaoying  |\n| Meiluawati   |"},
