Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 2, which identifies \"John Lewis UK\" as an organization.\n\n- Conflict 2 resolution: Since the paragraph does not provide enough information to determine whether \"John Lewis\" refers to a person or an organization, we cannot definitively resolve this conflict. However, based on common knowledge, \"John Lewis\" is a well-known retail company, so it is more likely that NER Response 2, identifying \"John Lewis UK\" as an organization, is correct.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization     |\n|------------------|\n| John Lewis UK    |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization     |\n|------------------|\n| John Lewis UK    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization     |\n|------------------|\n| John Lewis UK    |"},
