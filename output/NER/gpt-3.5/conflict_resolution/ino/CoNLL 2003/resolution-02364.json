Conflict 1: \"Singapore\" is identified as both a location and an organization. Since the context suggests that it is referring to the location, we can resolve this conflict by considering it as a location.\n\n2. Conflict 2: The pronoun \"he\" is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, so it is unclear who it refers to. To resolve this conflict, we need more information or context to identify the person being referred to.\n\nTherefore, the resolved NER results would be:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|-----------|\n| Singapore |\n\nNER Response 2: | Person |\n|--------|\n|   he   |"},
