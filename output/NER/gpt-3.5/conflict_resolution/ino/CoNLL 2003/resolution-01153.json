However, there is a potential conflict in the identification of \"Wall Street\" as a location in NER Response 1, while it is not mentioned as an organization in NER Response 2.\n\nStep 2: Resolve conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we need to determine whether \"Wall Street\" refers to a location or an organization in the given paragraph. Based on the context, \"Wall Street\" is being referred to as a list, which suggests that it is being used as a metonym for the financial industry or the stock market. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider \"Wall Street\" as an organization rather than a location.\n\nResolved NER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Wall Street |\n\nResolved NER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Homestake Mining Co |\n| Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp |\n| Newmont Mining Corp |\n\nNER Response 3 remains unchanged as it correctly identifies the named entities as persons.\n\nFinal resolved NER results:\n\n| Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Wall Street |\n| Homestake Mining Co |\n| Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp |\n| Newmont Mining Corp |\n\n| Person |\n|--------|\n| Homestake Mining Co |\n| Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp |\n| Newmont Mining Corp |"},
