NER Response 1 identifies \"China\" as a location, while NER Response 3 identifies \"Chinese girl\" as a person. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for the term \"Chinese girl.\" Based on the context of the paragraph, it is more likely that \"Chinese girl\" refers to a person rather than a location. Therefore, we can conclude that NER Response 3 is correct in identifying \"Chinese girl\" as a person.\n\nAs a result, the resolved NER results would be:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|          |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n|              |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person       |\n|--------------|\n| Chinese girl |"},
