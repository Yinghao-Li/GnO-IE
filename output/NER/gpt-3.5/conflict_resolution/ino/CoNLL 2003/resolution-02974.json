NER Response 1 identifies it as a \"Location\", NER Response 2 identifies it as an \"Organization\", and NER Response 3 does not identify it as any specific named entity type.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need more context or information about the term \"Tranmere\". Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the correct named entity type for \"Tranmere\". It could refer to a location, an organization, or even a person, depending on the context.\n\nTherefore, the conflicts in the NER results cannot be resolved without further information."},
