Conflict 2: The entity \"William Hill\" is identified as an organization in NER Response 2, but it is identified as a person in NER Response 3.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n1. Conflict 1: The entity \"UK\" is correctly identified as a location in NER Response 1. There is no conflict to resolve.\n\n2.
