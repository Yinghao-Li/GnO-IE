NER Response 1 identifies it as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. This discrepancy needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need more context or information about the entity \"MILWAUKEE\". Without additional information, it is difficult to determine whether \"MILWAUKEE\" refers to a location or an organization. It could potentially be both, as \"MILWAUKEE\" can refer to the city of Milwaukee as well as various organizations based in Milwaukee.\n\nTo provide a more accurate identification, it would be helpful to have more context or information about the specific entity being referred to in the paragraph."},
