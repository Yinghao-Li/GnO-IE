NER Response 2 identified it as an organization, while NER Response 3 did not identify it at all. To resolve this conflict, we can consider \"City\" as both an organization and a location, as it refers to a specific city.\n\nResolved Named Entities:\n- Organization: City\n- Location: City\n\nNote: The term \"floating rate debt\" is not identified as a named entity in any of the NER responses, but it can be considered a financial concept rather than a specific named entity."},
