NER Response 1 identifies it as a \"Location\", NER Response 2 identifies it as an \"Organization\", and NER Response 3 does not identify it as any named entity type.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct named entity type for \"West Ham\" based on the context provided in the paragraph. However, the paragraph itself does not provide enough information to determine the correct named entity type for \"West Ham\". \n\nWithout additional context, it is difficult to determine whether \"West Ham\" refers to a location, an organization, or something else entirely. Therefore, the conflicts in the NER results cannot be resolved without further information."},
