In NER Response 2, both \"Anaheim\" and \"Pittsburgh\" are identified as organizations, but it is unclear which one is the correct entity type for \"Pittsburgh.\"\n\n2. In NER Response 3, no named entities are identified, which is inconsistent with the other responses.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity types for the named entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nBased on the context, \"Anaheim\" is most likely a location (referring to Anaheim, California), not an organization. Therefore, in NER Response 2, the entity type for \"Anaheim\" should be changed from \"Organization\" to \"Location.\"\n\nAdditionally, since no named entities are mentioned in NER Response 3, it can be considered as an incorrect response and can be disregarded.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location   |\n|------------|\n| Pittsburgh |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Anaheim      |\n| Pittsburgh   |\n\nNote: The resolved NER results may vary depending on the context and domain knowledge."},
