Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and disregarding NER Response 2.\n- Conflict 2: Since NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity, we can disregard it and rely on NER Response 1 for the identification of \"INDIANAPOLIS\" as a Location.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n- \"INDIANAPOLIS\" is identified as a Location."},
