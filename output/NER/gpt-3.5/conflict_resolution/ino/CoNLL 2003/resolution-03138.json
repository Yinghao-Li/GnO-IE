Conflict 1: The entity \"Zimbabwe\" is identified as a location in NER Response 1, but as an organization in NER Response 2.\n\nResolution: Based on the context of the paragraph, it is more likely that \"Zimbabwe\" refers to a location rather than an organization. Therefore, we should resolve this conflict by considering \"Zimbabwe\" as a location.\n\n2. Conflict 2: NER Response 3 identifies an entity as a person, but does not provide any specific name or information.\n\nResolution: Since there is no specific name or information provided, it is not possible to determine the correct entity type. Therefore, we should consider this conflict as unresolved.\n\nAfter resolving the conflicts, the updated NER results would be:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Zimbabwe |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Zimbabwe Open |\n\nNER Response 3: | Unresolved |\n|--------------|\n|        |"},
