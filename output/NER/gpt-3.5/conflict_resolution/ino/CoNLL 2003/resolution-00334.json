Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering \"Taiwan\" as a nationality or origin, which falls under the named entity type \"Location\".\n\nStep 3: Update the resolved conflicts.\n\nResolved NER Response: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Taiwan   |\n\nNow, the conflict in the NER results has been resolved, and \"Taiwan\" is identified as a location."},
