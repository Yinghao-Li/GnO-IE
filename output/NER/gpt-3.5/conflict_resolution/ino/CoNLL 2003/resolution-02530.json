Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and disregarding NER Response 2.\n- Conflict 2: Since NER Response 2 does not provide any information about \"Colorado\", we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1.\n- Conflict 3: None of the NER responses provide any information about the date \"1996-12-07\". Therefore, we cannot resolve this conflict based on the given NER responses.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\n- Location: Vail, Colorado\n- Organization: None identified\n- Person: None identified\n- Date: 1996-12-07"},
