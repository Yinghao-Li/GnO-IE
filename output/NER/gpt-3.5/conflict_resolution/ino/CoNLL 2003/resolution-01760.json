NER Response 1 identifies \"U.S.\" as a Location.\n2. NER Response 2 identifies \"U.S. barges\" as an Organization.\n3. NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for the named entity \"U.S. barges lightly quoted on call session\" based on the context provided. \n\nSince \"U.S. barges\" refers to a specific type of barges and not a location or a person, we can conclude that NER Response 2 is the most accurate. Therefore, the resolved conflict is as follows:\n\nResolved NER Response: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| U.S. barges  |"},
