  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the given NER responses, there are conflicts in the named entity recognition results. \n\n1. The first conflict is between NER Response 1 and NER Response 2. NER Response 1 identifies \"Omaha\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies \"OMAHA\" as an organization. To resolve this conflict, we can consider \"Omaha\" as the correct entity since it is a known city, and \"OMAHA\" might be a misinterpretation or an incorrect capitalization of the city name.\n\n2. The second conflict is between NER Response 2 and NER Response 3. NER Response 2 identifies \"OMAHA\" as an organization, while NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity. To resolve this conflict, we can assume that NER Response 2 is incorrect in identifying \"OMAHA\" as an organization since it is more likely to be a location or a city name. Therefore, NER Response 3, which does not identify any named entity, is more accurate in this case.\n\nSo, the resolved named entity recognition results would be:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Omaha    |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n|        |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
