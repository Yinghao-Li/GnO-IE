NER Response 1 identifies \"Atalanta\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine whether \"Atalanta\" refers to a location or an organization in this context. \n\nBased on the information provided in the paragraph, it is more likely that \"Atalanta\" refers to a football club, which would make it an organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by accepting NER Response 2, which identifies \"Atalanta\" as an organization.\n\nStep 3: Check for any additional conflicts.\n\nThere are no conflicts in the NER results for the entity \"Filippo Inzaghi\". NER Response 3 correctly identifies \"Filippo Inzaghi\" as a person.\n\nOverall, the conflicts in the NER results have been resolved by accepting NER Response 2 for \"Atalanta\" as an organization and NER Response 3 for \"Filippo Inzaghi\" as a person."},
