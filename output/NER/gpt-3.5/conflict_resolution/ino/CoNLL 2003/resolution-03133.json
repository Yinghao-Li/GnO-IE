NER Response 1 identifies \"Australia\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for the word \"Australia\" in the given context. Since the paragraph is about a rugby match and mentions players' names, it is more likely that \"Australia\" refers to a national rugby team, which would make it an organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering NER Response 2 as the correct entity type for \"Australia\".\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Australia |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Australia    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person         |\n|----------------|\n| Matthew Burke  |\n| Joe Roff       |\n| David Campese  |\n| Tim Horan      |"},
