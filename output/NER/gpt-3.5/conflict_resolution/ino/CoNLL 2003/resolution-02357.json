Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting the label \"Location\" for \"Singapore\".\n\nConflict 2: There is no mention of a person named \"Supple\" in the paragraph. This could be a misinterpretation or an error in the NER results. To resolve this conflict, we can remove the label \"Person\" for \"Supple\" since there is no evidence to support it.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|-----------|\n| Singapore |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|-----------|\n| Singapore |\n\nNER Response 3: | - |\n|---------|\n| - |\n\nNote: The conflicts have been resolved by accepting the label \"Location\" for \"Singapore\" and removing the label \"Person\" for \"Supple\"."},
