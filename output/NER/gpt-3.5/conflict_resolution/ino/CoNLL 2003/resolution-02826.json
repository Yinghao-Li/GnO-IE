Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"West Hartlepool\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: Since there is no mention of \"Orrell\" being an organization in the paragraph, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 2 for \"West Hartlepool\" as an organization and ignoring the mention of \"Orrell\" as an organization.\n- Conflict 3: Since the paragraph mentions \"Orrell\" without specifying its entity type, we cannot definitively resolve this conflict. We can consider \"Orrell\" as a potential named entity, but its entity type remains unknown.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\n- Location: West Hartlepool\n- Organization: West Hartlepool\n- Potential Named Entity: Orrell"},
