The conflicts are as follows:\n\n1. Conflict between NER Response 1 and NER Response 2:\n   - NER Response 1 identifies \"Leicester\" as a location.\n   - NER Response 2 identifies \"Leicester\" as both a location and an organization.\n\n2. Conflict between NER Response 2 and NER Response 3:\n   - NER Response 2 identifies \"Blackburn\" as an organization.\n   - NER Response 3 identifies \"Blackburn\" as a person.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct identification of the named entities based on the context provided in the paragraph.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, we can resolve the conflicts as follows:\n\n1. \"Leicester\" is mentioned as a location in the paragraph, so NER Response 1 is correct in identifying it as a location.\n\n2. \"Blackburn\" is mentioned without any context indicating it as an organization or a person. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct identification based on the given information. It could be either an organization or a person.\n\nTherefore, the resolved conflicts are as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location  |\n|-----------|\n| Leicester |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Leicester    |\n| Blackburn    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person  |\n|---------|\n| Sutton  |"},
