It is not clear from the paragraph which one is correct.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nConflict 1: Since it is not clear from the paragraph whether \"Codos\" is a location or an organization, we cannot definitively resolve this conflict based on the given information.\n\nConflict 2: Based on the context of the paragraph, it is more likely that \"Mutineers\" refers to a group of people rather than an organization. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Mutineers\" as a Person entity.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|   Codos  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n|              |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person       |\n|--------------|\n| Mutineers    |"},
