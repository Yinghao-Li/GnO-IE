In this context, \"Denver\" and \"Green Bay\" are most likely referring to sports teams, which would make them organizations.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering NER Response 2 as the correct identification, where \"Denver\" and \"Green Bay\" are identified as organizations."},
