This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity, but there is a named entity \"Teamsystem Bologna\" in the paragraph. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1 resolution: Based on the context of the paragraph, it is likely that \"Teamsystem Bologna\" refers to an organization rather than just the location \"Bologna\". Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Teamsystem Bologna\" as an organization.\n\n- Conflict 2 resolution: NER Response 3 does not provide any information about the named entity \"Teamsystem Bologna\". However, since \"Teamsystem Bologna\" is mentioned in the paragraph, we can consider it as an organization. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Teamsystem Bologna\" as an organization.\n\nUpdated NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Bologna  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Teamsystem Bologna |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------|\n| Teamsystem Bologna |"},
