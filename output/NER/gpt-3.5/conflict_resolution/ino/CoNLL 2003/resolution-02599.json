They provide different types of named entities, with NER Response 1 focusing on locations and NER Response 2 focusing on organizations.\n\nHowever, there is a conflict between NER Response 2 and NER Response 3. NER Response 2 identifies \"Canadians\" as an organization, while NER Response 3 identifies it as a person.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nBased on the context of the paragraph, \"Canadians\" refers to a group of people, not an organization. Therefore, NER Response 3 is correct in identifying \"Canadians\" as a person.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we can update NER Response 2 to identify \"Canadians\" as a person instead of an organization.\n\nUpdated NER Response 2: \n\n| Person       |\n|--------------|\n| Canadians    |\n| World Cup    |\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with!"},
