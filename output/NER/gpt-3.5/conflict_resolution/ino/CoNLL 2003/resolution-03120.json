Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the correct identification of the named entities.\n\nHowever, based on the given paragraph, it is likely that \"Wrexham\" and \"Scunthorpe\" are both locations, as they are mentioned in the context of a sports match. Therefore, we can resolve the conflicts as follows:\n\nResolved NER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Wrexham  |\n\nResolved NER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Wrexham      |\n| Scunthorpe   |\n\nResolved NER Response 3: | Location |\n|--------|\n|        |\n\nNote: The resolution is based on the assumption that \"Wrexham\" and \"Scunthorpe\" are locations. If there is additional information or context that suggests otherwise, the resolution may change."},
