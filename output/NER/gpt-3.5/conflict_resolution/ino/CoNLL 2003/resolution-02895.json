If the paragraph is discussing the Scottish league as a sports organization, then the second NER response is correct. However, if the paragraph is referring to the location of the Scottish league, then the first NER response is correct. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the correct identification.\n\n2. Conflict 2: The third NER response identifies a person, but there is no mention of any person in the paragraph.\n\nResolution: This conflict can be resolved by removing the third NER response as it does not correspond to any named entity mentioned in the paragraph."},
