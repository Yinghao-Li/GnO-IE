Therefore, we should remove \"Budapest\" as a separate location entity and consider it as part of the organization entity \"Budapest Bank\".\n\nUpdated NER Response: \n\n| Organization    |\n|-----------------|\n| Budapest Bank   |\n\nStep 3: Identify and resolve any additional conflicts.\n\nThere are no conflicts in the identification of the person entity \"Sandor Tolonics\" in NER Response 3.\n\nFinal NER Response:\n\n| Organization    |\n|-----------------|\n| Budapest Bank   |\n\n| Person           |\n|------------------|\n| Sandor Tolonics  |"},
