NER Response 1 identifies \"Indiana\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity for \"Indiana\".\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct named entity type for \"Indiana\" based on the context provided in the paragraph. However, the paragraph itself does not provide enough information to determine the correct named entity type for \"Indiana\". It could refer to the state of Indiana, an organization named Indiana, or a person named Indiana.\n\nWithout additional context, it is not possible to definitively resolve the conflicts in the NER results."},
