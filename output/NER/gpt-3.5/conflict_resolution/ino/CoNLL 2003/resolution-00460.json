Response 1 identifies \"UTAH\" as a location, while Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n- There is no conflict with NER Response 3 as it does not identify any named entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Since the given paragraph does not provide enough context, it is difficult to determine whether \"UTAH\" refers to a location or an organization.
