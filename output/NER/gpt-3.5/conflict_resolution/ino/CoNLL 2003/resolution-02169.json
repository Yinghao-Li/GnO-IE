This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nNER Response 3 identifies a named entity as a person, but there is no mention of any person in the paragraph. This conflict needs to be resolved as well.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nBased on the context of the paragraph, it is clear that \"Munich\" refers to the city, not the organization \"Munich Re\". Therefore, NER Response 2 is incorrect in identifying \"Munich\" as an organization. The correct resolution is to remove the organization entity from NER Response 2.\n\nSimilarly, since there is no mention of any person in the paragraph, NER Response 3 is incorrect in identifying a person entity. The correct resolution is to remove the person entity from NER Response 3.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Munich   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n|              |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
