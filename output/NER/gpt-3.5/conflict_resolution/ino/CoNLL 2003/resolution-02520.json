However, in this context, it is more likely to refer to the country. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering \"Germany\" as a Location.\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant information for \"Germany\". Therefore, we can ignore this response.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Germany  |"},
