This conflict arises because NER Response 1 does not recognize \"Italy commission\" as an entity.\n\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 2 identifies \"Italy commission\" as an organization, but NER Response 3 does not identify any person entities. This conflict arises because NER Response 2 identifies \"Italy commission\" as an entity, but NER Response 3 does not recognize any person entities related to the commission.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1 resolution: Merge the entities identified in NER Response 1 and NER Response 2. The correct entity should be \"Italy commission\" as an organization.\n\n- Conflict 2 resolution: NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant information in this case, so it can be ignored.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Italy commission |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Italy commission |"},
