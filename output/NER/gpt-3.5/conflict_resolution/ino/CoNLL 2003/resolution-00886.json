However, NER Response 3 conflicts with NER Response 2 because \"Violence monitors\" is identified as an organization in NER Response 2 but as a person in NER Response 3.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Violence monitors\" based on the context. In this case, \"Violence monitors\" refers to a group or organization that monitors violence, so it should be classified as an organization. Therefore, NER Response 2 is the correct identification for \"Violence monitors\".\n\nResolved conflicts:\n\nNER Response 1: Location entity - KwaZulu-Natal\nNER Response 2: Organization entity - Violence monitors\n\nStep 3: Provide the resolved conflicts.\n\nThe conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results have been resolved as follows:\n\n| Entity Type     | Entity Name       |\n|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Location        | KwaZulu-Natal     |\n| Organization    | Violence monitors |"},
