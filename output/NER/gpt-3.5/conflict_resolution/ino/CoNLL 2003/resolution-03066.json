To resolve this conflict, we need to determine whether \"Stenhousemuir\" is a location or an organization.\n\n- Since \"Livingston\" is also mentioned in NER Response 2 as an organization, it is likely that \"Stenhousemuir\" is also an organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering \"Stenhousemuir\" as an organization, as indicated in NER Response 2.\n\n- NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant information to resolve the conflicts.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n- \"Livingston\" is an organization.\n- \"Stenhousemuir\" is an organization."},
