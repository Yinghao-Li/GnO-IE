Additionally, Response 3 does not provide any entity type for \"NAC Breda\".\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need more context or information about \"NAC Breda\". Without additional information, it is difficult to determine whether \"NAC Breda\" refers to a location or an organization. It is also not clear if it refers to a person, as Response 3 does not provide any entity type.\n\nTo resolve these conflicts, we may need to consult additional sources or gather more information about \"NAC Breda\" to determine its correct entity type."},
