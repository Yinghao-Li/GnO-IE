Waugh\" as an organization.\n- NER Response 3 identifies \"M. Waugh\" as a person.\n\nThe conflicts in the NER results are:\n1. NER Response 2 identifies \"M. Waugh\" as an organization, while NER Response 3 identifies it as a person.\n2. NER Response 2 and NER Response 3 both identify \"M. Waugh\" as a named entity, but they differ in the type of entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need more context or information about \"M. Waugh\". Without additional information, it is difficult to determine whether \"M. Waugh\" refers to an organization or a person. It is also possible that \"M. Waugh\" could be a location, as suggested by NER Response 1.\n\nTherefore, without further context, it is not possible to definitively resolve the conflicts in the NER results."},
