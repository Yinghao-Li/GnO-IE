Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"TIGNES\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: Since there is no mention of \"France\" being an organization or a person, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"France\" as a location.\n- Conflict 3: NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant information, so we can ignore it.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\n- \"TIGNES\" is a location.\n- \"France\" is a location."},
