NER Response 1 identifies \"Waha\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. These conflicting results need to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to consider the context of the paragraph. In this case, \"Waha\" is most likely referring to a location rather than an organization. The paragraph mentions \"Physical prices at Waha\" and \"milder weather moved into the Southwest\", which suggests that \"Waha\" is a location related to energy prices and weather.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering \"Waha\" as a location.\n\nUpdated NER Response: | Location |\n|----------|\n|   Waha   |"},
