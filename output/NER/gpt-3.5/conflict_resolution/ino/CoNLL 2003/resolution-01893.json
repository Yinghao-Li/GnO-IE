NER Response 1 identifies \"Indian\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies \"Indian Sept\" as an organization.\n- To resolve this conflict, we need more context or information about the specific entity being referred to. Without additional information, it is difficult to determine whether \"Indian\" refers to a location or an organization.\n\nStep 3: Identify Missing Entities\n- NER Response 3 does not identify any named entities in the given paragraph. However, it is possible that there are other entities present in the paragraph that were not identified by the NER system.\n\nOverall, the conflicts in the NER results cannot be fully resolved without additional context or information."},
