Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Scarborough\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: Since there is no mention of \"Chesterfield\" being an organization in the paragraph, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 2 for \"Scarborough\" as a location and removing \"Chesterfield\" as an organization.\n- Conflict 3: NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant information, so we can ignore it.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n- Location: Scarborough\n- Organization: None identified\n- Person: None identified"},
