The conflicts arise in the identification of \"Chelsea\" and \"Everton\" as either a Location or an Organization. Additionally, there is a conflict in the identification of \"Zola,\" \"Vialli,\" and \"Branch\" as either a Person or some other entity type.\n\nStep 2: Resolve conflicts in the named entity recognition (NER) results.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need more context or information about the entities mentioned in the paragraph. Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the correct entity types for \"Chelsea\" and \"Everton.\" Similarly, without more context, it is challenging to determine the correct entity type for \"Zola,\" \"Vialli,\" and \"Branch.\"\n\nTherefore, the conflicts in the NER results cannot be resolved without further information."},
