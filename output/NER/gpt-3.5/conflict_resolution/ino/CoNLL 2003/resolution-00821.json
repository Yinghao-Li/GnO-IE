Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Bologna\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: Since NER Response 1 does not provide any entity for \"Piacenza,\" we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Piacenza\" as a location, similar to \"Bologna.\"\n- Conflict 3: NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant entities, so we can ignore this response.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Bologna  |\n| Piacenza |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Bologna      |\n| Piacenza     |"},
