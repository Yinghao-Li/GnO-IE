Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering NER Response 2 as the correct identification.\n- Conflict 2: Since NER Response 3 does not identify any named entities, we can consider it as incorrect or incomplete. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by disregarding NER Response 3.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Twente   |\n| Enschede |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Twente Enschede |"},
