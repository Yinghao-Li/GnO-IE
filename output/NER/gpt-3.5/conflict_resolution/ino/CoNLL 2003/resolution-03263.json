The capitalization difference between the two responses suggests a conflict in the identification of the named entity.\n\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 states that there is no named entity identified as a person, which is expected as there is no mention of a person in the paragraph.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1: The correct identification of the named entity in this case would be \"New Jersey\" as a location. The capitalization in NER Response 2 seems to be incorrect, as it should match the capitalization in the paragraph.\n\n- Conflict 2: There is no conflict in NER Response 3, as there is no mention of a person in the paragraph.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| New Jersey |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| New Jersey   |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| None   |"},
