In this case, since the paragraph is about a sports event, it is more appropriate to identify \"China\" as a location.\n\n- \"Ye Zhaoying\" and \"Gong Zhichao\" are both persons, and their identification as such is correct.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n- \"China\" should be identified as a location.\n- \"Ye Zhaoying\" and \"Gong Zhichao\" should be identified as persons."},
