Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Verona\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: Since NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity, we cannot resolve this conflict. We need more information or context to determine if \"Napoli\" refers to a person or an organization.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Verona   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Napoli       |\n| Verona       |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
