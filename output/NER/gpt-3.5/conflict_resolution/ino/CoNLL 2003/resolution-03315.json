Therefore, it should be identified as an organization, as in NER Response 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can resolve the conflicts by combining the correct identifications from NER Response 1 and NER Response 2:\n\nResolved NER Response: | Location     | Organization |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Indiana         | Golden State |\n\nThis resolved NER response correctly identifies \"Indiana\" as a location and \"Golden State\" as an organization, which aligns with the information provided in the paragraph."},
