Therefore, it should not be identified as a location.\n- \"Madrid\" and \"Barcelona\" are both cities, so they should be identified as locations rather than organizations.\n- \"Real Madrid\" and \"Barcelona\" are both football clubs, so they should be identified as organizations rather than locations.\n- NER Response 3 does not provide any named entities, so it does not conflict with the other responses.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: \n- Event: Soccer Showcase\n- Location: Madrid, Barcelona\n\nNER Response 2: \n- Organization: Real Madrid, Barcelona\n\nNER Response 3: \n- No named entities identified."},
