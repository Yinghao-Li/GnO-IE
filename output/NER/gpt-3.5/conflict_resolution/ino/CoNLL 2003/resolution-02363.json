This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nConflict 2: The entity \"Singapore government\" is mentioned in NER Response 3, but it is not identified as an organization. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve Conflict 1, we need to determine whether \"Singapore\" refers to the location or the government. Based on the context of the paragraph, it is more likely that \"Singapore\" refers to the government. Therefore, we will consider \"Singapore government\" as the correct entity.\n\nTo resolve Conflict 2, we need to identify the correct entity type for \"Singapore government.\" Since it is a governing body, it should be classified as an organization. Therefore, we will consider \"Singapore government\" as an organization.\n\nUpdated NER Response:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location  |\n|-----------|\n| Singapore |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization               |\n|----------------------------|\n| WTO (World Trade Organization) |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization        |\n|---------------|\n| Singapore government |"},
