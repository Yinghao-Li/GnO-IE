NER Response 1 identifies it as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct identification of the named entity \"Central Africa\" based on the context of the paragraph.\n\nIn this case, \"Central Africa\" is most likely referring to a location rather than an organization. Therefore, NER Response 1, which identifies it as a location, is the correct identification.\n\nStep 3: Update the resolved conflicts.\n\nAfter resolving the conflicts, the updated NER results are as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location       |\n|----------------|\n| Central Africa |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person        |\n|---------------|\n| Ex-minister   |\n\nThe conflicts in the NER results have been identified and resolved."},
