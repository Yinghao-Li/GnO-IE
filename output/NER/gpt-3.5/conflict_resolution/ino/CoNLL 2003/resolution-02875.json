Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering \"Coventry\" as an organization.\n- \"Tottenham\" is also a football team, so it should be considered as an organization as well.\n- \"Sheringham\" is a person who scored a goal for Tottenham, so it should be considered as a person.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Coventry     |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Coventry     |\n| Tottenham    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person     |\n|------------|\n| Sheringham |"},
