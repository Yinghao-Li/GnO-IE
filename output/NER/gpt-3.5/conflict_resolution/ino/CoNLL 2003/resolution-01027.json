However, there is a potential conflict between NER Response 2 and NER Response 3. NER Response 2 identifies \"Elf\" as an organization, while NER Response 3 identifies \"Elf refinery workers\" as a person. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we need to determine whether \"Elf\" refers to the organization or the workers. In the context of the paragraph, it is clear that \"Elf\" refers to the organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering NER Response 2 as the correct identification.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location     |\n|--------------|\n| Mediterranean|\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Elf          |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person               |\n|----------------------|\n| Elf refinery workers |"},
