NER Response 1 identifies it as a \"Location\", while NER Response 2 identifies it as an \"Organization\". This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct label for the named entity \"institute\" based on the context provided in the paragraph. In this case, the phrase \"The institute\" suggests that it is referring to a specific organization rather than a general location. Therefore, NER Response 2, which identifies it as an \"Organization\", is the correct label.\n\nResolved NER Results: \nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|            |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| The institute |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
