This is because \"Ross County\" is more commonly known as a football club, which falls under the category of an organization.\n- NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant information, so it can be ignored.\n\nResolved NER Results: \n- \"Ross County\" is identified as an organization.\n- \"Montrose\" is identified as a location."},
