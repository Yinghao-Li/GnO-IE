Response 1 identifies \"Republic of Ireland\" as a location, while Response 2 identifies it as an organization. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine whether \"Republic of Ireland\" should be classified as a location or an organization in this context. \n\nIn this paragraph, \"Republic of Ireland\" is referring to a national football team, which is typically associated with an organization rather than a location. Therefore, we can conclude that NER Response 2 is more accurate in this case, and \"Republic of Ireland\" should be classified as an organization.\n\nStep 3: Update the resolved NER results.\n\nResolved NER Response: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Republic of Ireland |\n\nStep 4: Review the remaining NER Response.\n\nNER Response 3 does not conflict with the resolved NER Response, as it does not provide any conflicting information. However, it does not provide any relevant information either, as there are no specific person entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nFinal NER Results: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Republic of Ireland |"},
