This conflict arises because \"AS Roma\" is a football club based in Rome, so it can be considered both a location and an organization.\n\nConflict 2: The NER Response 3 does not provide any entity type for \"Lazio (12)\" and \"AS Roma (7)\". These entities could potentially be identified as organizations or teams.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nResolution 1: Merge the NER Response 1 and NER Response 2 to identify \"AS Roma\" as an organization located in \"Rome\".\n\nResolution 2: Assign the entity type \"Organization\" to \"Lazio (12)\" and \"AS Roma (7)\" in NER Response 3, as they are both football clubs.\n\nUpdated NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|   Rome   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| AS Roma      |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------|\n| Lazio (12) |\n| AS Roma (7) |"},
