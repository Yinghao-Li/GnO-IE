Similarly, \"London Irish\" is also likely to refer to a rugby team or a sports club, making it an organization as well.\n\nTherefore, the conflicts can be resolved as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: \n- Gloucester: Organization\n- London Irish: Organization\n\nNER Response 2: \n- Gloucester: Organization\n- London Irish: Organization\n\nNER Response 3: \n- No named entities identified."},
