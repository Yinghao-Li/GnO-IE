Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Hull\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: Since there is no information in the paragraph about \"Crewe\" being an organization, location, or person, we cannot definitively resolve this conflict. We can consider \"Crewe\" as an unknown entity or exclude it from the named entities altogether.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|   Hull   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Hull         |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
