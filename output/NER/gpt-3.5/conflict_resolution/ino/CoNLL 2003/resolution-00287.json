Without additional information, it is difficult to determine whether Australia refers to a location or an organization in this context.\n\nHowever, based on the mention of cricket and the fact that Australia is playing against West Indies, it is more likely that Australia refers to the national cricket team (Organization) rather than the country (Location). Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering Australia as an Organization.\n\nAdditionally, there is no conflict regarding the identification of West Indies as it was not identified in any of the NER responses."},
