However, based on common knowledge, \"Carlisle\" is more commonly known as a location (a city in England) rather than an organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflicts as follows:\n\n- \"Carlisle\" should be identified as a location.\n- \"Darlington\" should be identified as an organization.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Carlisle |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Darlington   |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
