Therefore, NER Response 2 is correct in identifying it as an Organization.\n\nResolution 2: \"Nancy\" is a city, which makes it a Location. Therefore, NER Response 1 is correct in identifying it as a Location.\n\nResolution 3: \"Bruno N'Gotty\" and \"Paul Fischer\" are both football players, which makes them Persons. Therefore, NER Response 3 is correct in identifying them as Persons.\n\nUpdated NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Nancy |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization        |\n|---------------------|\n| Paris St Germain    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person          |\n|-----------------|\n| Bruno N'Gotty   |\n| Paul Fischer    |\n\nThe conflicts in the NER results have been resolved."},
