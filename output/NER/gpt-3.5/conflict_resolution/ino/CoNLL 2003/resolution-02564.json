Conflict 1: NORDIC SKIING\n   - NER Response 1 identifies \"NORDIC SKIING\" as a location, while NER Response 2 does not mention it.\n   - Resolution: Since NER Response 2 identifies \"World Cup Biathlon\" as an organization, it is likely that \"NORDIC SKIING\" is not a location but rather a sport or event. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"NORDIC SKIING\" as an event or sport rather than a location.\n\n2. Conflict 2: WORLD CUP BIATHLON\n   - NER Response 1 identifies \"WORLD CUP BIATHLON\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n   - Resolution: Based on common knowledge, \"WORLD CUP BIATHLON\" is an international sports event rather than a location.
