Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Asian Cup\" as an Organization, as identified in NER Response 2.\n\nConflict 2: Since the paragraph mentions the results of matches, it is reasonable to assume that there are players involved. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering the players mentioned in the paragraph as Persons. However, since the paragraph does not provide specific names or details about the players, we cannot identify them individually."},
