Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Vail\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 1 identifies \"Colorado\" as a location, and there is no indication in the context that it should be considered as an organization or a person. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Colorado\" as a location.\n- Conflict 3: NER Response 3 does not provide any named entity identification, while NER Response 1 and 2 do. Since NER Response 1 and 2 provide more specific information, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and 2 and considering \"Vail\" and \"Colorado\" as the identified named entities.\n\nResolved Named Entity Recognition (NER) results:\n\n- Named Entity 1: Vail (Location)\n- Named Entity 2: Colorado (Location)"},
