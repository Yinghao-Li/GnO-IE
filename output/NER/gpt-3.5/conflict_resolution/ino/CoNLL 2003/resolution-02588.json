Therefore, it is more likely to be an organization rather than individual persons.\n\nHence, the correct identification and resolution of the conflicts in the NER results would be:\n\nNER Response 1: | None |\n|----------|\n| None     |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Greiner - Petter - Memm 78 |\n\nNER Response 3: | None |\n|--------|\n| None   |"},
