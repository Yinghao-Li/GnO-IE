This is a conflict.\n\nNER Response 1 identifies \"Arizona State\" as a \"Location\" entity, while NER Response 2 does not mention it. This is a conflict.\n\nNER Response 3 identifies \"Pace\" as a \"Person\" entity, which is not conflicting with the other responses.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nBased on the context of the paragraph, \"Ohio State\" and \"Arizona State\" are universities, which are typically considered organizations. Therefore, NER Response 2 is more accurate in this case.\n\n\"Rose Bowl\" refers to a specific football game, which is a location where the game is played.
