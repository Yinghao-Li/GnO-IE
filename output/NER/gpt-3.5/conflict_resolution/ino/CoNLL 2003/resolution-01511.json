  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Step 1: Identify the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results.\n\nNER Response 1 and NER Response 2 conflict in terms of the entity type assigned to \"YIT campus\". NER Response 1 identifies it as a \"Location\" entity, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an \"Organization\" entity.\n\nNER Response 3 does not conflict with the other responses as it identifies \"Institute official\" as a \"Person\" entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"YIT campus\". Based on the context provided in the paragraph, it is more likely that \"YIT campus\" refers to a location rather than an organization. Therefore, we should resolve the conflict by assigning the entity type \"Location\" to \"YIT campus\".\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n| Location      |\n|---------------|\n| YIT campus    |\n\n| Person |\n|--------|\n| Institute official |\n\nThe conflicts have been resolved, and the final NER results are provided above."},
