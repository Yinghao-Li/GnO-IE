Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the correct named entity type for \"MADRID\". \n\nHowever, based on general knowledge, \"MADRID\" is commonly known as the capital city of Spain, which would make it a Location rather than an Organization. Therefore, we can consider NER Response 1 as the more accurate identification.\n\nStep 3: Final resolved conflicts.\n\nThe conflict in the NER results is resolved by considering \"MADRID\" as a Location, as identified in NER Response 1."},
