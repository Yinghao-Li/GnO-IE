NER Response 1 identifies \"Internet\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Internet\" in this context. \n\nIn this paragraph, \"Internet\" refers to a global computer network, which is not a physical location but rather an abstract concept. Therefore, it is more appropriate to classify \"Internet\" as an organization rather than a location. \n\nSo, the correct resolution would be to accept NER Response 2, which identifies \"Internet\" as an organization. \n\nStep 3: Update the resolved NER result.\n\nResolved NER Result: | Organization |\n|------------------|\n| Internet         |\n\nThe resolved NER result identifies \"Internet\" as an organization."},
