NER Response 1 identifies it as a \"Location\" entity, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an \"Organization\" entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nBased on the context of the paragraph, it is more appropriate to consider \"hospital\" as an \"Organization\" entity rather than a \"Location\" entity. Therefore, we should resolve the conflict by accepting NER Response 2 and considering \"hospital\" as an \"Organization\" entity.\n\nStep 3: Identify any additional named entities.\n\nNER Response 3 correctly identifies \"Havel\" as a \"Person\" entity.\n\nFinal resolved NER results:\n\n| Person | Organization |\n|--------|--------------|\n| Havel  | Hospital     |"},
