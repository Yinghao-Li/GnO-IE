NER Response 3 identifies \"Members of the guerrilla group\" as a \"Person\" entity, while NER Response 2 identifies \"Guerrilla group\" as an \"Organization\" entity. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nBased on the context of the paragraph, it is more accurate to consider \"Guerrilla group\" as an \"Organization\" entity rather than a \"Person\" entity. Therefore, the conflict can be resolved by updating NER Response 3 as follows:\n\nNER Response 3: Certainly! Here are the valid \"Organization\" entities mentioned in the paragraph presented as a Markdown table:\n\n| Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Guerrilla group    |\n\nNow the conflicts have been resolved."},
