This is a conflict because \"Yangon\" is not a separate entity in the given paragraph.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, NER Response 2 is the correct identification of named entities. \"University of Yangon\" is the only valid named entity mentioned in the paragraph, so NER Response 1's inclusion of \"Yangon\" as a separate entity is incorrect.\n\nStep 3: Provide the resolved conflicts.\n\nThe conflict in the NER results is resolved by accepting NER Response 2 as the correct identification of named entities. The resolved conflict is as follows:\n\nNER Response 2: Certainly! Here are the valid \"Organization\" entities presented as a Markdown table:\n\n| Organization         |\n|----------------------|\n| University of Yangon |"},
