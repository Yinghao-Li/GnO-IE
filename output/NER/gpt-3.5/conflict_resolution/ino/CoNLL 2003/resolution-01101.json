Therefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering NER Response 2 as the correct identification for \"Manitoba Pork\" as an organization.\n\nResolved NER Results: \nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Manitoba |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization     |\n|------------------|\n| Manitoba Pork    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
