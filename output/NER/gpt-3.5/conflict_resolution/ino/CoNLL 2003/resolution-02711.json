Therefore, it should be identified as an organization.\n- \"Indonesia\" is also mentioned in the context of a sports event, so it should be identified as an organization as well.\n- \"Sun Jun\" and \"Allan Budi Kusuma\" are mentioned as participants in the sports event, so they should be identified as persons.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| China        |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| China        |\n| Indonesia    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| Sun Jun |\n| Allan Budi Kusuma |"},
