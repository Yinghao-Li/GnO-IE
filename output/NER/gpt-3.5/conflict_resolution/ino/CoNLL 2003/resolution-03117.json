Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and discarding NER Response 2's identification of \"Sudbury Town\" as an organization.\n- Conflict 2: Since there is no mention of \"Brentford\" in the given paragraph, we cannot determine its correct identification. Therefore, we cannot resolve this conflict without additional information.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location       |\n|----------------|\n| Sudbury Town   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| None           |"},
