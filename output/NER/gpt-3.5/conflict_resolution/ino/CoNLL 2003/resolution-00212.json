NER Response 1 identifies \"Macedonia\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. NER Response 3 does not provide any identification for \"Macedonia\".\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct identification for the named entity \"Macedonia\" based on the context provided in the paragraph.\n\nIn the given paragraph, \"Macedonia\" is mentioned in the context of a soccer match. Based on this context, it is more likely that \"Macedonia\" refers to a national soccer team or a country participating in the match, rather than a location or an organization.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve the conflicts by identifying \"Macedonia\" as an organization (national soccer team) in this context.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Macedonia    |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Macedonia    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Macedonia    |"},
