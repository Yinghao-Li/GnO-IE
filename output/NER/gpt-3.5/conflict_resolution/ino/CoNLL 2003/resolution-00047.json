Specifically, the conflicts are:\n\n1. In NER Response 1, \"Syria\" is identified as a location.\n2. In NER Response 2, \"Syria\" is identified as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct identification for the named entity \"Syria\". \n\nBased on the context of the paragraph, it is more likely that \"Syria\" refers to a location rather than an organization. Therefore, we can conclude that NER Response 1 is correct in identifying \"Syria\" as a location.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: \n- Location: Syria\n\nNER Response 3:\n- Person: Salem Bitar, Bachar Srour, Hassan Abbas, Tarek Jabban, Ammar Awad, Nihad al-Boushi, Mohammed Afash, Ali Dib, Abdul Latif Helou, Khaled Zaher, Nader Jokhadar"},
