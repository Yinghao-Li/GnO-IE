NER Response 1 identifies \"Notts County\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. Additionally, NER Response 3 does not provide any entity type for \"Notts County\".\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need more context or information about \"Notts County\". Without additional information, it is difficult to determine whether \"Notts County\" refers to a location or an organization. It could potentially be both, as \"Notts County\" could refer to a county or a football club.\n\nTherefore, the conflicts in the NER results cannot be resolved without further context or information."},
