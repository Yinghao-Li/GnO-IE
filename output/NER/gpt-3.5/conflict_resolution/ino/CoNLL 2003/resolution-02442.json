Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Vail\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: Since \"Colorado\" is mentioned in the context of a date, it is less likely to be a location. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Colorado\" as not being a named entity.\n- Conflict 3: NER Response 3 does not provide any information, so we can ignore it.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: \n- Location: Vail\n\nNER Response 2: \n- Organization: VAIL"},
