However, there is a conflict with the word \"Pace\" which is a named entity (organization) mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing NER Response 2\nNER Response 2 correctly identifies \"Pace\" as an organization mentioned in the paragraph. There are no conflicts in this response.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing NER Response 3\nNER Response 3 correctly identifies \"Pace\" as a person mentioned in the paragraph. However, there is a conflict with the word \"Pace\" which is actually an organization in this context.\n\nResolution:\nBased on the analysis, the conflict in NER Response 1 can be resolved by including \"Pace\" as an organization.
