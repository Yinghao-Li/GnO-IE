Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering \"NZ\" as a location.\n\nConflict 2 Resolution: There is no conflict with the third NER response, as \"Peters\" is correctly identified as a person.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|   NZ     |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| NZ           |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| Peters |"},
