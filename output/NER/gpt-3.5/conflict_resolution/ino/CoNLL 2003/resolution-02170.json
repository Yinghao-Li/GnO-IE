Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Munich\" as a location.\n\nConflict 2: Although NER Response 3 does not identify any person, we can infer that there might be a person associated with Munich Re, which is mentioned in the paragraph. However, without further information, we cannot resolve this conflict with certainty."},
