This conflict arises because \"Moscow Newsroom\" is a specific entity within the broader location of \"Moscow\".\n\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity, while there is a named entity present in the paragraph (\"Moscow Newsroom\").\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1: To resolve this conflict, we can consider \"Moscow Newsroom\" as a specific organization located in \"Moscow\". Therefore, we can merge the two NER responses and consider \"Moscow Newsroom\" as an Organization within the Location of \"Moscow\".\n\n- Conflict 2: To resolve this conflict, we can update NER Response 3 to include \"Moscow Newsroom\" as an Organization.\n\nUpdated NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Moscow   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Moscow Newsroom    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------|\n| Moscow Newsroom |"},
