This conflict arises because \"Canberra Bureau\" is a specific entity within the broader entity of \"Canberra.\"\n\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 states that there is no Person entity mentioned in the paragraph. However, it is possible that there may be a person associated with the \"Canberra Bureau\" mentioned in NER Response 2.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1 resolution: Merge the NER results from Response 1 and Response 2 to identify \"Canberra Bureau\" as an Organization located in \"Canberra.\"\n\n- Conflict 2 resolution: Since there is no explicit mention of a person in the paragraph, we can assume that there is no Person entity associated with the \"Canberra Bureau\" mentioned in NER Response 2.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\n- Organization: Canberra Bureau\n- Location: Canberra\n- Person: None"},
