NER Response 1 identifies it as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to consider the context of the paragraph. Since the paragraph does not provide any additional information, we cannot definitively determine whether \"MILWAUKEE\" refers to a location or an organization. However, based on common knowledge, \"MILWAUKEE\" is commonly known as a city in Wisconsin, which suggests that it is more likely to be a location.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering \"MILWAUKEE\" as a location, as identified in NER Response 1."},
