Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering NER Response 1 as the correct identification for \"Germany\".\n\nStep 3: Check for any additional conflicts.\n\nThere are no conflicts in the identification of the named entity \"Hilde Gerg\". NER Response 3 correctly identifies \"Hilde Gerg\" as a person.\n\nOverall, the conflicts in the NER results have been resolved by considering NER Response 1 for \"Germany\" and NER Response 3 for \"Hilde Gerg\"."},
