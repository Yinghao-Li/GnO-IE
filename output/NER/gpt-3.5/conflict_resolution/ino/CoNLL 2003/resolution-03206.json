Review the context: Check the surrounding text or additional information to understand the nature of \"Hapoel Kfar Sava\" and determine whether it is a Location or an Organization.\n\n2. Consult external sources: Look up \"Hapoel Kfar Sava\" in reliable sources such as official websites, news articles, or databases to gather more information about its entity type.\n\n3. Clarify with the author: If possible, reach out to the author or the source of the text to seek clarification on the entity type of \"Hapoel Kfar Sava\".\n\nBy following these steps and considering the suggested solutions, the conflicts in the NER results can be resolved."},
