NER Response 1 identifies \"Pakistan\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we need to determine the correct named entity type for \"Pakistan\" in the given context. Since the paragraph is about a cricket match, it is more likely that \"Pakistan\" refers to the national cricket team, which is an organization, rather than a geographical location. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering NER Response 2 as the correct identification.\n\nResolved NER Results: \nNER Response 1: None\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n|   Pakistan   |\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
