Therefore, NER Response 1 is incorrect.\n- NER Response 2 correctly identifies \"Sunderland\" and \"Wimbledon\" as organizations, as they are both football clubs. However, it does not specify the type of organization. To improve the results, it would be better to classify them as sports organizations or football clubs.\n- NER Response 3 does not provide any relevant information.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Sunderland   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization        |\n|-------------------|\n| Sunderland (Club) |\n| Wimbledon (Club)  |\n\nNER Response 3: |                |\n|----------------|\n|                |"},
