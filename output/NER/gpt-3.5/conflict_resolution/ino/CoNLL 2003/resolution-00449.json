NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to consider the context of the paragraph. Since the paragraph does not provide any additional information, it is difficult to determine the correct identification of the named entity. However, based on common knowledge, \"DETROIT\" is commonly known as a city, which aligns with NER Response 1 identifying it as a location.
