Therefore, NER Response 3 is correct in identifying them as persons.\n\n- \"China\" and \"Indonesia\" are mentioned as the countries to which Gong Zhichao and Mia Audina belong. Therefore, NER Response 2 is correct in identifying them as organizations.\n\nSo, the resolved NER results would be:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|  China   |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| China        |\n| Indonesia    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person        |\n|---------------|\n| Gong Zhichao  |\n| Mia Audina    |"},
