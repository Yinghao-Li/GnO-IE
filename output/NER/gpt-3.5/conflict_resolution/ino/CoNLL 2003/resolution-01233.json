NER Response 1 identifies \"Africa\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to consider the context of the paragraph. In this case, the statement \"If Africa does not wish to lose its turn we have to act fast\" suggests that \"Africa\" is being referred to as a continent or a geographical region, rather than an organization.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve the conflicts by considering NER Response 1 as the correct identification, where \"Africa\" is identified as a location.\n\nStep 3: Final resolved NER results.\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|  Africa  |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| Diouf  |\n\nThe conflicts have been resolved, and the final NER results are \"Africa\" as a location and \"Diouf\" as a person."},
