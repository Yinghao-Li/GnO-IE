NER Response 1 identifies \"Berne Convention\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Berne Convention\" based on the context of the paragraph. \n\nIn this case, the phrase \"covered by the century-old Berne Convention\" suggests that the Berne Convention is a legal agreement or treaty, which is typically associated with organizations rather than locations. Therefore, NER Response 2, which identifies \"Berne Convention\" as an organization, is likely the correct entity type.\n\nStep 3: Update the NER results.\n\nBased on the resolution, we can update the NER results as follows:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|           |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Berne Convention |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
