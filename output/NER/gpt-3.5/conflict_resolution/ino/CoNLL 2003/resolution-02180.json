NER Response 1 identifies \"Frankfurt\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Frankfurt\" based on the context. In this paragraph, \"Frankfurt\" is mentioned in the context of a financial transaction involving the dollar and marks. It is more likely that \"Frankfurt\" refers to a location (Frankfurt, Germany) rather than an organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Frankfurt\" as a location. \n\nStep 3: Update the resolved NER results.\n\nResolved NER Response: | Location |\n|-----------------|\n| Frankfurt       |\n\nThe resolved NER response identifies \"Frankfurt\" as a location."},
