Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by accepting NER Response 2, which identifies \"Norilsk\" as an organization.\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 incorrectly identifies \"Russia\" as a person. In the given context, \"Russia\" refers to the country, not a person. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by identifying \"Russia\" as a location or a geopolitical entity.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n- Norilsk: Organization\n- Russia: Location or Geopolitical Entity"},
