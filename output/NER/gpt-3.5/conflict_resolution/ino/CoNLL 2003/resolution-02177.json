Therefore, NER Response 2 is correct in identifying \"Brussels Newsroom\" as an Organization.\n\nSince \"Brussels\" is mentioned separately in the paragraph, it is likely referring to the location itself. Therefore, NER Response 1 is correct in identifying \"Brussels\" as a Location.\n\nNER Response 3 does not provide any identification for \"Brussels\" and is not relevant in this case.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Brussels |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Brussels Newsroom |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
