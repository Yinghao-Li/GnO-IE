This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 2 identifies \"Cricket\" as an organization, but it is actually a sport. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\n- Conflict 3: NER Response 3 does not identify any named entities, but there is a named entity \"Sheffield Shield\" that should be recognized as an organization. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1: Based on the context, \"Sheffield Shield\" is a cricket tournament, not a location. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Sheffield Shield\" as an organization, consistent with NER Response 2.\n\n- Conflict 2: \"Cricket\" should be recognized as a sport, not an organization. This conflict can be resolved by removing \"Cricket\" from the organization category in NER Response 2.\n\n- Conflict 3: NER Response 3 does not identify any named entities, but it should recognize \"Sheffield Shield\" as an organization, consistent with NER Response 2. This conflict can be resolved by including \"Sheffield Shield\" in the organization category in NER Response 3.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Sheffield |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Sheffield Shield |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Sheffield Shield |"},
