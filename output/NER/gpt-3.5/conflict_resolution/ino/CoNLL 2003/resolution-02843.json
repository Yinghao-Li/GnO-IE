This is a conflict.\n\nIn NER Response 2, \"Hearts\" is identified as an organization, but there is no conflict with any other response.\n\nIn NER Response 3, there is no identified entity, so there is no conflict.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflict between NER Response 1 and NER Response 2, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Raith\". Without further context, it is difficult to determine whether \"Raith\" refers to a location or an organization. It could potentially be both, depending on the context. Therefore, we cannot definitively resolve this conflict without additional information.\n\nStep 3: Provide the resolved conflicts.\n\nThe conflict between NER Response 1 and NER Response 2 cannot be resolved without additional context."},
