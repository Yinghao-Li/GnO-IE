However, \"John Major\" is also identified as a person, which is correct, but conflicts with NER Response 2 where it is identified as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to correct the identification of the named entities.\n\n- In NER Response 2, \"Prime Minister John Major\" should be identified as a person, not an organization.\n- In NER Response 3, \"John Major\" should be identified as a person, not an organization.\n\nCorrected NER Response:\n\nNER Response 2: | Person                |\n|---------------------|\n| Prime Minister John Major |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person       |\n|--------------|\n| Clarke       |\n| John Major   |\n\nNow, the conflicts in the NER results have been resolved."},
