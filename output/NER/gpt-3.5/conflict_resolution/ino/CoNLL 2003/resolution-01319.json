Based on this context, it is more likely that \"Norilsk\" refers to a Location rather than an Organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering NER Response 1 as the correct identification.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Norilsk  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Tass         |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person    |\n|-----------|\n| Livshits  |"},
