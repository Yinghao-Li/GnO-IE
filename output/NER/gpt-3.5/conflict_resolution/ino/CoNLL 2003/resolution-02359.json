NER Response 1 identifies \"Singapore\" as a \"Location\" entity, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an \"Organization\" entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nBased on the context of the paragraph, it is clear that \"Singapore\" refers to a location rather than an organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Singapore\" as a \"Location\" entity.\n\nStep 3: Identify any additional named entities.\n\nNER Response 3 correctly identifies \"Supple\" as a \"Person\" entity.\n\nFinal resolved NER results:\n\n| Location |\n|----------|\n| Singapore |\n\n| Person |\n|---------|\n| Supple  |"},
