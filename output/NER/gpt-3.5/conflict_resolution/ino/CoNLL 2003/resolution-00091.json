Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Pakistan\" as an organization, as identified in NER Response 2.\n- Conflict 2: Since NER Response 3 does not identify any person, and the paragraph does not mention any specific person, we can assume that there is no conflict in this case.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Pakistan     |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Cricket      |\n| Pakistan     |\n| New Zealand  |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |\n\nPlease note that the resolution of conflicts is based on the context and assumptions made."},
