NER Response 1 identifies \"Tallinna\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies \"Tallinna Pank\" as an organization. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"Tallinna\". \n\nBased on the context provided in the paragraph, \"Tallinna\" is most likely referring to \"Tallinna Pank\", which is an organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by updating NER Response 1 to identify \"Tallinna\" as an organization instead of a location.\n\nUpdated NER Response 1: | Organization |\n|------------------|\n| Tallinna        |\n\nNow, the conflicts in the NER results have been resolved."},
