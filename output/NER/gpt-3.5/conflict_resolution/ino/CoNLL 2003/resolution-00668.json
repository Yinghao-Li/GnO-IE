Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering NER Response 1 as the correct identification.\n- Conflict 2: Without any additional information, it is difficult to determine the correct identification for \"Lens\". However, considering the context of the paragraph, it is more likely that \"Lens\" refers to a sports team or a city rather than a person. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering NER Response 2 as the correct identification.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\n- \"Nantes\" is identified as a location.\n- \"Lens\" is identified as an organization."},
