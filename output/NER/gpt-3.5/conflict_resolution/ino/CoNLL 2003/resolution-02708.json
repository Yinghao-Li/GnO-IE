This is a conflict as the same entity is identified differently.\n\nNER Response 3 does not identify any named entity, so there is no conflict with the other responses.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"World Grand Prix finals\" based on the context. \n\nIn this case, \"World Grand Prix finals\" is more likely to be an event or a competition rather than a location or an organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflicts by identifying \"World Grand Prix finals\" as an Event.\n\nResolved NER Response: | Event |\n|--------|\n| World Grand Prix finals |\n\nBy resolving the conflicts, we have identified \"World Grand Prix finals\" as an Event, which is a more appropriate entity type in this context."},
