This conflict arises because \"New York\" can refer to both a location and a part of the organization's name.\n\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not provide any entity type for the given text \"New York Commodities Desk\". This conflict arises because NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1 resolution: Based on the context, it is likely that \"New York Commodities Desk\" refers to the name of an organization rather than a location. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"New York Commodities Desk\" as an organization entity.\n\n- Conflict 2 resolution: NER Response 3 does not provide any entity type for \"New York Commodities Desk\". Since NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"New York Commodities Desk\" as an organization entity.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| New York |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| New York Commodities Desk |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------|\n| New York Commodities Desk |"},
