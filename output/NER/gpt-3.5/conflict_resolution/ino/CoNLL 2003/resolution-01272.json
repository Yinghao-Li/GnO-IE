NER Response 1 identifies it as a \"Location\", while NER Response 2 identifies it as an \"Organization\". This is a conflict in the entity type assigned to the same entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity type for \"CIS airports\" based on the context. In this case, \"CIS airports\" refers to a group of airports rather than a specific location or organization. Therefore, the correct entity type for \"CIS airports\" would be \"Organization\" as mentioned in NER Response 2.\n\nResolved conflicts:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| None     |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| CIS airports |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| None   |"},
