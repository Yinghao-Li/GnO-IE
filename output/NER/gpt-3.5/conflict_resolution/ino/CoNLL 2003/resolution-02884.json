Therefore, it should be identified as an organization, not a location. NER Response 1 is incorrect in identifying it as a location.\n\n- \"Leeds\" is mentioned in the paragraph as a team playing against \"Middlesbrough\". Therefore, it should also be identified as an organization. NER Response 2 correctly identifies \"Leeds\" as an organization.\n\n- NER Response 3 does not identify any named entities, which is incorrect.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Middlesbrough |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Middlesbrough |\n| Leeds        |\n\nNER Response 3: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Middlesbrough |\n| Leeds        |"},
