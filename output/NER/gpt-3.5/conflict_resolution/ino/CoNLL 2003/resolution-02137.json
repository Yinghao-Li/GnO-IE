NER Response 1 identifies \"Radiometer\" as a location, while NER Response 2 identifies it as an organization. This is a conflict that needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the NER results.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we need to determine the correct entity type for the named entity \"Radiometer\" based on the context provided in the paragraph. \n\nIn the given paragraph, \"Radiometer\" is mentioned as a medical equipment group. Based on this information, it is more likely that \"Radiometer\" refers to an organization rather than a location. Therefore, we can conclude that NER Response 2, which identifies \"Radiometer\" as an organization, is the correct resolution for the conflict.\n\nResolved NER Results: \nNER Response 1: None\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Radiometer   |\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
