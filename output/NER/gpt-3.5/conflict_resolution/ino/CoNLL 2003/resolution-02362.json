One is identified as a Location, and the other as an Organization. There is also a conflict in the absence of any identified Person entity.\n\nStep 2: Resolve Conflicts\nTo resolve the conflicts, we need to determine the correct entity types based on the context of the paragraph.\n\nIn this case, \"Singapore\" refers to a country, which is a Location. Therefore, the correct entity type for \"Singapore\" is Location.\n\nSince there is no specific person mentioned in the paragraph, the absence of a Person entity is correct.\n\nResolved NER Results:\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|-----------|\n| Singapore |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|--------------|\n| Singapore    |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
