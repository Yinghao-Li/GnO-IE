They provide valid named entities without any contradictions.\n\nHowever, NER Response 3 incorrectly identifies \"Witnesses\" and \"Students\" as Person entities. These are not specific names of individuals, but rather general terms referring to groups of people. Therefore, there is a conflict in NER Response 3.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we can remove \"Witnesses\" and \"Students\" from NER Response 3, as they are not specific named entities.\n\nUpdated NER Response 3:\n\n| Person |\n|--------|\n|        |\n\nNow, there are no conflicts in the named entity recognition results."},
