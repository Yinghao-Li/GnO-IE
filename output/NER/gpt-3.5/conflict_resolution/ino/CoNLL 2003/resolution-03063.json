Therefore, NER Response 1 is incorrect in identifying them as locations.\n\nHowever, it is not clear from the paragraph whether \"East\" refers to a location or an organization. Therefore, NER Response 2 cannot be fully resolved without further context.\n\nStep 3: Final resolved NER results.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, the resolved NER results would be:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Airdrieonians |\n| Clydebank    |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Airdrieonians |\n| Clydebank    |\n| East         |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n|        |"},
