Therefore, it would be more appropriate to classify it as a \"Group\" entity instead.\n\nResolved conflicts:\n\nNER Response 1: \n\n| Location       |\n|----------------|\n| city-state     |\n| 160 countries  |\n\nNER Response 2: \n\n| Organization |\n|--------------|\n| 160 countries |\n\nNER Response 3: \n\n| Person |\n|--------|\n| 4,000 officials |\n\nUpdated resolved conflicts:\n\nNER Response 1: \n\n| Location       |\n|----------------|\n| city-state     |\n| 160 countries  |\n\nNER Response 2: \n\n| Group |\n|-------|\n| 160 countries |\n\nNER Response 3: \n\n| Person |\n|--------|\n| 4,000 officials |"},
