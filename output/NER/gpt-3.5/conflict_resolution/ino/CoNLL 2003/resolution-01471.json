This conflict arises because \"Santiago\" can refer to both a location and an organization.\n\nConflict 2: There is no conflict in the identification of \"Roger Atwood\" as a person. \n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nConflict 1 Resolution: Based on the context provided in the paragraph, it is more likely that \"Santiago\" refers to a location rather than an organization. Therefore, we can resolve the conflict by considering \"Santiago\" as a location.\n\nConflict 2 Resolution: There is no conflict in the identification of \"Roger Atwood\" as a person, so no resolution is needed.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Santiago |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Santiago |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person        |\n|---------------|\n| Roger Atwood  |"},
