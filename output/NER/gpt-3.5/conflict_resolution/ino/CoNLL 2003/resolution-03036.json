However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the correct interpretation. It would be best to consult additional information or clarify the intended meaning.\n- Conflict 2: NER Response 3 does not provide any named entity for \"Doncaster\". It is possible that this is an error or oversight in the NER results. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine the correct named entity for \"Doncaster\" in this case.\n\nOverall, the conflicts in the NER results for \"Doncaster\" cannot be fully resolved without additional context or information."},
