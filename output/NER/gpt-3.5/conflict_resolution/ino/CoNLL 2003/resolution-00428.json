Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Philadelphia\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: \"Left end\" is not a named entity in this context. It refers to a direction or position on the football field. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by not considering \"Left end\" as a named entity.\n- Conflict 3: \"Troy Vincent\" is a person's name, not a location. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by considering \"Troy Vincent\" as a person.\n- Conflict 4: \"Faulk\" is not a named entity in this context. It refers to a player's last name. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by not considering \"Faulk\" as a named entity.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location    |\n|-------------|\n| Philadelphia|\n\nNER Response 2: | Person       |\n|--------------|\n| Troy Vincent |\n\nNote: \"Left end\" and \"Faulk\" are not considered as named entities in the resolved results."},
