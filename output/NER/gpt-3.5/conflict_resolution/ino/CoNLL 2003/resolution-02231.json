Therefore, we should resolve the conflict by considering \"NZ\" as a Location.\n\nConflict 2: \"NZ First\" is a Political Party, not just an Organization. Therefore, we should resolve the conflict by considering \"NZ First\" as a Political Party.\n\nStep 3: Revised NER results after conflict resolution.\n\nRevised NER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n| New Zealand       |\n\nRevised NER Response 2: | Political Party |\n|-----------------|\n| NZ First           |\n\nRevised NER Response 3: | Person  |\n|---------|\n| Bolger  |\n\nThe conflicts in the NER results have been resolved, and the revised NER results are provided."},
