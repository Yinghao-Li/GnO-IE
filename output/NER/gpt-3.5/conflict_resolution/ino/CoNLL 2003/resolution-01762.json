This conflict arises because \"St. Louis\" can refer to both a location and an organization.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\n- Conflict 1: Based on the context provided in the paragraph, it is more likely that \"St. Louis\" refers to the location rather than the organization. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"St. Louis\" as a location.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location   |\n|------------|\n| St. Louis  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization                |\n|-----------------------------|\n| St. Louis Merchants Exchange |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| None   |\n\nThe conflict has been resolved by accepting NER Response 1 for \"St. Louis\" as a location."},
