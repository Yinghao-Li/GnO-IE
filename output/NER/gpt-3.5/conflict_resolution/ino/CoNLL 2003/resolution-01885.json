They provide different types of entities (locations and organizations) and there is no overlap between them.\n\nHowever, there is a conflict between NER Response 2 and NER Response 3. NER Response 2 identifies \"Hindu nationalists\" as an organization, while NER Response 3 identifies it as a person. This conflict needs to be resolved.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) results.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, we need to determine whether \"Hindu nationalists\" should be classified as an organization or a person.
