Conflict 1: The entity \"DES MOINES\" is identified as a Location in NER Response 1, but as an Organization in NER Response 2. \n\nResolution: To resolve this conflict, we need more context or information about \"DES MOINES\" to determine whether it refers to a location or an organization. \n\n2. Conflict 2: NER Response 2 identifies \"DES MOINES 1996\" as an Organization, but there is no clear indication or context provided to determine if it is indeed an organization. \n\nResolution: Without further context, it is difficult to determine the correct entity type for \"DES MOINES 1996\". It could potentially be a date or some other type of entity. \n\n3. Conflict 3: NER Response 3 does not identify any named entity for the given text \"12-06\". \n\nResolution: Without further context, it is difficult to determine the correct entity type for \"12-06\". It could potentially be a date or some other type of entity. \n\nIn summary, the conflicts in the NER results are related to the entity types assigned to \"DES MOINES\" and \"DES MOINES 1996\", as well as the lack of identification for \"12-06\"."},
