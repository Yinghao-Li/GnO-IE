Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Indianapolis\" as a location.\n- Conflict 2: \"Philadelphia\" is a city, not an organization. Therefore, we can resolve this conflict by accepting NER Response 1 and considering \"Philadelphia\" as a location.\n- Conflict 3: Since NER Response 3 does not identify any named entities, we can ignore it and consider only NER Response 1 and NER Response 2.\n\nResolved NER Results:\n\n- \"Indianapolis\" is identified as a location.\n- \"Philadelphia\" is identified as a location."},
