The NER Response 3 should be adjusted to remove \"Indonesian ambassador to Norway\" as a person.\n\nUpdated NER Results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Location |\n|----------|\n|  Norway  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|-----------------|\n| Indonesian ambassador |\n\nNER Response 3: | Person |\n|--------|\n| Alatas |"},
