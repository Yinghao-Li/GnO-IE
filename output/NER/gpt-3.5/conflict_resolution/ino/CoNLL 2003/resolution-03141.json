Conflict 1: The entity \"Zimbabwe\" is identified as both a location and an organization.\n   Resolution: Determine the correct entity type based on the context. If the paragraph is referring to the country, \"Zimbabwe\" should be labeled as a location. If it is referring to an event or tournament, \"Zimbabwe Open\" should be labeled as an organization.\n\n2. Conflict 2: The entity \"Zimbabwe Open\" is identified as an organization, but it is also mentioned in the paragraph as an event.\n   Resolution: Update the entity type of \"Zimbabwe Open\" to reflect that it is an event rather than just an organization.\n\n3. Conflict 3: No entity type is assigned to any person mentioned in the paragraph.\n   Resolution: Identify and label any relevant person entities mentioned in the paragraph. If there are no person entities mentioned, the NER response is correct.\n\nBy resolving these conflicts, the NER results will be more accurate and consistent."},
