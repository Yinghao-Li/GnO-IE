This conflict arises because \"Manchester United\" is a football club, which is an organization, and not a location.\n\nConflict 2: The NER Response 3 identifies \"Manchester United fans\" as a person, but it should be identified as a group or a collective noun.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the conflicts.\n\nConflict 1 resolution: \"Manchester United\" should be identified as an organization, not a location. Therefore, the NER Response 2 is correct, and the NER Response 1 is incorrect.\n\nConflict 2 resolution: \"Manchester United fans\" should be identified as a group or a collective noun, not as individual persons. Therefore, the NER Response 3 is incorrect.\n\nResolved NER results:\n\nNER Response 1: | Organization       |\n|--------------------|\n| Manchester United  |\n\nNER Response 2: | Location |\n|----------|\n| Austria  |\n\nNER Response 3: | Group/Collective Noun |\n|--------|\n| Manchester United fans |"},
