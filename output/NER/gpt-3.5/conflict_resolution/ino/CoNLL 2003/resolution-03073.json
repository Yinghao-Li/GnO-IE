Therefore, the correct identification would be:\n\n- \"Elgin City\" should be identified as an Organization.\n- \"Whitehill\" should also be identified as an Organization.\n\nResolved NER Response: \nNER Response 2: | Organization |\n|--------------|\n| Elgin City   |\n| Whitehill    |\n\nNER Response 1 and NER Response 3 are not accurate based on the given paragraph."},
