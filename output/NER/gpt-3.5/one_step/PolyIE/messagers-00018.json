In the TGA measurement , the decomposition temperatures (T d) at which a 5 % weight loss occurred were as high as 339 and 337 ° C for POBDTPD and PEBDTPD , respectively (Figure S2c , d) . 3.3 . Optical Properties and Electronic Structures . The UV - vis absorption spectra of POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers in a chlorobenzene solution or in a thin film state are shown in Figure 1a . The absorption peaks and optical band gaps are summarized in Table 1 . POBDTPD and PEBDTPD in solution showed similar characteristics , covering a wide range absorption band of 300 - 900 nm . A strong absorption was observed at short wavelengths with a maximum peak at ∼ 490 nm ; a broad absorption peak was observed over the longer wavelength range of 550 - 900 nm . The lower absorption of POBDTPD in 550 - 900 nm is presumably related with the higher fraction of lower molecular weighted POBDTPD polymer chains compared to the PEBDTPD . 46 POBDTPD and PEBDTPD films also showed similar absorption bandwidth and shape . However , there was a pronounced difference that the PEBDTPD film showed a higher extinction coefficient (4.1 × 10 ^ 4 cm^-1 at the peak of 675 nm) than the POBDTPD (2.6 × 10 ^ 4 cm^-1 at the peak of 673 nm) , reflecting that the polymer chain packing in PEBDTPD film is better than that in POBDTPD . Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out to determine the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers . The cyclic voltammograms of the polymers and energy level diagram for the materials used in the study are shown in Figures 2 and 1b , respectively . The oxidation and reduction potentials and the electrochemical band gaps (E g EC) of the polymers are summarized in Table 1 . The HOMO levels of the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers were -5.23 and -5.37 eV , respectively . Interestingly , the branched alkyl chains of 2ethylhexyloxy groups stabilized the HOMO level slightly more than the linear alkyl chains of octyloxy groups , which is in line with previous reports . 47 - 50 The LUMO levels of POBDTPD and PEBDTPD were -4.00 and -4.06 eV , respectively . This less dependence of the polymer LUMO level on substituted alkyl chains is again consistent with the previous report . 47 This different dependence of the HOMO or LUMO levels on the substituted alkyl chains might be originated from the fact that the alkoxy chains affect the position of the HOMO level than the LUMO level since they participate to some degree in the construction of HOMO but does little in the formation of LUMO according to our DFT calculation (Figure 3) . It should be noted that the LUMO levels are on the borderline for fast electron transfer to PC 70 BM whose LUMO level is -4.3 eV. 51 This result indicated that the DTPD acted as a very strong electron - withdrawing unit in donor - acceptor - type low band gap polymers , as predicted in the DFT calculation .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
