V eff = V 0 - V , where V 0 is the voltage at which J L = J D and V is the applied voltage . When the reverse voltage is greater than 2 V , recombination will be suppressed because of a high internal electric field and thus the current density becomes saturated (J sat) . Consequently , P(E , T) = J ph / J sat could be used to describe the charge dissociation probability . The charge dissociation probability of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based cells was estimated to be 0.86 , 0.94 , 0.98 , and 0.92 , respectively .

Figure 7 demonstrates the dependence of V oc and J sc against light intensity , which could be used to describe the recombination process in BHJ films .

Bimolecular recombination was also investigated by measuring the dependence of J sc against light intensity , in which the exponential factor α in the power law of J sc ∝ P light α is used Article to indicate bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film . The closer the estimated α to 1.0 , the weaker the bimolecular recombination occurs in the device . 43 Obviously , with α = 0.98 , the PffBB-14 - based device would exhibit the least occurrence of bimolecular recombination in the active layer . In contrast , the PffBB-10 - based device showed an α value of 0.86 , indicating that the bimolecular recombination loss was severe in its BHJ film .
