Consistent with the observed homogeneous donor : acceptor network with the smallest rms roughness , the PffBB-14 - based device exhibited the highest J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 and FF of 64.36 % , suggesting efficient charge dissociation and transport . In short , AFM results confirm that the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend layer exhibited a desirable morphology for efficient photovoltaic properties . Our results also indicated that the extremely strong aggregation strength of the donor polymer would hinder for the formation of a desirable homogeneous donor / acceptor interpenetration network for efficient photovoltaic performance .

PffBB - n exhibited intriguing strong and controllable aggrega - tion behavior , which can be modulated by the size of the alkyl side chain attached on the polymer backbone , processing temperature and solvent used . Because of the strong aggregation behavior , the absorption cut - off of the polymer thin films could extend to ∼ 780 nm , giving rise to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Taking advantage of the temperature - dependent aggregation effect , BHJ PSCs with PffBB - n : PC71BM as an active blend layer spin - coated at different temperatures were fabricated and investigated which showed considerably various photovoltaic performance .
