Compared to homopolymer P6 , all copolymers P1 - P5 exhibit red - shifted absorptions and smaller optical bandgaps in solution and in film . Broad absorption bands located in the visible region were observed for the solution and film of P1 (Figure 4) . The absorbance maximum for P1 in solution is 496 nm . The absorption spectrum of P1 in film exhibits red - shift and distinct shoulder peak at ca . 540 nm , which are probably related to the formation of molecular aggregates owing to the strong interchain interactions . The absorption maxima of P2 in solution and in film are red - shifted 14 and 32 nm relative to that of P1 , respectively , thanks to its more planar conformation and increased conjugation . P3 and P4 exhibit almost same absorption profile in solution and in film . Compared to P1 and P2 , P3 and P4 exhibit relatively narrow and blue - shifted absorption band in solution and in film . P5 in solution and in film exhibits absorbance maxima at 503 and 524 nm , which are shifted 20 nm to the red relative to those of P4 , suggesting a more planar conformation .
