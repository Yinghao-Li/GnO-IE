The best devices of PDTP - BT and PDTP - DTBT show PCE of 1.64 % and 2.37 % , respectively .

The V OC values of the devices are around 0.5 V , suggesting that the addition of the thienyl units does not affect the main chain distortion . This coincides well with similar HOMO energy levels for the copolymers measured by CV . These results indicate that the PCEs of the photovoltaic devices based on PDTP - DT2BT : PC 70 BM were higher than those of PDTP - DTBT : PC 70 BM and PDTP - BT : PC 70 BM .

The shapes of the EQE curves of the devices in the range of 450 - 700 nm could be assigned to the stronger absorption of PC 70 BM . In conclusion , three low band gap D - A copolymers , based on the DTP donor and the BT acceptor , with different numbers of thienyl spacers along the backbone have been designed and synthesized . The thienyl spacer makes the absorption spectra peak blue - shift in the longer wavelength range and red - shift in the low wavelength range .
