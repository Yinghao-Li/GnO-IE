Time dependent DFT calculations show that the absorption band in the longer wavelength is mainly attributed to the transition from HOMO delocalized in the D - A backbone to LUMO localized in DTP units for all the polymers . On the other hand , the absorption in the shorter wavelength is largely contributed by the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1 , which is similar to π - π * transition in polythiophene judging by the shape of the orbitals . Therefore , the introduction of more thienyl spacer could stabilize LUMO+1 (π *) due to the better conjugation , resulting in the red - shift of the absorption band . At the same time , it could decrease the D - A nature of the polymer due to the weaker electron acceptability of DTP , resulting in the blueshift of the charge transfer bands . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the polymers and estimate the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers . Representative cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of these copolymers are shown in Fig . 2 Crystalline order of the copolymer thin films was investigated by X - ray diffraction (XRD) scans (Fig .
