The blends of PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO with PC71BM at different weight ratios were used to optimize the device performances , and their J - V curves are shown in Figure 5 . The PSCs based on PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than that based on PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM . With a weight ratio of PzNDTDTBO to PC71BM 1.5 : 1 , a PCE of 4.37 % with V oc of 0.76 V , J sc of 10.35 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 55.5 % was achieved while the devices based on PzNDTDTBT showed a relatively low PCE of 2.43 % , with V oc of 0.62 V , J sc of 8.21 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 47.7 % at the optimal PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ratio of 1 : 2 (w / w) . The increased value of V oc of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs is in accordance with the decreased value of the HOMO energy level of the polymer and the higher J sc and FF could be attributed to the higher hole mobility (4.4 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1) . By addition of 1 % 1,8 - diiodooctane (DIO) into o - DCB used for spin - coating , the PCEs of the solar cells based on PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO were improved to 3.22 and 4.63 % , respectively , mostly through an increase in the FF . 25 To further improve the photovoltaic performances of the PSC devices , thermal annealing was employed . , the FF of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs increased from 62.5 to 65.5 % , and consequently , the PCE increased from 4.63 to 5.07 % . However , for PzNDTDTBT , the measured PCE was not improved by thermal annealing but , inversely , exhibited a slight decrease of photovoltaic values . Compared with PzNDTDTBT / PzNDTDTBO , PSCs based on PzNDTTPD shows higher V oc , which corresponds to the deepest HOMO energy level of PzNDTTPD (see Table 2) . . . Figure 7 shows the AFM images of the active layer surfaces . Without additive or thermal annealing , both the blend films based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO demonstrate smooth morphology with low average surface roughness (R a) of 0.27 and 1.23 nm , respectively . After adding DIO , a nanoscaled fine interpenetrating network and smaller domain size of phase separation are formed , which is beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport . R a is raised from 0.27 to 1.91 nm for PzNDTDTBT and from 1.23 to 1.88 nm for PzNDTDTBO , which can explain the increase of FF of the photovoltaic devices to some degree . When the PzNDTDTBO blend film was then thermally annealed at 150 ° C for 10 min , R a is further increased .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
