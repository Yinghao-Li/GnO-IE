Conjugated polymers can be classified as hole (p - type) or electron (n - type) transporting materials according to the type of orderly transferring charge carriers . Most of conjugated polymers are p - type semiconductors that have seen a dramatic rise in performance over the past decade while much less attention has been devoted to n - type semiconducting polymers that have lagged behind their p - type counterparts . 2 Organic n - type materials are essential for the fabrication of organic p - n junctions , OPVs , n - channel OFETs , OLEDs , and complementary logic circuits . 3 The n - type building blocks are the core components in n - type semiconducting polymers . Aromatic imides such as rylene diimides are one of the classical n - type building blocks and can exhibit relatively high electron affinities , high electron mobilities , and excellent chemical , thermal , and photochemical stabilities . 4 These materials are electron deficient due to the substitution of an aromatic core with one or two sets of π - accepting imide groups that are mutually conjugated .
