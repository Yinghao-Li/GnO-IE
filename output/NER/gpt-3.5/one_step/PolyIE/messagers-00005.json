Density functional theory (DFT) calculations was carried out to probe the molecular and electronic properties of the PffBB - n polymer by means of B3LYP / 6 - 311+(d , p) as a basis set in a vacuum using the repeating conjugated units of the polymer backbone in which all of the alkyl substitutions were replaced by ethyl groups to reduce the calculation time . Figure 2 displays the optimized molecular conformation and the frontier molecular orbitals of the ethyl - substituted repeating units of PffBB - n. The dihedral angle between the BDT electron - donating unit and the electron - deficient unit was found to be ∼ 26.9 ° in the optimized structure , which is caused by the ethyl substitution on the thienyl ring . The HOMO delocalizes extensively over the π - conjugation framework , whereas the LUMO mainly populated on the benzothiadiazole Article unit . Such frontier molecular orbital electron distribution would greatly enhance efficient intramolecular charge transfer . The electrochemical properties of PffBB - n were determined by cyclic voltammetry . Their results are summarized in Table 2 , and the respective energy levels are delineated in Figure 2d . The HOMO energy levels of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 were estimated from the onset oxidation potential to be -5.66 , -5.73 , -5.72 , and -5.78 eV , respectively . The corresponding LUMO energy levels were calculated from the HOMO energy level and the onset absorption of polymers in thin films , which were -4.01 , -4.11 , -4.11 , and -4.16 eV , respectively . As a result , the HOMO energy levels of PffBB - n polymers are much lower than that of ITO and their corresponding LUMO energy levels of PffBB - n lied slightly above that of PC71BM . Such energy level alignment would facilitate charge transfer from the donor polymer to the PC71BM acceptor and provide a relatively large difference between the HOMO energy level of donor polymers and the LUMO level of PC71BM , which is important to achieve a large V oc of a solar device . As a result , BHJ PSCs fabricated from these polymers are promising to achieve high device performance . X - Ray Diffraction (XRD) . X - ray diffraction measurements were carried out to determine the crystallinity of PffBB - n polymers and the XRD spectra are shown in Figure 3 . Despite various sizes of alkyl side chains attached , polymers with the same backbone show very similar XRD patterns .
