's estimation . 52 3.4 . Photovoltaic Performance Measurements . Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using polymer : PC 70 BM blend films . The polymer : PC 70 BM blends were dissolved in a mixed solvent containing chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8 - diiodooctane (DIO) in a volume ratio of 97 : 3 . The solutions were spincoated onto PEDOT : PSS - coated ITO substrates . A thin TiO 2 nanoparticle layer was then spin - coated onto the blend film , followed by aluminum evaporation . Devices prepared using either polymer showed the best performances for a polymer : PC 70 BM blend ratio of 1 : 2 . The solar cell properties were measured under AM1.5 G illumination , and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2 . The current density - voltage curves are shown in Figure 4a . POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices displayed reasonable open - circuit voltages (V oc) of 0.70 and 0.72 V , respectively , considering their HOMO levels , -5.23 and -5.37 eV , respectively . The POBDTPD device exhibited a short - circuit current (J sc) of 10.6 mA cm^-2 , whereas the PEBDTPD device showed a J sc of 13.5 mA cm^-2 . The fill factor (FF) values were 0.64 and 0.54 for the POBDTPD and the PEBDTPD devices , respectively . As a result , the PCEs were 4.7 % and 5.3 % for the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices , respectively . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were also measured (Figure 4b) . A high EQE response of greater than 50 % over the range 400- 550 nm was observed for both polymer devices . The EQEs were higher for the PEBDTPD device in the 550 - 900 nm range , partly because the PEBDTPD polymer has a higher light absorption at long wavelengths (Figure 1a) , which is consistent with the higher J sc values in the PEBDTPD device . To understand the reasons of the higher J sc and the lower FF in the PEBDTPD device , as compared with the POBDTPD device more specifically , we investigated film morphology , exciton separation , and carrier mobility in the polymer films and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films . First , film morphology was Figure 6 shows the PL spectra of the polymers and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films spin - coated from CB solutions or CB solutions containing 3 vol % DIO additives . Both the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers displayed PL with a peak around 990 nm . Blending polymers with PC 70 BMs , especially with an aid of the DIO additive , significantly quenched PL . This effective PL quenching suggested that the exciton separation was highly efficient in both the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
