We can conclude that the formation of crystalline nanoscale domains would be slightly induced in PCDSeBT : PC71BM with a thermal treatment in consequence of the ordered crystalline nature of the PCDSeBT on annealing as supported by the XRD results above as well as the large quinoidal character in the polymer backbone as the inclusion of selenophene . 23 The AFM of the annealed film gives an evidence for slightly nanofibril - like organization (see Figure 5b) . The hole and electron mobilities of PCDSeBT : PC71BM (1 : 4 w / w) blends were measured using the space - charge - limited current (SCLC) method and the J - V characteristics were plotted in Figure 6 . The hole mobility (μ hole = 4.68 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 / V ° s) obtained with the thermally annealed film is one order higher than that without post annealing (μ hole = 4.02 × 10 ^ -6 cm^2 / V ° s) , whereas in the both cases , the electron mobilities (μ electron) are similar (1.24 × 10 ^ -3 and 5.58 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 / V ° s) for as - cast and annealed films , respectively , yielding a smaller difference between the mobility ratio for the annealed film .
