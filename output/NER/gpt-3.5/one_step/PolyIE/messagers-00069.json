Herein , the EQE curves of the devices with the optimal performance are shown in Figure 8 . The devices showed a relatively high photoconversion efficiency over the whole wavelength range of 300 - 700 nm , with monochromatic EQE values around 50 - 60 % . Compared to the absorption spectra of pristine polymers , the significantly broadened EQE responses in the visible region can be attributed to both the intrinsic absorptions of the polymers and PC71BM . Also , it can be noted that devices based on PzNDTDTBO show stronger Field - Effect Transistor Properties . The performances of polymer field - effect transistors based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO were investigated using a bottom - gate , bottomcontact configuration . . (Figure 9) . All devices with L = 5 μm showed the highest hole mobility at different annealing temperatures . The devices showed a typical p - type transporting characteristic measured under ambient conditions . As shown in Table 4 , for both polymers the annealing temperature tends to affect the hole mobility . All devices based on both polymers were annealed at 60 , 100 , 140 , 180 , 220 , and 260 ° C , and both polymers showed thermal stability on each device . Figure 10 shows the output curves and transfer characteristics of the OFETs based on the polymers at 25 ° C and optimal annealing temperature . (Other OFETs data at different annealing temperatures are shown in Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2 .) After thermal annealing , the hole mobilities of both copolymers are increased , which implies that the crystallinity of the polymer films and ordered lamellar structure of π - π closepacking for polymer main chain are significantly improved at higher temperatures . High current modulation is observed with on / off current ratio of 10 ^ 6 -10 ^ 7 for PzNDTBTBO while PzNDTDTBT shows relatively lower on / off ratio of 10 ^ 3 -10 ^ 4 . The resulting optimal P - channel transistors demonstrate high hole mobilities of 0.43 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and 0.34 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTBTBO . Both the hole mobilities are among the highest values for BT - or BO - based polymers . In order to deeply study the variation of the performances of OFETs of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO after annealing , the thin - film microstructures and topographies were investigated by X - ray diffraction (XRD) and AFM . Figure 11 shows XRD patterns of the polymer thin films deposited on OTSmodified Si / SiO 2 substrates . For both polymers , obvious diffraction peaks were detected before the samples were annealed , which indicates that some degree of crystallinity has been formed at room temperature . PzNDTDTBT showed a sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = 21.4 ° and two weak peaks at 23.8 ° and 26.6 ° for the as - prepared thin film .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
