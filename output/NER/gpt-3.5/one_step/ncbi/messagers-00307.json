Let's break down the paragraph and identify the disease entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"exon-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/single-strand conformation polymorphism\": This is a technique used for genetic screening and does not refer to a specific disease.\n\n2. \"compound heterozygote\": This term refers to a genetic condition where an individual has two different mutations in the same gene. It is not a specific disease but rather a genetic state.\n\n3. \"C6 gene mutations\": This refers to mutations in the C6 gene. Without further context, it is not clear which specific disease these mutations are associated with.\n\nBased on the paragraph, there are no specific disease entities mentioned."},
