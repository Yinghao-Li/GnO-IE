Let's break down the paragraph and identify the disease entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"affected individuals\" - This phrase does not directly mention a specific disease, but it implies that there is a disease affecting these individuals.\n\n2. \"novel nonsense mutation\" - This phrase refers to a type of genetic mutation that can be associated with various diseases.\n\n3. \"exon 3 of the gene\" - This phrase refers to a specific location within a gene, which may be associated with a disease if there is a mutation present.\n\n4. \"NPII\" - This is a gene mentioned in the paragraph. It is not explicitly stated whether mutations in this gene are associated with a disease, but it is possible.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can summarize the disease entities mentioned as follows:\n\n| Disease |\n|---------|\n| Unknown (affecting affected individuals) |\n| Unknown (associated with novel nonsense mutation) |\n| Unknown (possibly associated with mutations in NPII gene) |\n\nPlease note that without further context or information, it is not possible to determine the specific diseases associated with these entities."},
