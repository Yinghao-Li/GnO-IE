Let's break down the paragraph and identify the disease entities mentioned:\n\n1. hypohaptoglobinemic - This term refers to a condition characterized by low levels of haptoglobin in the blood.\n\n2. Hp2 - This term refers to a specific genotype or variant of haptoglobin.\n\n3. Hpdel - This term refers to a deletion or deletion variant of haptoglobin.\n\n4. Hp1 - This term refers to another genotype or variant of haptoglobin.\n\nBased on the information provided, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are \"hypohaptoglobinemic\" and \"anomalous inheritance of Hp phenotypes.\"\n\nHere is the information presented as a Markdown table:\n\n| Disease                           |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| hypohaptoglobinemic               |\n| anomalous inheritance of Hp phenotypes |"},
