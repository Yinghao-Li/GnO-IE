Maternal disomy: This is not a specific disease entity, but rather a genetic condition where both copies of a chromosome are inherited from the mother, instead of one from each parent.\n\n2. GABRB3: This is not a disease, but rather a gene that codes for the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor beta3 subunit. Variations or mutations in this gene can be associated with certain neurological disorders.\n\nBased on the paragraph, there are no specific disease entities mentioned. However, there is a mention of a genetic condition (maternal disomy) and a gene (GABRB3) that can be associated with certain disorders."},
