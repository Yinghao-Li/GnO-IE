It refers to a laboratory technique used to study DNA methylation patterns.\n\n2. Exon alpha: This is not a disease entity. It refers to a specific region of the SNRPN gene.\n\n3. Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated polypeptide N (SNRPN) gene: This is not a disease entity. It refers to a specific gene involved in the regulation of gene expression.\n\n4. Chromosome 15: This is not a disease entity. It refers to a specific chromosome in the human genome.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no specific disease entities mentioned."},
