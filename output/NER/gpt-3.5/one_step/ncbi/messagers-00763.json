The paragraph primarily discusses a genetic analysis technique (polymerase chain reaction - single strand conformational polymorphism) and a genetic mutation (C to T substitution in exon 1 of the CPO gene). The mention of the putative presequence for targeting to mitochondria does not directly refer to a disease either.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."}
