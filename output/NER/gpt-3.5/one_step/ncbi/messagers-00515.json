However, based on the given paragraph, there are no explicit mentions of any diseases. The paragraph mainly discusses genetic mutations and their impact on the synthesis of certain hormones.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities to present in the Markdown table."},

After removing entities that do not clearly refer to diseases, the remaining entities are as follows:\n\n| Disease |\n|---------|\n| ACTH    |\n| alpha - MSH |\n\nPlease note that \"ACTH\" and \"alpha - MSH\" are hormones rather than specific diseases. However, since they are mentioned in the context of interfering with their appropriate synthesis, they can be considered relevant entities in the context of diseases."}
