The paragraph primarily discusses the use of a technique called reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate - diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry to visualize NOS (nitric oxide synthase) as an index of enzyme expression in mice brain regions related to motor control. Therefore, there are no disease entities to present in the Markdown table."}
