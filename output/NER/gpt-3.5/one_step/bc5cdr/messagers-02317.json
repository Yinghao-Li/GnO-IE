Polyspecific anti-human globulin - This is a reagent used in the Coombs' test to detect antibodies.\n4. Monospecific IgG reagents - This is another reagent used in the Coombs' test to detect specific types of antibodies.\n5. Warm reacting autoantibody - This refers to an autoantibody that reacts at body temperature and can cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\n\nBased on the paragraph, the disease entities mentioned are:\n\n1.
