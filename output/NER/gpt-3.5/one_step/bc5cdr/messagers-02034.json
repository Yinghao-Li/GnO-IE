It refers to a condition where there is a hole or rupture in the ileum, which is a part of the small intestine.\n\n2. \"ileostomy\" - This is not a disease entity but a surgical procedure. However, it is related to the previous disease entity as it was performed as a result of the ileal perforation. An ileostomy is a surgical procedure where the small intestine is brought to the surface of the abdomen to create an opening called a stoma, through which waste can exit the body.\n\nBased on the analysis, we have identified one disease entity: \"ileal perforation\".\n\nHere is the information presented as a Markdown table:\n\n| Disease            |\n|--------------------|\n| ileal perforation  |"},
