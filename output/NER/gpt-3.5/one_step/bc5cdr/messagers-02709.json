STZ: This is not a disease entity, but rather an abbreviation for Streptozotocin, which is a chemical compound commonly used to induce diabetes in animal models.\n\n2. ROS: This stands for Reactive Oxygen Species, which are highly reactive molecules that can cause damage to cells and tissues. While not a specific disease, an excessive production of ROS is often associated with various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.\n\n3. Excitotoxicity: This refers to the pathological process in which excessive stimulation of neurons leads to their damage or death. It is commonly associated with neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nBased on the paragraph, the identified disease entities are ROS and excitotoxicity. Here is the information presented as a Markdown table:\n\n| Disease        |\n|----------------|\n| ROS            |\n| Excitotoxicity |"},
