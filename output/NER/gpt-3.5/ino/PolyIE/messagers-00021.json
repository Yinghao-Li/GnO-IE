The less balanced carrier transport in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film accounts for the lower FF . The polymers and polymer blend films were also analyzed by X - ray diffraction (XRD) studies .

The crystalline features corresponding to π - stacking among the conjugated polymer backbones were also observed among TT - based polymers ; 25 however , the peaks were broader , and no crystalline peaks were observed at smaller angles around 4.4 ° . This less crystalline feature was possibly caused by the more twisted polymer backbones , as compared to PTB7 or PBDTTPD polymer backbones .
