The fill factor (FF) values were 0.64 and 0.54 for the POBDTPD and the PEBDTPD devices , respectively . As a result , the PCEs were 4.7 % and 5.3 % for the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices , respectively . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were also measured (Figure 4b) . A high EQE response of greater than 50 % over the range 400- 550 nm was observed for both polymer devices . The EQEs were higher for the PEBDTPD device in the 550 - 900 nm range , partly because the PEBDTPD polymer has a higher light absorption at long wavelengths (Figure 1a) , which is consistent with the higher J sc values in the PEBDTPD device . To understand the reasons of the higher J sc and the lower FF in the PEBDTPD device , as compared with the POBDTPD device more specifically , we investigated film morphology , exciton separation , and carrier mobility in the polymer films and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films .
