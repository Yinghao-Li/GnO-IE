In solution , the first two absorption peaks blue - shift to 380 - 420 and 520 - 560 nm , respectively , and the third absorption is highly temperature - dependent which becomes a shoulder peak at high temperature . Therefore , the absorption band located in the high energy region was attributed to π - π * transitions , whereas the broad absorption at around 560 nm corresponded to the intramolecular charge transfer band and the long - wavelength absorption emerged at ∼ 680 nm was due to the polymer interchain stacking aggregation . This aggregation - induced absorption is temperature - sensitive in which the absorption decreases with the increase of temperature , resulting from polymer chain segregation at high temperature . The incorporation of an alkyl side chain can often render a better solubility of a polymer ; however , the long alkyl side chain can exert stronger alkyl - alkyl chain interactions that can give rise to a strong aggregation of polymer chains . As shown in Figure 1 , the aggregation ability / strength of PffBB - n polymers also enhanced with an increase in the size of the alkyl side chains (from n = 10 to 16) .
