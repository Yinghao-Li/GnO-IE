However , good acceptor moieties enabling polymers to absorb wavelengths over 800 nm remain still rare though acceptor moieties strongly affected to produce a narrow band gap . 37 - 40 In search of new acceptor moieties , we designed an interesting structure of N - octyl-2,7 - dithia-5 - azacyclopenta[a]-pentalene-4,6 - dione (DTPD) . The DTPD is a structural combination of thieno [3,4 - b]thiophene and N - alkylpyrrole-2,5 - dione . The thieno [3,4 - b]thiophene is a particularly suitable structure to promote quinoid structures in conjugated polymers . 41 - 44 However , simple incorporation of the thieno- [3,4 - b]thiophene units might increase the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of polymers , which causes a significant loss of open - circuit voltages in PSCs . 42 Thus , it is desirable to attach electron - withdrawing groups such as ketone or ester groups and fluorine atoms . 12,15,30 Here we glued the Nalkylpyrrole-2,5 - dione , a strong electron - withdrawing unit , 45 to the thieno [3,4 - b]thiophene to bring down the HOMO level . Our DFT calculations , indeed , suggested that the DTPD would be a strong electron - withdrawing acceptor moiety (Figure S1) . 26,45 Therefore , each fractional unit in the DTPD may exert a synergetic effect to permit strong donor - acceptor electronic delocalization by the quinoid structure and to locate HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of resulting low band gap polymers in a deep state when the DTPD is copolymerized with an appropriate donor moiety . Despite these promising features , to the best of our knowledge , the DTPD moiety has never been utilized to synthesize low band gap polymers for PSCs .
