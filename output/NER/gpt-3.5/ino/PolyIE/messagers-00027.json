The current - density - voltage (J - V) characteristics of the devices under the illumination of simulated AM 1.5 G conditions (100 mW / cm^2) are shown in Figure 4a and the parameters are summarized in Table 2 . Without extensive optimization , the initial device fabricated from the blend solutions with a PCDSeBT : PC71BM weight ratio of 1 : 1 shows a PCE of 0.73 % with a J SC of 2.98 mA / cm^2 , a V OC of 0.71 V , a fill factor (FF) of 35 % .
