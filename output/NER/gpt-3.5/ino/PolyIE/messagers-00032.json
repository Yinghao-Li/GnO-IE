Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the redox behavior of the polymers and to determine their HOMO and LUMO energy levels . 25 CV was performed under an Ar atmosphere in a solution of TBABF 4 (0.10 M) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV / s and room temperature .
