In the past few years , spirobifluorene has been used as an ideal building block in construction of stable blue light - emitting materials . 11 In the spiro - annulated molecules , the two perpendicular conjugated moieties are connected with the sp 3 -hybridized carbon atom as the spiro center . This structural feature can minimize the extravagant aggregation of polymers containing spiro - annulated molecules and thus can improve their solubility and processability . 11,12 Furthermore , the spirobifluorene structure can prevent the possible photo / thermal oxidation of the 9 - position of the fluorene unit to form the undesired low energy ketonic defect . 13 In theory , stable polymer structures are beneficial for the long lifetime of polymer solar cells . Here , we demonstrate for the first time that spirobifluorene can be a very useful building block to construct main chain donor - acceptor alternating conjugated polymer , poly[2,7-(3′,6′-dioctyloxy)-9,9′-spirobifluorene - alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2 - thienyl-5′,6′-dioctyloxy-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) ] (PSFDTBT) as shown in Scheme 1 , for high efficiency polymer solar cells . The octyloxy chains on spirobifluorene and 2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole units can provide PSFDTBT with good solubility in common organic solvents . The transport properties of the polymer are investigated by fabricating organic thin film field - effect transistors (OFETs) . The pristine PSFDTBT film spin - cast from DCB solution exhibited hole mobility of 7.26 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10 ^ 5 . The PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films show hole mobility of 1.14 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and an electron mobility of 2.7 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Under simulated solar illumination of AM 1.5 G (100 mW / cm^2) , a PCE of 4.6 % has been achieved for PSCs composed of PSFDTBT and PC71BM as the active layer in simply processed devices . The devices illustrate a considerably high V oc of 0.94 V , a J sc of 8.0 mA / cm^2 , and a comparable fill factor (FF) of 0.60 . All device measurements were conducted in air without any encapsulation .
