Also , integration of thiophene with acene rings into a rigid and coplanar entity facilitates π - electron delocalization and induces strong π - π stacking for efficient charge transport . For example , Takimiya and co - workers reported four different NDTn isomers as shown in Figure 1 , which allowed to create a broad variety of NDTn - based polymer semiconductor materials , and high OFET performance with mobility of up to 0.77 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 based on PNDT3BT was achieved . 11 However , despite these numerous attractive properties of NDT - based polymer semiconductors , their limited solubility in organic solvents has hindered their widespread applications in organic electronics and optoelectronics . 12 To achieve the solubility and thin film uniformity required in solution processed OPVs and OFETs , NDT1 and NDT3 functionalized with two alkoxy groups were synthesized and applied in semiconductor materials recently (Figure 1) . 13 In addition , it was found that , compared with linear - fused NDT units , the copolymer incorporating the angular - fused NDT units can pack into higher ordered structures , thereby achieving higher OFET mobilities . It was also reported that angular - fused NDT has a lower - lying HOMO energy level than that of linearfused NDT , which could be beneficial for better air stability and greater open - circuit voltage (V oc) for polymer solar cells (PSCs) . 9c Very recently , our group reported a broad bandgap D - A copolymer PzNDTTPD based on 4,9 - bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)-naphtho [1,2 - b:5,6 - b′]dithiophene and thieno [3,4 - c]pyrrole-4,6dione (TPD) . 14 The polymer solar cells (PSCs) with PzNDTTPD as donor and [6,6]-phenyl - C71 - butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as acceptor demonstrated a PCE of 5.26 % with a high V oc of 0.91 V compared to the linear NDT - TPD - based copolymer PNDTTPD with a PCE of 4.0 % and a V oc of 0.69 V. 15 Meanwhile , high - performance p - channel fieldeffect transistors with hole mobility of 0.067 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and an on / off current ratio of 10 ^ 9 -10 ^ 10 were obtained .
