Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify any disease entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"somatic mosaicism\" - This is not a specific disease entity but rather a genetic phenomenon where an individual has two or more genetically distinct cell populations in their body. It is not a disease itself but can be associated with certain genetic disorders.\n\n2. \"molecular analysis\" - This is not a disease entity but rather a technique used to study genetic material, such as DNA and RNA, to identify potential disease-related mutations or abnormalities.\n\n3. \"DNA\" - DNA is not a disease entity but rather the genetic material present in all living organisms. It carries the genetic information that determines an individual's traits and can be analyzed to identify disease-related mutations.\n\n4. \"RNA\" - RNA is not a disease entity but rather a molecule involved in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis. It can be analyzed to study gene expression and identify potential disease-related abnormalities.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific disease entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
