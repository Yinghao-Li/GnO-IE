BZS (Bannayan-Zonana syndrome): This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple hamartomas (noncancerous growths) and macrocephaly (enlarged head size). It is caused by germline mutations in the PTEN gene.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are Germline PTEN mutations and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome (BZS)."},
