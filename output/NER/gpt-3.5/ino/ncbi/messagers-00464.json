Let's break down the paragraph and identify the disease entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"15q11 - q13 region\" - This is a chromosomal region, not a specific disease entity.\n\n2. \"imprinting centre (IC)\" - This is not a disease entity, but rather a specific region involved in the process of genomic imprinting.\n\n3. \"SNRPN\" - This is a gene, not a disease entity. It is located in the 15q11-q13 region and is associated with a genetic disorder called Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) when it is deleted or mutated.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific disease entities mentioned in this paragraph."},
