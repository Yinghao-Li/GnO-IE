Again, it does not mention a specific disease, but it suggests a potential cardiac condition.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there is no explicit mention of a specific disease entity. However, it does suggest that there may be a group of IVF patients with a characteristic electrocardiographic pattern, which could be related to a specific cardiac condition."},
