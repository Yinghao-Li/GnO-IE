So, this is not a disease entity.\n\n2. \"Mutation screening studies\": This phrase does not directly refer to a disease either. It refers to the process of screening for mutations, which are changes in the DNA sequence. So, this is not a disease entity.\n\n3. \"Patients with the disease\": Here, the phrase \"the disease\" refers to a specific disease that is not mentioned in the paragraph. Without further context, it is not possible to determine the specific disease entity being referred to.\n\nTherefore, based on the given paragraph, we cannot identify any specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned."},
