Major histocompatibility complex (MHC): The MHC is not a disease itself, but it is a genetic region that plays a crucial role in the immune system and is associated with various diseases, such as autoimmune disorders and certain types of cancer.\n\n2. Properdin factor B deficiency: This is a specific disease mentioned in the paragraph. Properdin factor B deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system and increases the risk of infections.\n\n3. Deficiency of the second component of complement: This is another specific disease mentioned in the paragraph. Deficiency of the second component of complement is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system's ability to fight off certain infections.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"Properdin factor B deficiency\" and \"Deficiency of the second component of complement.\""},
