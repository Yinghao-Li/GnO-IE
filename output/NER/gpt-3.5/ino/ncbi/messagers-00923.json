APC gene: The APC gene is not a disease entity, but it is associated with certain diseases. It stands for Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, which is a genetic condition that predisposes individuals to develop multiple polyps in the colon.\n\n2. I1307K polymorphism: This is not a disease entity either. It refers to a specific genetic variation (polymorphism) in the APC gene, which has been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.\n\n3. Ashkenazi Jewish population: Again, this is not a disease entity, but it refers to a specific ethnic group. Ashkenazi Jews have a higher prevalence of certain genetic disorders, including those related to the APC gene.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, there are no specific disease entities mentioned, but there are references to genetic variations and populations at risk for certain diseases."},

I1307K polymorphism: This refers to a specific genetic variation (polymorphism) in the APC gene, which has been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nPlease note that the APC gene itself is not a disease entity, but it is associated with certain diseases."},
