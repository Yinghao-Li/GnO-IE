ARSA: ARSA refers to Arylsulfatase A, which is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of certain molecules in the body. It is associated with a genetic disorder called Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD).\n\n2. GS: GS refers to Gaucher Syndrome, which is a genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase.\n\n3. Disease: The paragraph mentions \"clinical outbreak of the disease,\" which refers to the disease being discussed in the context. However, the specific disease is not mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the identified \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are ARSA and GS."},
