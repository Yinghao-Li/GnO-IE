WD (Wilson's disease): This is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene.\n\n2. CT (Copper toxicosis): This is another name for Wilson's disease, which is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are Wilson's disease (WD) and Copper toxicosis (CT)."},

WD (Wilson's disease): This is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene.\n\n2. CT (Copper toxicosis): This is another name for Wilson's disease, which is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity mentioned in the paragraph is Wilson's disease (WD) or Copper toxicosis (CT)."},
