Based on your request, let's remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" from the paragraph:\n\n1. \"RB1 gene mutation\" - This refers to a genetic mutation in the RB1 gene, which is associated with retinoblastoma, a type of eye cancer. This can be considered a disease-related entity.\n\n2. \"ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma\" - This specifically mentions \"retinoblastoma,\" which is a type of cancer. Therefore, it can be considered a disease-related entity.\n\n3. \"retinoblastoma\" - This is a type of cancer that starts in the retina of the eye. It is a clear disease-related entity.\n\nSo, the disease-related entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"RB1 gene mutation,\" \"ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma,\" and \"retinoblastoma.\""},
