Growth retardation: This phrase does not specifically mention a disease entity. It describes a condition of slowed growth.\n\n2. Smad4-deficient embryos: Smad4 refers to a gene involved in signaling pathways. The mention of Smad4-deficient embryos suggests a genetic condition or mutation, but it does not directly specify a disease.\n\n3. Reduced cell proliferation: This phrase describes a decrease in the rate of cell division. While reduced cell proliferation can be associated with various diseases, it is not explicitly mentioned as a specific disease in this paragraph.\n\n4. Increased apoptosis: Apoptosis refers to programmed cell death. Similar to reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis can be associated with various diseases, but it is not explicitly mentioned as a specific disease in this paragraph.\n\nBased on the information provided in the paragraph, there are no specific disease entities mentioned."},
