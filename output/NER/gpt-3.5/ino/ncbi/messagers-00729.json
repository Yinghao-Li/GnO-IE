Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"glycine to alanine substitution\": This phrase does not directly mention a specific disease, but it refers to a genetic mutation or variant that could potentially be associated with a disease.\n\n2. \"collagenous domain\": This phrase refers to a specific domain within a protein called collagen. Collagen-related diseases include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and various connective tissue disorders.\n\n3. \"heterozygous carriers\": This phrase does not directly mention a disease, but it refers to individuals who carry one copy of a mutated gene and one copy of a normal gene. Heterozygous carriers can be associated with various genetic diseases, depending on the specific mutation.\n\nIn summary, the paragraph does not explicitly mention a specific disease, but it discusses genetic variations and domains that could potentially be associated with diseases related to collagen or other genetic disorders."},
