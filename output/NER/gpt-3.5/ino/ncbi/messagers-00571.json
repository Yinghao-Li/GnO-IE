Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n1. \"hemostasis\" - This refers to the process of blood clotting and can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n\n2. \"bleeding time\" - This refers to the time it takes for bleeding to stop after an injury. While it is not a specific disease, it is mentioned in the context of defects, so it can be considered a disease entity.\n\n3. \"spontaneous bleeding events\" - This refers to instances of bleeding that occur without any apparent cause. It can be considered a disease entity.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"hemostasis,\" \"bleeding time,\" and \"spontaneous bleeding events.\""},
