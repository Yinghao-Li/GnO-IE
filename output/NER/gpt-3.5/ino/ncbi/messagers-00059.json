Let's remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" from the paragraph.\n\n1. \"HLA - B27 and B60\" - These are not diseases but rather human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers associated with certain diseases.\n\n2. \"probands\" - This term refers to individuals who are the first in a family to be affected by a disease or condition. It is not a disease itself.\n\n3. \"rate of disease concordance\" - This refers to the rate at which a disease occurs in both members of a twin pair. It is not a disease itself.\n\n4. \"DZ twin pairs\" - This refers to dizygotic (fraternal) twin pairs. It is not a disease itself.\n\n5. \"co-twin\" - This refers to the twin sibling of an individual. It is not a disease itself.\n\n6. \"B27 and DR1\" - These are HLA markers, not diseases.\n\nTherefore, the only entity that refers to a \"Disease\" in the paragraph is \"the disease,\" but it is not specified which disease it is."},
