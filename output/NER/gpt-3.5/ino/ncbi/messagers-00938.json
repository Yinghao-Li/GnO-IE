Invasive lobular cancers: This refers to a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands (lobules) of the breast and has the potential to spread to surrounding tissues.\n3. Low-grade ductal carcinomas: This refers to a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk ducts of the breast and is characterized by slow growth and less aggressive behavior compared to high-grade ductal carcinomas.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are: benign breast, invasive lobular cancers, and low-grade ductal carcinomas."},
