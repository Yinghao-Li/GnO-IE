It refers to a type of protein domain involved in cell signaling.\n\n3. LDL-receptor (LDLR) repeats - This is not a disease entity. It refers to a type of protein domain involved in the uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.\n\n4. transmembrane spanning domain - This is not a disease entity. It refers to a type of protein domain that spans the cell membrane.\n\n5. cytoplasmic domain - This is not a disease entity. It refers to a region of a protein that is located within the cytoplasm of a cell.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
