Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"Three other splice variants\" - This phrase does not mention any specific disease. It refers to different variations or forms of a gene or RNA molecule resulting from alternative splicing.\n\n2. \"exon 32\" - This is not a disease entity. Exons are segments of DNA or RNA that code for proteins.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},

Let's remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" from the paragraph:\n\nParagraph: Three other splice variants, including one derived from the skipping of exon 32, were also identified.\n\nIn this revised version, the phrase \"splice variants\" and \"exon 32\" do not refer to diseases.
