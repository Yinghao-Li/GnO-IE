DM expansion: This is likely referring to a specific disease or condition called \"DM\" (which stands for Myotonic Dystrophy). So, \"DM\" is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n2. affected parents: This implies that the parents have the disease or condition mentioned earlier, which is DM. So, \"DM\" is mentioned again as a disease entity.\n\n3. offspring: This refers to the children or descendants of the affected parents. Since the parents have DM, it is possible that the offspring may also have the disease. So, \"DM\" is mentioned once again as a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"DM\" (Myotonic Dystrophy)."},
