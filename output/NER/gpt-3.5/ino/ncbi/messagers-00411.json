Let's break down the paragraph and identify the disease entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"affected individuals\" - This phrase does not directly mention a specific disease, but it implies that there is a disease affecting these individuals.\n\n2. \"novel nonsense mutation\" - This phrase refers to a genetic mutation that causes a premature stop signal in the gene. It does not directly mention a specific disease, but it suggests that there is a disease associated with this mutation.\n\n3. \"exon 3 of the gene\" - This phrase refers to a specific region of a gene. It does not directly mention a disease.\n\n4. \"NPII\" - This is a gene mentioned in the paragraph. It does not directly mention a disease, but it suggests that there may be a disease associated with this gene.\n\nBased on the information provided in the paragraph, there is no specific disease entity mentioned.
