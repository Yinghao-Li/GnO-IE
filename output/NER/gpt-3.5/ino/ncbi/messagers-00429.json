The paragraph mainly discusses different types of mutations and their effects on the UBE3A protein.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that UBE3A is associated with a genetic disorder called Angelman syndrome. Angelman syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions in the UBE3A gene. Although the paragraph does not explicitly mention Angelman syndrome, it indirectly refers to the UBE3A protein, which is relevant to this disorder."},
