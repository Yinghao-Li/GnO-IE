Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify any \"Disease\" entities mentioned.\n\nStep 1: Identify potential disease-related terms or phrases.\n- \"smooth pursuit gain\"\n- \"trinucleotide repeats\"\n\nStep 2: Determine if these terms or phrases are related to diseases.\n- \"smooth pursuit gain\" does not directly indicate a disease. It refers to a measure of eye movement.\n- \"trinucleotide repeats\" can be associated with certain genetic disorders, such as Huntington's disease or Fragile X syndrome.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, there are no explicit mentions of diseases in the given paragraph. However, the term \"trinucleotide repeats\" is associated with genetic disorders, which can be considered as disease-related entities."},

Based on your request, let's remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" from the paragraph.\n\nParagraph: In addition, a correlation between smooth pursuit gain and the number of trinucleotide repeats was found.\n\nThe term \"smooth pursuit gain\" does not clearly refer to a disease. However, the term \"trinucleotide repeats\" can be associated with certain genetic disorders, such as Huntington's disease or Fragile X syndrome.\n\nSo, the revised paragraph with only disease-related entities is:\n\n\"In addition, a correlation between the number of trinucleotide repeats was found.\"\n\nPlease note that the revised paragraph may lose some context and coherence due to the removal of non-disease-related entities."},
