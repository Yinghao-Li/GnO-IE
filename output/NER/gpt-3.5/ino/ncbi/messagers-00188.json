Heterozygotes: This refers to individuals who are heterozygous for the A-T gene mutation. Heterozygotes are carriers of the Ataxia Telangiectasia gene mutation but do not typically show symptoms of the disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entity mentioned in the paragraph is Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T)."},
