Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"T-PLL\" - This is an abbreviation for T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, which is a rare type of blood cancer. So, \"T-PLL\" is a Disease entity.\n\n2. \"A-T\" - This is an abbreviation for ataxia-telangiectasia, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. So, \"A-T\" is a Disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the Disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"T-PLL\" and \"A-T\"."},

The paragraph mentions \"T-PLL\" and \"A-T,\" but these are not explicitly referred to as diseases in the given context.
