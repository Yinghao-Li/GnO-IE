    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. BRCA1: BRCA1 is a gene associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. While it is not explicitly mentioned as a disease in the paragraph, it is related to the pathogenesis of breast cancer.\n\n2. High-grade, ductal carcinomas: High-grade, ductal carcinomas refer to a type of breast cancer characterized by abnormal cells in the milk ducts. It is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n3. Sporadic breast cancers: Sporadic breast cancers refer to breast cancers that occur in individuals without a family history of the disease. It is another disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are high-grade, ductal carcinomas and sporadic breast cancers."},
