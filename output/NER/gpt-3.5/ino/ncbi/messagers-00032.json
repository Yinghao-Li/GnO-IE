Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify any \"Disease\" entities mentioned.\n\nStep 1: Identify potential disease-related terms or phrases.\n\nIn this paragraph, there doesn't seem to be any specific terms or phrases that directly indicate a disease. However, there is a mention of a \"constitutional mutation,\" which could potentially be related to a genetic disorder or disease.\n\nStep 2: Determine if the identified term or phrase is indeed a disease.\n\nTo confirm if \"constitutional mutation\" is related to a disease, we would need more context or information. Without further details, it is difficult to determine if it refers to a specific disease or condition.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, we cannot definitively identify any specific \"Disease\" entities."},
