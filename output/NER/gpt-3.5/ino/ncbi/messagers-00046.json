It refers to a measurement of the ability of blood serum to cause the lysis (breakdown) of red blood cells.\n\n2. Homozygous C5-deficient (C5D) sera: This refers to a condition where individuals have a deficiency in the C5 protein, which is involved in the complement system of the immune system. It can be considered a disease entity.\n\nSo, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"homozygous C5-deficient (C5D) sera\"."},
