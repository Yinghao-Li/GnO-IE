POMC gene defect - This is not a specific disease, but it is a genetic defect within the POMC gene that can lead to various endocrine disorders.\n\n2. Monogenic endocrine disorder - This is a general term referring to a disorder caused by a mutation in a single gene that affects the endocrine system.\n\n3. Early-onset obesity - This refers to a condition where a person develops obesity at an early age.\n\n4. Adrenal insufficiency - This is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones.\n\n5. Red hair pigmentation - This is not a disease, but it is a characteristic mentioned in relation to the genetic defect.\n\nSo, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are early-onset obesity and adrenal insufficiency."},
