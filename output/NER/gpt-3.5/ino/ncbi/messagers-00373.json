Therefore, \"IDMS patients\" refers to individuals who have been diagnosed with this disease.\n\n3. \"genetic heterogeneity\": This phrase does not directly refer to a specific disease but suggests that there may be different genetic causes or variations within the disease mentioned earlier (IDMS).\n\nBased on the paragraph, the identified \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n- WT1 mutations (associated with various diseases)\n- IDMS (Infantile Desmoid-type Fibromatosis)"},
