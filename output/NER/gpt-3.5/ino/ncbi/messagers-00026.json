Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"tumors\" - This is not a specific disease entity, but rather a general term referring to abnormal growths of cells. It is not a specific disease.\n\n2. \"mutations\" - This is not a disease entity either. Mutations refer to changes in the DNA sequence, which can contribute to the development of diseases, but it is not a disease itself.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph."},

Based on your request, let's remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" from the paragraph:\n\nParagraph: For 39 randomly selected tumors, SSCP, hetero-duplex analysis, sequencing, and Southern blot analysis were used to identify mutations.\n\nAfter removing entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease,\" the revised paragraph becomes:\n\n\"For 39 randomly selected tumors, mutations were identified using SSCP, hetero-duplex analysis, sequencing, and Southern blot analysis.\"\n\nIn this revised version, the focus is on the identification of mutations in tumors, which can be associated with various diseases."},
