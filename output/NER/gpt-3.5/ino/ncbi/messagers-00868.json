PAX6 mutation analysis: This refers to the analysis of mutations in the PAX6 gene. While not explicitly mentioned as a disease, mutations in the PAX6 gene can lead to various eye disorders, including aniridia.\n\n2. Aniridia: This is a genetic disorder characterized by the partial or complete absence of the iris in the eye. It is mentioned in the context of phenotypes distinct from textbook aniridia, indicating that there may be other related eye disorders being discussed.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are PAX6 mutation analysis and aniridia."},
