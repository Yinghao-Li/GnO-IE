MPS IVA stands for Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA, also known as Morquio A syndrome.\n\n2. \"clinical phenotypes\" - This phrase refers to different presentations or manifestations of the disease. While not a specific disease entity, it is related to the study of diseases.\n\nSo, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"MPS IVA\" or Morquio A syndrome."},
