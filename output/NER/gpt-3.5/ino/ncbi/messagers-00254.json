A-T (Ataxia Telangiectasia): This is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. It is mentioned in the paragraph as \"A - T patients.\" This entity clearly refers to a disease.\n\n2. ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated): This is a protein that is mutated in individuals with Ataxia Telangiectasia. It is mentioned in the paragraph as \"mutant ATM protein.\" While ATM is not a disease itself, it is associated with the disease Ataxia Telangiectasia. Therefore, we can consider it as a related entity.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T)."},
