Germline mutations: This phrase does not refer to a specific disease but rather describes a type of genetic mutation that occurs in the reproductive cells (germline cells).\n\n2. ATM gene: This refers to a specific gene called ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated). Mutations in this gene can lead to various diseases.\n\n3. Autosomal recessive disorder: This phrase describes the inheritance pattern of the disease. It means that the disease is caused by two copies of a mutated gene, one inherited from each parent.\n\n4. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T): This is the specific disease mentioned in the paragraph. It is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple systems in the body, including the nervous system and immune system.\n\nSo, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T)\"."},
