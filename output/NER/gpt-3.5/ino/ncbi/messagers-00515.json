ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone) - This is a hormone that stimulates the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands. It is mentioned in the context of its synthesis being interfered with due to the mutations in exon 3.\n\n2. alpha-MSH (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) - This is a hormone that plays a role in regulating skin pigmentation and inflammation. It is also mentioned in the context of its synthesis being interfered with due to the mutations in exon 3.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are ACTH and alpha-MSH."},
