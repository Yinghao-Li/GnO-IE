Phenotype: Again, this is not a specific disease entity, but it refers to the observable characteristics or traits of an individual, which can include both normal and abnormal features. In this context, it is mentioned that the glycine substitution is not associated with any obvious phenotype, indicating that it does not result in any noticeable disease or abnormality.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific disease entities mentioned in this paragraph."},
