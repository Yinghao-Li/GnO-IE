Turkish A-T founder mutation: This refers to a specific mutation associated with Ataxia Telangiectasia that is commonly found in the Turkish population. It is referred to as a \"founder mutation\" because it is believed to have originated from a common ancestor.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entity mentioned in the paragraph is Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T)."},
