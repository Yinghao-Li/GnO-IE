Mutations: While not a specific disease, mutations can be associated with various genetic disorders or diseases. In this context, the mutations are being analyzed in relation to the PDS gene and its potential association with Pendred syndrome.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are Pendred syndrome and the potential diseases associated with the identified mutations."},

Based on your request, let's remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" from the paragraph:\n\nParagraph: We performed mutation analysis of the PDS gene in patients from 14 Pendred families originating from seven countries and identified all mutations.\n\nIn this case, the only entity that clearly refers to a \"Disease\" is Pendred syndrome. The other entity mentioned, mutations, does not directly refer to a specific disease but rather to the analysis of genetic changes in the PDS gene. Therefore, we can remove the mention of mutations as a disease entity."},
