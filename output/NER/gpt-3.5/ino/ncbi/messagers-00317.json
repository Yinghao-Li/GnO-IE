Mutations: Mutations can be associated with various diseases, but the paragraph does not specify any particular disease.\n\n3. Nonsense codons: Nonsense codons are also known as premature stop codons, which can lead to the production of truncated or non-functional proteins. While not a specific disease, nonsense codons can be associated with genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\nOverall, the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific disease entities."},
