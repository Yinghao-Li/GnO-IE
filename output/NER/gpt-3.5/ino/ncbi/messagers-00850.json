Intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity: This phrase does not directly refer to a specific disease, but it indicates that there is variation in the clinical presentation (phenotype) of the disease within the same family. It suggests that the disease being discussed may have different manifestations or severity among family members.\n\nSo, the identified \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD)."},
