Saethre-Chotzen syndrome: This is a genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones. It is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n2. TWIST mutations: TWIST refers to a gene that is associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Mutations in this gene can lead to the development of the disease. Therefore, TWIST mutations can be considered a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n3. FGFR mutations: FGFR refers to the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene. Mutations in this gene can also be associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Therefore, FGFR mutations can be considered a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, TWIST mutations, and FGFR mutations."},
