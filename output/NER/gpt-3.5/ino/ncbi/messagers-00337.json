SCA1: SCA1 stands for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1, which is a genetic disease that affects the cerebellum. Therefore, SCA1 is a \"Disease\" entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n2. Hypermetria: Hypermetria is a condition characterized by an overestimation of movement resulting in overshooting the target. While it is not explicitly mentioned as a disease in the paragraph, it is often associated with cerebellar dysfunction, which is a characteristic of SCA1. Therefore, we can consider hypermetria as a related symptom or manifestation of the disease.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are SCA1."},
