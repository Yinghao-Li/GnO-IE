Gastrulate: This is not a disease entity, but it refers to a developmental process in embryos. It is not directly related to a specific disease.\n\n4. Mesodermal marker: This is not a disease entity, but it refers to a specific marker or characteristic of mesodermal cells during embryonic development. It is not directly related to a specific disease.\n\n5. Abnormal visceral endoderm development: This is not a specific disease entity, but it refers to abnormal development of the visceral endoderm, which is a layer of cells in the early embryo.
