University: This is another location entity mentioned in the paragraph. Again, without further context, it is difficult to determine the specific university being referred to. It could be a local university or a specific institution.\n\n3. Restaurant: While not explicitly mentioned as a location, restaurants are typically associated with specific places. In this case, the restaurant owners mentioned in the paragraph could be located in a particular city or area.\n\nOverall, the paragraph mentions two potential location entities: YIT and University.

Without further context, it is difficult to determine if it is a location or an abbreviation for an organization or institution. Therefore, we will remove it from the list.\n\n2. University: This entity refers to a location, specifically an educational institution. Although the specific university is not mentioned, it is generally associated with a physical location.\n\n3. Restaurant: This entity does not clearly refer to a location. While restaurants are typically associated with specific places, the paragraph does not provide enough information to determine the exact location of the restaurant mentioned. Therefore, we will remove it from the list.\n\nBased on the revised analysis, the only \"Location\" entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"University.\""},
