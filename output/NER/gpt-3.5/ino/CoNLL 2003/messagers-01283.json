Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the \"Location\" entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"Meyers\": This is a location entity mentioned in the sentence. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact location. It could refer to a specific place, such as a city or town, or it could be a person's last name. More information is needed to provide a specific explanation.\n\n2. \"American\": While \"American\" typically refers to a nationality rather than a location, in this context, it could be interpreted as a location entity. It suggests that the incident occurred in America or involved an American individual. Again, without more context, it is challenging to provide a specific explanation.\n\nIn summary, the paragraph mentions two potential \"Location\" entities: \"Meyers\" and \"American.\" However, without additional information, it is difficult to determine the exact locations they refer to."},
