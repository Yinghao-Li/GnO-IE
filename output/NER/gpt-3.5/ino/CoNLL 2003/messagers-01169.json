Newmont: This is another \"Person\" entity mentioned in the paragraph. Similar to Homestake, Newmont is not an individual person but a company or organization. The paragraph mentions a number associated with Newmont, indicating that there is a specific offer or proposal made by Newmont that someone else might be willing to surpass."},
