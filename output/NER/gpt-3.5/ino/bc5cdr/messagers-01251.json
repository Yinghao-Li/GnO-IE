Stopping minocycline: In this phrase, \"minocycline\" is mentioned. Minocycline is a chemical compound and belongs to the class of antibiotics known as tetracyclines.\n\n2. Amelioration of symptoms: In this phrase, no specific chemical entity is mentioned. It refers to the improvement or relief of symptoms.\n\n3. Normalization of CRP level: In this phrase, \"CRP\" is mentioned. CRP stands for C-reactive protein, which is a chemical substance produced by the liver in response to inflammation.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"minocycline\" and \"CRP.\""},
