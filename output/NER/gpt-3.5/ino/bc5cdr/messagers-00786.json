Let's break down the paragraph and identify the disease entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"Cortical laminar necrosis\" - This is a disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n2. \"Ischemic changes\" - This is not a specific disease entity, but it refers to a condition where there is reduced blood flow to a particular area, leading to tissue damage. It can be associated with various diseases.\n\n3. \"Subcortical white matter\" - This is not a specific disease entity, but it refers to the inner layers of the brain that are located beneath the cerebral cortex. Diseases affecting this area can include white matter diseases such as leukoencephalopathy or multiple sclerosis.\n\n4. \"Left putamen\" - The putamen is a part of the basal ganglia in the brain. The mention of \"ischemic changes\" in the left putamen suggests a disease entity affecting this area, such as ischemic stroke or vascular dementia.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"cortical laminar necrosis\" and the possible diseases affecting the \"subcortical white matter\" and the \"left putamen\" include ischemic stroke, leukoencephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and vascular dementia."},
