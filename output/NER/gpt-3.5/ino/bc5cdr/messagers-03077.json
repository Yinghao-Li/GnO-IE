Oxidative stress: This is not a specific disease, but rather a condition that can contribute to the development of various diseases.\n\n2. Epileptogenesis: This refers to the process by which a normal brain becomes susceptible to seizures and develops epilepsy. It is not a specific disease, but rather a stage in the development of epilepsy.\n\n3. Cognitive deficits: This refers to a range of impairments in cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and problem-solving. Again, it is not a specific disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of various underlying conditions.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned. Instead, it discusses the role of oxidative stress in epileptogenesis and cognitive deficits."},

Antioxidants - These are substances that can prevent or slow damage to cells caused by free radicals, which are highly reactive molecules that can cause oxidative stress. Antioxidants can be natural or synthetic compounds, such as vitamins (e.g., vitamin C, vitamin E), minerals (e.g., selenium, zinc), and plant-derived compounds (e.g., flavonoids, polyphenols).\n\nPlease note that while oxidative stress and antioxidants are not specific chemical entities, they are related to the topic of interest in the paragraph."},
