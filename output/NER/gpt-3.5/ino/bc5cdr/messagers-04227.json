    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n1. Lidocaine: Lidocaine is a medication used to numb tissue in a specific area and is commonly used as a local anesthetic. While it is not a disease itself, it is mentioned in relation to potential toxicity when used in patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction (MI).\n\n2. Cocaine-associated MI: This refers to myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, that is associated with cocaine use. MI is a disease characterized by the death of heart muscle due to the blockage of blood flow to the heart.\n\n3. Cardiovascular toxicity: This refers to the potential harmful effects on the cardiovascular system, such as the heart and blood vessels. In this context, it is mentioned in relation to the use of lidocaine in patients with cocaine-associated MI.\n\n4. Central nervous system toxicity: This refers to the potential harmful effects on the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord. In this context, it is mentioned in relation to the use of lidocaine in patients with cocaine-associated MI.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n- Cocaine-associated MI\n- Cardiovascular toxicity\n- Central nervous system toxicity"},
