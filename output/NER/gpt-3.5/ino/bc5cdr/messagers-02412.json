So, we can consider this as a disease-related entity.\n\n2. MDA level: MDA stands for malondialdehyde, which is a marker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. While it is not a disease itself, increased MDA levels are often associated with various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.\n\nTherefore, the disease-related entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"isoproterenol-treated rats\" and \"MDA level.\""},
