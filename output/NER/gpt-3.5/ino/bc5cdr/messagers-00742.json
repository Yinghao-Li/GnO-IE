Disease: The paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific disease. However, it does mention that ACE inhibitors modify the progression of disease, which implies that there is a disease being referred to, but it is not specified.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, the only specific \"Disease\" entity mentioned is not explicitly stated."},
