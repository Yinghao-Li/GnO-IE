Immunocytochemistry: This is a technique used in biology and medicine to detect specific proteins or antigens in cells. It is not a disease entity.\n\n2. h-SOD1: This refers to a specific form of the enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). SOD1 mutations are associated with a subset of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease.\n\n3. Inner ear tissues: This refers to the anatomical structures within the ear responsible for hearing and balance. It is not a disease entity.\n\n4. Transgenic C57BL/6-TgN [SOD1] 3Cje mice: This refers to a specific strain of genetically modified mice that overexpress the SOD1 gene. These mice are used as a model for studying ALS, a neurodegenerative disease.\n\nBased on the paragraph, the only disease entity mentioned is ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)."},
