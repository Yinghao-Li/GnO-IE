Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\nStep 1: Identify potential chemical entities\nIn this paragraph, there are no explicit mentions of chemical entities. However, we can infer that there might be some chemical entities related to the occurrence of cataract and raised intraocular pressure.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the context\nThe paragraph mentions the occurrence of cataract and raised intraocular pressure. While these conditions are not directly related to chemicals, they can be influenced by various factors, including chemical substances. Therefore, we can consider the possibility of chemical entities being involved.\n\nStep 3: Final analysis\nBased on the given paragraph, we cannot definitively identify any specific chemical entities. However, it is worth noting that the occurrence of cataract and raised intraocular pressure can be influenced by various chemical substances, such as medications, toxins, or environmental factors. To provide a more accurate identification of chemical entities, additional information or context would be needed."},
