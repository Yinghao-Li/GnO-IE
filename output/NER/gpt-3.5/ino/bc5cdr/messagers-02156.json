Thrombosis: Thrombosis is a medical condition characterized by the formation of a blood clot within a blood vessel. It is a chemical entity related to blood clotting.\n\n2. Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by a low platelet count in the blood. Platelets are involved in blood clotting, so thrombocytopenia is also a chemical entity related to blood clotting.\n\n3. HIT (Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia): HIT is an abbreviation for Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is a condition where the use of the anticoagulant drug heparin leads to a decrease in platelet count.
