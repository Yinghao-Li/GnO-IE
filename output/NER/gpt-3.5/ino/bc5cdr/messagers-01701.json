Adverse effects: This refers to the negative or unwanted effects that can occur as a result of taking a medication, such as amiodarone.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, there are no specific diseases mentioned, but rather references to a drug used to treat heart rhythm problems, the potential life-threatening symptom of tachycardia, and the adverse effects that can occur."},
