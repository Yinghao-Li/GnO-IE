These include:\n\n1. Airway: This refers to the respiratory system and can be associated with diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n2. FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second): This is a measurement used to assess lung function and can be affected by various respiratory diseases.\n3. FEF25-75 (Forced Expiratory Flow between 25% and 75% of the forced vital capacity): This is another measurement used to assess lung function and can also be affected by respiratory diseases.\n4. HR (Heart Rate): While not directly related to a specific disease, abnormal heart rate can be a symptom of various cardiovascular conditions.\n5. Tremor: Tremors can be associated with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease or essential tremor.\n6. K (Potassium): Abnormal levels of potassium in the body can be indicative of certain diseases, such as kidney disease or adrenal gland disorders.\n7. Glu (Glucose): Abnormal glucose levels can be associated with diabetes or other metabolic disorders.\n\nIt's important to note that the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific diseases, but rather refers to symptoms and measurements that can be associated with various conditions."},
