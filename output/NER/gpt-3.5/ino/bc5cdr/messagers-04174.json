Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify any \"Chemical\" entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"experimental data\" - This phrase does not refer to a specific chemical entity but rather to the results of an experiment.\n\n2. \"medial changes\" - This phrase does not refer to a chemical entity either. It likely refers to changes in the middle layer of arterial walls.\n\n3. \"arterial spasm\" - This phrase does not directly refer to a chemical entity. It describes a medical condition characterized by the sudden constriction of arteries.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no specific \"Chemical\" entities mentioned."},
