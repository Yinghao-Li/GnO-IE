Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify any \"Chemical\" entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"No significant heart rate differences\": In this phrase, there is no mention of any specific \"Chemical\" entity.

It refers to two groups, one being the \"sham\" group and the other being the \"lesioned\" group.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},

Let's analyze the paragraph again and remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Chemical\" entities.\n\n1. \"No significant heart rate differences\": This phrase does not refer to a specific \"Chemical\" entity, so we can remove it.\n\n2. \"sham and lesioned groups\": This phrase does not directly refer to \"Chemical\" entities either, so we can remove it as well.\n\nAfter removing the entities that do not clearly refer to \"Chemical\" entities, we are left with no specific entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
