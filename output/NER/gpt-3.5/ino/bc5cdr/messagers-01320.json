Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"Negative symptom outcomes\" - This does not refer to a specific chemical entity. It is a general term referring to the outcomes related to negative symptoms in a medical context.\n\n2. \"Parkinsonism\" - This term refers to a set of symptoms that resemble Parkinson's disease. It is not directly related to a specific chemical entity, but it is associated with a decrease in dopamine levels in the brain.\n\n3. \"Akathisia\" - This term refers to a movement disorder characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness. It is not directly related to a specific chemical entity, but it can be a side effect of certain medications, such as antipsychotics.\n\n4. \"medications\" - This term refers to the drugs or substances being compared in the study. Without further context, it is not possible to identify specific chemical entities.\n\nTherefore, in this paragraph, there are no specific chemical entities mentioned."},
