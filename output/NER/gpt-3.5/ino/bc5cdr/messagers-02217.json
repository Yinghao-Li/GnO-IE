Phosphorylated Smad3: This is a chemical entity. \"Phosphorylated\" indicates that Smad3 has undergone a phosphorylation process.\n\n2. Immunoprecipitation: This is a technique used to isolate specific proteins or molecules from a mixture using an antibody. While it is not a chemical entity itself, it is a method involving the use of chemicals.\n\n3. Western blotting: This is a technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample using antibodies. Similar to immunoprecipitation, it is a method involving the use of chemicals.\n\n4. Confocal microscopy: This is a technique used to obtain high-resolution images of a sample using a laser scanning microscope. Again, it is not a chemical entity itself, but a method involving the use of chemicals.\n\nSo, the chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"Phosphorylated Smad3.\""},
