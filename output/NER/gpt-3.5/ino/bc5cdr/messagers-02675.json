Seizures: This is not a disease entity, but a symptom that can be associated with various underlying conditions or diseases.\n4. Total bilirubin: This is not a disease entity, but a laboratory test used to assess liver function. Elevated levels of bilirubin can indicate liver disease.\n5. TAC level: This is not a disease entity, but a reference to trough levels of Tacrolimus, which is an immunosuppressive drug commonly used after liver transplantation. It is not a disease itself.\n\nSo, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"pediatric end-stage liver disease.\""},
