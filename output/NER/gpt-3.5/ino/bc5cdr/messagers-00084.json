Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"transthoracic echocardiography\" - This is a medical imaging technique that uses ultrasound to visualize the heart. It does not mention any specific chemicals.\n\n2. \"baseline\" - This refers to the initial measurement taken before any tests or interventions. It does not mention any specific chemicals.\n\n3. \"regular intervals\" - This refers to the time points at which measurements were taken. It does not mention any specific chemicals.\n\n4. \"each test\" - This refers to the different tests or interventions performed. It does not mention any specific chemicals.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no specific chemical entities mentioned."},
