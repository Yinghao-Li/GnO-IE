Coronary CTA strategy - This refers to a medical imaging technique used to visualize the coronary arteries. While not explicitly mentioned as a disease, it is related to the evaluation of potential cardiovascular diseases.\n\n2. Cocaine-associated chest pain - This refers to chest pain that is associated with cocaine use. It is not a specific disease, but rather a symptom or manifestation of potential cardiovascular issues caused by cocaine use.\n\n3. Coronary vasospasm - This refers to the constriction or narrowing of the coronary arteries, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the heart. It is a condition that can cause ischemia, a lack of blood supply to tissues, including the heart.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are coronary vasospasm and potential cardiovascular diseases associated with cocaine use."},
