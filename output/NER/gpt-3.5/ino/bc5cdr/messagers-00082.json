It is a type of chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood flow.\n\n2. \"Coronary artery disease\" - This is also a disease entity. It is a condition where the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of plaque.\n\nSo, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"stable angina\" and \"coronary artery disease\"."},
