Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n1. cTnI elevations: This refers to elevated levels of cardiac troponin I, which is a protein marker used to diagnose heart damage or injury. While it is not a specific disease, it is an indicator of potential heart-related conditions.\n\n2. CK-MB criteria for MI: CK-MB refers to creatine kinase-MB, which is an enzyme found in the heart muscle. MI stands for myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack. Therefore, this phrase refers to the criteria used to diagnose a heart attack, which is a disease.\n\n3. Underlying significant disease: This phrase suggests the presence of an unspecified disease that is significant and potentially related to the elevated cTnI levels mentioned earlier. The specific disease is not mentioned, so it remains unidentified.\n\nIn summary, the identified \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are MI (myocardial infarction) and an unspecified underlying significant disease."},

Based on your request, let's remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" from the paragraph.\n\n1. cTnI elevations: This refers to elevated levels of cardiac troponin I, which is a protein marker used to diagnose heart damage or injury.

The specific disease is not mentioned, so it remains unidentified. Let's keep this entity.\n\nAfter removing the entity that does not clearly refer to \"Disease,\" we are left with the following:\n\n- CK-MB criteria for MI: Referring to the criteria used to diagnose a heart attack, which is a disease.\n- Underlying significant disease: Referring to an unspecified disease that is significant and potentially related to the elevated cTnI levels.\n\nPlease note that the specific disease mentioned in the paragraph remains unidentified."},
