Let's identify the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n1. aplastic crisis - This is a medical condition characterized by a decrease in the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the bone marrow. \"aplastic crisis\" is not a chemical entity but a medical condition.\n\n2. septicemia - This is a severe bloodstream infection caused by bacteria. \"septicemia\" is not a chemical entity but a medical condition.\n\n3. abnormalities - This term refers to deviations or irregularities in the normal structure or function of organs or tissues. \"abnormalities\" is not a chemical entity but a general term.\n\n4. liver function - This refers to the overall functioning of the liver, including its ability to process and metabolize substances. \"liver function\" is not a chemical entity but a general term.\n\n5. hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia - This is a condition characterized by bleeding and inflammation in the lungs. \"hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia\" is not a chemical entity but a medical condition.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
