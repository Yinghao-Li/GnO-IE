Coronary CTA: This refers to a medical imaging technique called Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography, which is used to visualize the coronary arteries. While it is not a disease itself, it is related to the study of cardiovascular diseases.\n\n2. Cocaine-associated chest pain: This refers to chest pain that is associated with cocaine use. It is a symptom that can be caused by various underlying conditions, such as myocardial infarction or angina, which are diseases related to the heart.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n- Coronary artery disease (implied by the mention of coronary CTA)\n- Cocaine-associated chest pain (implied by the mention of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain)"},
