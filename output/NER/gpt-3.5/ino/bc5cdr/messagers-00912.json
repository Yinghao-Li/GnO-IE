Dexamphetamine stereotypy: This is a behavior associated with the use of dexamphetamine, which can be considered a disease entity.\n\n2. Haloperidol catalepsy: Catalepsy is a neurological condition characterized by a loss of voluntary movement and a rigid posture. In this case, it is associated with the use of haloperidol, a medication used to treat certain mental disorders.\n\n3. Ergometrine-induced WDS behavior: WDS behavior refers to withdrawal symptoms, which can be considered a disease entity. In this case, it is induced by the use of ergometrine, a medication used to induce labor or control bleeding after childbirth.\n\n4. Fluoxetine-induced penile erections: Penile erections can be considered a normal physiological response, but in this case, it is induced by the use of fluoxetine, a medication used to treat depression and other mental health conditions.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are dexamphetamine stereotypy, haloperidol catalepsy, ergometrine-induced WDS behavior, and fluoxetine-induced penile erections."},
