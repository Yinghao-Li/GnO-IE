Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"mg/kg per day\" - This is a unit of measurement used to indicate the dosage of a chemical substance. In this case, it is not specified which chemical substance is being referred to.\n\n2. \"renal and liver function test results\" - This refers to medical tests that assess the functioning of the kidneys and liver. While it does not explicitly mention any specific chemical entities, it implies that the tests were conducted to evaluate the levels of certain chemicals or enzymes related to renal and liver function.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no specific chemical entities mentioned."},

Based on the revised criteria, let's identify the entities that clearly refer to \"Chemical\" in the paragraph:\n\n1. \"mg/kg per day\" - This unit of measurement is commonly used to indicate the dosage of a chemical substance.\n\nTherefore, the only entity that clearly refers to \"Chemical\" in the paragraph is \"mg/kg per day\"."},
