Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"Tetracycline\": This is a chemical compound used as an antibiotic. It is mentioned in the sentence as \"altered disposition of tetracycline.\" So, \"tetracycline\" is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n2. \"Oleic acid\": This is a fatty acid commonly found in various oils and fats. It is mentioned in the sentence as \"altered uptake of oleic acid.\" So, \"oleic acid\" is another chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"tetracycline\" and \"oleic acid.\""},
