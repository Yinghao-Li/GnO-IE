Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\nStep 1: Identify potential chemical entities\nIn this paragraph, there doesn't seem to be any explicit mention of chemical entities. However, there is a mention of \"general anesthesia,\" which could potentially involve the use of chemical substances.\n\nStep 2: Confirm the chemical entity\nTo confirm whether \"general anesthesia\" involves the use of chemical substances, we can consult external knowledge. General anesthesia typically involves the administration of various drugs, including anesthetics, analgesics, and muscle relaxants, which are chemical substances.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"general anesthesia.\""},
