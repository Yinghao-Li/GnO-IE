While it is not explicitly mentioned as a disease, it can be considered as a health condition related to the kidneys.\n\n2. HD-MTX therapy: This refers to a specific type of therapy using high-dose methotrexate. Methotrexate is commonly used to treat certain types of cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n\n3. Ileostoma: This refers to a surgical opening in the abdomen that allows waste to pass out of the body after the removal of the colon or rectum. While it is not a disease itself, it is related to a surgical procedure.\n\n4. Total parenteral nutrition: This refers to a method of providing nutrition to the body through intravenous feeding. Again, it is not a disease but a medical intervention.\n\nTherefore, in this paragraph, the only disease entity mentioned is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the patient is being treated for a specific condition that requires HD-MTX therapy."},

It typically involves the administration of a mixture of nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"MTX\" (methotrexate) and the nutrients used in total parenteral nutrition."},

HD-MTX therapy: This refers to the administration of high-dose methotrexate (MTX), which is a chemotherapy drug.
