Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n1. \"Doxorubicin-treated animals\" - This phrase does not directly mention a specific disease. However, it suggests that the animals were treated with doxorubicin, which is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer. Therefore, we can infer that the animals might have had cancer as the underlying disease.\n\n2. \"Enlarged hearts\" - This phrase suggests the presence of a disease related to the heart, such as cardiomegaly or heart enlargement.\n\n3. \"Hypertrophic atria\" - This phrase indicates the presence of a disease related to the atria of the heart, specifically atrial hypertrophy.\n\nBased on the information provided, the identified \"Disease\" entities are cancer (possibly) and heart-related diseases such as cardiomegaly and atrial hypertrophy."},
