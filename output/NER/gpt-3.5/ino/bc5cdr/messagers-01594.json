Liver enzymes: This refers to a group of enzymes produced by the liver that are involved in various metabolic processes. While not a specific disease, abnormal levels of liver enzymes can indicate liver damage or disease.\n\n2. HCV (Hepatitis C Virus): This is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver and can lead to chronic liver disease.\n\n3. HBeAg (Hepatitis B e Antigen): This is a protein produced by the Hepatitis B virus and is used as a marker for active viral replication. Its presence indicates an active Hepatitis B infection.\n\n4. Anti-HBe (Antibody to Hepatitis B e Antigen): This refers to the presence of antibodies against the HBeAg protein. The presence of anti-HBe indicates a transition from an active to an inactive Hepatitis B infection.\n\nPlease note that while liver enzymes are not a specific disease, they are mentioned in the context of testing for liver disease or damage."},
