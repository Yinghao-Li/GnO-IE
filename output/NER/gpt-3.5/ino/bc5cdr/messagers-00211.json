Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n1. \"piloerection\" - This refers to the involuntary erection or raising of hairs on the skin, often caused by cold or fear. While it is not a disease itself, it can be a symptom of certain medical conditions such as anxiety disorders or certain drug side effects.\n\n2. \"headache\" - This refers to a pain or discomfort in the head or upper neck. Headaches can be caused by various factors, including tension, stress, sinus problems, or certain medical conditions.\n\n3. \"cold extremities\" - This refers to the sensation of coldness in the extremities, such as the hands and feet. It can be a symptom of various conditions, including poor circulation, nerve damage, or certain diseases like Raynaud's disease.\n\nIn summary, the paragraph mentions symptoms (piloerection, headache) and a sensation (cold extremities) that can be associated with certain medical conditions, but they are not specific diseases themselves."},
