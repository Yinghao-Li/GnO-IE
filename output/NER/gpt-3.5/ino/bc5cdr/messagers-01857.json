CB1 receptors are a type of cannabinoid receptors found in the brain and other parts of the body.\n\n2. Neuroprotection against dopaminergic lesion: This refers to a potential protective effect against damage to dopaminergic neurons. Dopaminergic lesion is not a specific disease, but it can be associated with conditions such as Parkinson's disease.\n\n3. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias: This refers to a specific type of movement disorder called dyskinesias that can be induced by the medication L-DOPA. L-DOPA is commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are Parkinson's disease and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias."},
