Acute viral myocarditis: In this case, there is no specific chemical entity mentioned. It refers to an acute inflammation of the heart muscle caused by a viral infection.\n\n2. Carbamazepine: This is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. Carbamazepine is a medication used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. In this case, it is mentioned as the cause of acute eosinophilic myocarditis.\n\n3. Acute eosinophilic myocarditis: This is a condition mentioned in the paragraph. It refers to an acute inflammation of the heart muscle characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. In this case, it is mentioned as being induced by carbamazepine.\n\n4. Cardiac hemosiderosis: This is a condition mentioned in the paragraph. It refers to the accumulation of iron in the heart tissue. In this case, it is mentioned as resulting in acute cardiogenic shock.\n\nTo summarize, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are carbamazepine."},
