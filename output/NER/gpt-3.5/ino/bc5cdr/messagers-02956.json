It refers to the variability within an individual.\n\n2. VAS response: This is not a disease entity. It refers to the response measured using the Visual Analog Scale.\n\n3. Von Frey: This is not a disease entity. It refers to a type of filament used to measure mechanical sensitivity.\n\n4. Secondary hyperalgesia: This is a disease entity. It refers to increased sensitivity to pain in areas surrounding an injury or inflammation.\n\n5. Allodynia: This is a disease entity. It refers to the perception of pain from non-painful stimuli.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"secondary hyperalgesia\" and \"allodynia\"."},
