Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"Cardiac hypertrophy\" - This is a condition characterized by an increase in the size of the heart muscle cells. \"Hypertrophy\" is not a chemical entity, but it is a medical condition related to the heart.\n\n2. \"Dilatation\" - This refers to the enlargement or widening of a blood vessel or a hollow organ. Again, \"dilatation\" is not a chemical entity, but a medical condition.\n\n3. \"Focal myocardial degeneration\" - This refers to the localized damage or deterioration of the heart muscle tissue. \"Myocardial\" refers to the heart muscle, and \"degeneration\" refers to the breakdown or deterioration of tissue. Again, these are not chemical entities, but medical conditions.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
