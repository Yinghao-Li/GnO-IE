Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n1. \"ecstasy users\" - This refers to individuals who use ecstasy, which is a recreational drug. While ecstasy itself is not a disease, its use can lead to various health issues, including neurocognitive and sleep-related impairments.\n\n2. \"neurocognitive impairments\" - This refers to a type of impairment that affects cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving. Neurocognitive impairments can be caused by various factors, including drug use.\n\n3. \"sleep-related impairments\" - This refers to impairments that affect sleep patterns and quality. Sleep-related impairments can also be caused by various factors, including drug use.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, the identified \"Disease\" entities are neurocognitive impairments and sleep-related impairments."},

Based on your request, let's remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" from the paragraph.\n\n1. \"ecstasy users\" - While ecstasy use can lead to health issues, it is not a disease itself. Therefore, we can remove this entity.\n\n2. \"neurocognitive impairments\" - This entity refers to a type of impairment that affects cognitive functions and can be caused by various factors, including drug use. It can be considered as a disease-related entity.\n\n3. \"sleep-related impairments\" - This entity refers to impairments that affect sleep patterns and quality and can also be caused by various factors, including drug use. It can be considered as a disease-related entity.\n\nSo, after removing the entity \"ecstasy users,\" the remaining disease-related entities in the paragraph are \"neurocognitive impairments\" and \"sleep-related impairments.\""},
