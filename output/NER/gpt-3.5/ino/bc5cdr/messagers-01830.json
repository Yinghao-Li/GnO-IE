It stands for micrograms, which is a unit of measurement.\n\n3. kg - This is not a chemical entity. It stands for kilograms, which is a unit of measurement.\n\n4. min - This is not a chemical entity. It stands for minutes, which is a unit of time.\n\n5. bolus - This is not a chemical entity. It refers to a single, large dose of medication given all at once.\n\n6.
