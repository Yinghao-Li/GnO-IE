Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"adenosine receptor agonists\" - This is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. Adenosine receptor agonists are compounds that bind to and activate adenosine receptors in the body.\n\n2. \"dose-dependent\" - This is not a chemical entity. It describes the relationship between the effects and the dosage of the adenosine receptor agonists but does not refer to a specific chemical.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"adenosine receptor agonists.\""},

Based on your request, let's remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Chemical\" from the paragraph.\n\nParagraph: All adenosine receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice, and the effects were dose-dependent.\n\nIn this case, the only entity that clearly refers to a \"Chemical\" is \"adenosine receptor agonists.\" The phrase \"locomotor activity\" does not refer to a chemical entity, and \"dose-dependent\" describes the relationship between the effects and the dosage but does not specifically refer to a chemical.
