Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"Liver transplantation\" - This is not a chemical entity but a medical procedure involving the transplantation of a liver from a donor to a recipient.\n\n2. \"fulminant liver failure\" - This is a medical condition characterized by rapid and severe liver dysfunction. It does not refer to a specific chemical entity but rather a condition affecting the liver.\n\n3. \"intraoperative\" - This term refers to activities or events that occur during a surgical procedure. It does not refer to a specific chemical entity.\n\n4. \"postoperative\" - This term refers to activities or events that occur after a surgical procedure. It does not refer to a specific chemical entity.\n\nIn summary, there are no specific chemical entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
