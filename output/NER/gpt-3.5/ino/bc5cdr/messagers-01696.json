Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify any chemical entities mentioned.\n\nStep 1: Identify potential chemical entities\nIn this paragraph, there doesn't seem to be any specific chemical entities mentioned. However, there is a mention of a \"drug-induced complication,\" which implies the involvement of a drug. We can consider \"drug\" as a potential chemical entity.\n\nStep 2: Finalize identified chemical entities\nBased on the analysis, the identified chemical entity in the paragraph is \"drug.\"\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the given paragraph, and there may be other chemical entities mentioned in a different context or surrounding text."},
