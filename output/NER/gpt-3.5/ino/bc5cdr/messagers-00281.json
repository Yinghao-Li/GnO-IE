Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. dl-sotalol: This is a medication used to treat certain heart rhythm disorders, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. It can be associated with the risk of inducing early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are abnormal electrical impulses in the heart.\n\n2. azimilide: This is another medication used to treat certain heart rhythm disorders, such as atrial fibrillation. Similar to dl-sotalol, it can also be associated with the risk of inducing EADs.\n\n3. QT prolongation: This is not a specific disease, but rather a condition where the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is longer than normal. It can be caused by certain medications, including dl-sotalol and azimilide, and can increase the risk of arrhythmias.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are dl-sotalol, azimilide, and QT prolongation."},
