Based on your request, let's remove entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" from the paragraph:\n\n\"After the end of fenoterol - hydrobromide infusion, tremor amplitudes decreased significantly faster than those following ritodrin - HCl infusion.\"\n\nIn this revised version, the entities that do not clearly refer to \"Disease\" are:\n\n1. Fenoterol - hydrobromide infusion: This refers to the administration of a medication, not a disease.\n2. Ritodrin - HCl infusion: This also refers to the administration of a medication, not a disease.\n\nThe remaining part of the sentence is \"tremor amplitudes decreased significantly faster.\" While \"tremor\" is not a specific disease entity, it can be a symptom of various underlying conditions. Therefore, it can be considered as a potential disease-related entity.\n\nSo, based on the revised paragraph, the potential disease-related entity mentioned is \"tremor.\""},
