Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"Population spikes (PS)\": In this context, \"PS\" refers to population spikes, which are a type of electrophysiological response in the brain. While not explicitly stated, it is likely that the term \"population spikes\" refers to a chemical process involving neurotransmitters.\n\n2. \"LPP\": LPP stands for Late Positive Potential, which is an event-related potential (ERP) component in the brain. Similar to the previous mention, LPP is likely associated with chemical processes involving neurotransmitters.\n\n3. \"DG region\": DG stands for dentate gyrus, which is a region in the hippocampus of the brain. While not explicitly stated, the DG region is known to be involved in various chemical processes related to learning and memory.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are likely neurotransmitters and other chemicals involved in the population spikes, LPP, and the DG region."},
