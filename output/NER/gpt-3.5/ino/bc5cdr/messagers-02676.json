Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\nStep 1: Identify potential chemical entities\nIn this paragraph, there is no direct mention of any chemical entities. However, there is a mention of \"TAC level,\" which could potentially refer to a chemical entity.\n\nStep 2: Determine if \"TAC level\" refers to a chemical entity\nTo determine if \"TAC level\" refers to a chemical entity, we need more context. Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning of \"TAC level.\" It could potentially refer to a chemical compound or a medical measurement.\n\nBased on the given information, we can only identify \"TAC level\" as a potential chemical entity."},
