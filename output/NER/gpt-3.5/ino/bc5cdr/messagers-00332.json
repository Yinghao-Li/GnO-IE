Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"superoxide dismutase\" - This is a chemical entity, specifically an enzyme that helps in the breakdown of superoxide radicals.\n\n2. \"oxidant stress\" - This is not a specific chemical entity, but it refers to a condition where there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify them.\n\n3. \"aminoglycoside\" - This is a class of antibiotics that includes drugs like gentamicin and streptomycin. Aminoglycosides are known to cause ototoxicity, which is damage to the inner ear leading to hearing loss or balance problems.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"superoxide dismutase\" and \"aminoglycoside\"."},
