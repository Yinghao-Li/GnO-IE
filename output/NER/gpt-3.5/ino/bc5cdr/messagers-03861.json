It is a chemical compound mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n2. APAP nephrotoxicity - APAP stands for Acetaminophen, which is a medication commonly used to relieve pain and reduce fever. Nephrotoxicity refers to the toxic effects on the kidneys. So, APAP nephrotoxicity refers to the kidney damage caused by Acetaminophen.\n\n3. PAP nephrotoxicity - PAP stands for para-aminophenol, which is a metabolite of Acetaminophen. Similar to APAP nephrotoxicity, PAP nephrotoxicity refers to the kidney damage caused by para-aminophenol.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are APAP nephrotoxicity and PAP nephrotoxicity."},
