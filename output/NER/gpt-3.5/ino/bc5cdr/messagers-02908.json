Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"renal replacement therapy\" - This is a medical treatment that involves the use of a machine to filter waste products and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys are not functioning properly. While it does involve the use of chemicals, it is not a specific chemical entity.\n\n2. \"tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)\" - This is a medical condition that occurs when cancer cells release their contents into the bloodstream, leading to an imbalance of chemicals in the body.
