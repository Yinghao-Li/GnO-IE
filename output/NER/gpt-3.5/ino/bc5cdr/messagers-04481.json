CYP (Cytochrome P450): This is not directly related to a specific disease. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in drug metabolism and can be associated with drug-induced liver injury or drug-drug interactions, which can lead to adverse effects or diseases.\n\n2.

The DRG is a cluster of nerve cell bodies located near the spinal cord.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
