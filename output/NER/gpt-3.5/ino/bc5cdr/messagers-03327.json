The paragraph primarily discusses a medical case involving a woman who developed a condition after receiving a steroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. While the term \"steroid\" is mentioned, it does not refer to a specific chemical compound. Therefore, there are no clear \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
