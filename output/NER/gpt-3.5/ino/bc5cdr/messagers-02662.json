DNA damage: While not a specific disease, DNA damage can be associated with various diseases, such as cancer.\n4. Strand breaks (SBs): Strand breaks in DNA can be caused by diseases or other factors.\n5. Oxidized pyrimidines: Oxidative damage to pyrimidines in DNA can be associated with diseases.\n6.
