Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor: This is not explicitly mentioned as a separate entity in the paragraph, but it is mentioned as a property of galantamine. It is a type of chemical that inhibits the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.\n\n3. Nicotinic receptor modulator: This is also not explicitly mentioned as a separate entity in the paragraph, but it is mentioned as a property of galantamine. It is a type of chemical that modulates the activity of nicotinic receptors.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are galantamine, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and nicotinic receptor modulator."},
