Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"contralateral motor control\": This phrase does not mention any specific chemical entities. It refers to a type of motor control where one side of the body is controlled by the opposite hemisphere of the brain. It does not involve any specific chemicals.\n\n2. \"cerebral hemisphere\": This phrase refers to the two halves of the brain, the left and right hemispheres.
