Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma: This is a medical condition characterized by high blood sugar levels and dehydration. While there are no specific chemical entities mentioned here, it is related to the imbalance of glucose and electrolytes in the body.\n\n2. Lithium: This is a chemical element (Li) commonly used as a medication for bipolar disorder. It is mentioned as a potential cause of the condition described in the paragraph.\n\n3. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: This is a condition where the kidneys are unable to properly concentrate urine, leading to excessive thirst and urination. While it is not directly mentioned as a chemical entity, it is related to the dysfunction of the kidneys.\n\nIn summary, the chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is lithium."},
