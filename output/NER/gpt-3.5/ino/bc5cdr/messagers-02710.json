STZ treated rat: This refers to a rat that has been treated with STZ, which stands for streptozotocin. STZ is commonly used to induce diabetes in animal models. Therefore, the disease entity mentioned here is diabetes.\n\n2. Apoptotic cell death: This refers to a type of cell death called apoptosis. While not a specific disease, apoptosis can be associated with various diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders or cancer.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are diabetes and potentially other diseases associated with apoptotic cell death."},
