Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"hepatitis B e antigen\" - This is a chemical entity related to the hepatitis B virus.\n\n2. \"aminotransferase levels\" - Aminotransferase is a group of enzymes that are involved in various metabolic processes. In this context, it refers to the levels of these enzymes in the body.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"hepatitis B e antigen\" and \"aminotransferase levels\"."},
