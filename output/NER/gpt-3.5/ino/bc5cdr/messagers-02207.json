It is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders.\n\n2. Prolactin (PRL) - This is another chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that plays a role in lactation and reproductive function.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are Verapamil and Prolactin (PRL)."},
