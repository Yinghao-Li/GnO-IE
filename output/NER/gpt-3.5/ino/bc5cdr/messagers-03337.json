Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"complex I\": This refers to a specific complex, likely a protein complex involved in cellular respiration. It is a chemical entity.\n\n2. \"aconitase\": This refers to an enzyme called aconitase, which is involved in the citric acid cycle. It is also a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"complex I\" and \"aconitase\"."},
