Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"Myocardial marker enzymes\" - This phrase refers to enzymes that are specific to the heart muscle (myocardium). While it does not explicitly mention a specific disease, it suggests that there may be a disease or condition affecting the heart.\n\n2. \"Serum\" - Serum refers to the clear, yellowish fluid that remains after blood has clotted. While it is not a disease itself, changes in the activity of enzymes in serum can be indicative of certain diseases or conditions.\n\nBased on the paragraph, there is no specific disease mentioned, but it suggests that there may be a disease or condition affecting the heart."},

While it is not a specific chemical entity, it is related to the measurement of the enzymes' function.\n\n3. \"Serum\": This term refers to the liquid component of blood after the blood cells have been removed. While it is not a specific chemical entity, it is a biological fluid that may contain various chemical substances.\n\nBased on the paragraph, the identified chemical entities are \"myocardial marker enzymes\" and \"serum\"."},
