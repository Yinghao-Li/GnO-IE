However, there are mentions of medical terms such as \"clonidine\" and \"saline vehicle.\" Clonidine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure. While it is not a disease itself, it is used to manage the symptoms of certain conditions. Therefore, we can consider \"clonidine\" as a related entity to diseases. However, \"saline vehicle\" does not refer to a disease and can be excluded from the list of disease entities."},
