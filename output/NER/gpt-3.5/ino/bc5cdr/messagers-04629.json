Let's identify the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph step by step.\n\n1. \"hyperprolactinemia\" - This is a medical condition characterized by high levels of the hormone prolactin. While it is not explicitly mentioned as a chemical entity, it is related to the hormone prolactin.\n\n2. \"dopamine (DA)\" - Dopamine is a chemical neurotransmitter in the brain. In this context, it is mentioned as \"DA\" which is an abbreviation for dopamine.\n\n3. \"median eminence (ME)\" - The median eminence is a part of the hypothalamus in the brain. While it is not a chemical entity, it is mentioned in relation to the dopamine concentrations.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"hyperprolactinemia\" and \"dopamine (DA)\"."},
