Let's break down the paragraph and identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale\" - This is not a chemical entity but a rating scale used to assess the severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms.

It does not refer to any specific chemical.\n\n3. \"England activities of daily living score\" - Again, this is not a chemical entity but a scoring system used to assess the functional abilities of individuals.
