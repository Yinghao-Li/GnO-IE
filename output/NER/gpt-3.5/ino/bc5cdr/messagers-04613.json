ECG (Electrocardiogram) - This is a chemical entity that stands for Electrocardiogram, a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart.\n\n2.

QT interval - This is a chemical entity that refers to the time interval between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave on an ECG.\n\n4. QTc interval - This is a chemical entity that refers to the corrected QT interval, which is the QT interval adjusted for heart rate.\n\n5.
