It refers to the activity level of the enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in the serum.\n\n2. E - I animals: This does not refer to a specific disease. It likely refers to a group of animals that were subjected to a specific experimental condition.\n\n3. S - I and EC groups: These do not refer to specific diseases either. They likely refer to other groups of animals in the experiment.\n\n4. Isoproterenol injection: Isoproterenol is a medication that can be used to treat certain heart conditions, but in this context, it is not specifically mentioned as a disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
