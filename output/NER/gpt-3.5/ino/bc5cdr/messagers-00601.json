Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify any chemical entities mentioned.\n\nStep 1: Identify potential chemical entities\nIn this paragraph, there doesn't seem to be any specific chemical entities mentioned. The focus is on apnea, seizures, and respiratory changes, which are not directly related to chemicals.\n\nStep 2: Confirm the absence of chemical entities\nUpon closer examination, there are no chemical names or references to specific chemicals in the paragraph. The terms mentioned are related to medical conditions and physiological changes rather than chemical substances.\n\nTherefore, there are no chemical entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
