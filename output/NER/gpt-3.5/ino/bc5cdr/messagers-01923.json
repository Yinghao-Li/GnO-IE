Coronary computerized tomography angiography: This is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the coronary arteries. While it is not a disease itself, it is a diagnostic procedure used to detect or rule out diseases related to the coronary arteries, such as coronary artery disease.\n\n2. Chest pain: Chest pain can be a symptom of various diseases, including heart-related conditions like angina or a heart attack. In this context, it is mentioned as a symptom associated with cocaine use.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are coronary artery disease and potentially other heart-related conditions associated with chest pain."},
