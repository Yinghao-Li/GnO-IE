It is not a specific disease, but a symptom.\n4. Laboratory values: Not a disease entity, but refers to the results of various tests that can indicate the presence or progression of a disease.\n5. Electrocardiograms: Not a disease entity, but a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart.\n6. Vital signs: Not a disease entity, but refers to measurements such as heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature that can indicate the overall health of an individual.\n7.
