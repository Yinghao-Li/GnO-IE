Fatty acid oxidation: This is a metabolic process that occurs in the body. It is not a disease entity.\n\n4. Lipoprotein assembly: This refers to the process of assembling lipoproteins, which are particles involved in lipid transport. It is not a disease entity.\n\n5. Lipid transport: This refers to the movement of lipids (fats) in the body. It is not a disease entity.\n\nBased on the paragraph, there are no specific disease entities mentioned.
