IL-2: IL-2 refers to Interleukin-2, which is also a cytokine involved in the immune response. It is not specifically mentioned as a disease in the paragraph.\n\n3. TNF: TNF refers to Tumor Necrosis Factor, which is a cytokine involved in inflammation and immune response. It is not specifically mentioned as a disease in the paragraph.\n\n4. PAF: PAF refers to Platelet-Activating Factor, which is a lipid mediator involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation.
