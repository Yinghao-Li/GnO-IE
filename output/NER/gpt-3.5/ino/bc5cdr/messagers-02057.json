CCR2: This is a chemokine receptor, which is a type of protein involved in cell signaling.

The term \"CCR2 positive cells\" refers to cells expressing the CCR2 protein, which is a receptor involved in cell signaling. However, it is not a chemical entity itself. The term \"hippocampus\" refers to a brain region and is not a chemical entity either. Therefore, there are no chemical entities mentioned in this paragraph."},
