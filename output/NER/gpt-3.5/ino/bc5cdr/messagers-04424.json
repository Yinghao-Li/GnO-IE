Chronic doxorubicin administration: This phrase does not specifically mention a disease. However, doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, so it is often associated with cancer-related diseases.\n\n2. ECG: ECG stands for electrocardiogram, which is a test used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. It is not a disease but a diagnostic tool.\n\n3. ICRF - 187: ICRF-187 is not a disease but a protective agent. It is a drug that is sometimes used to prevent or reduce the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin, which can cause heart-related complications.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
