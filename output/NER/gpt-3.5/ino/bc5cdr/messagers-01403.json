Vincristine: Vincristine is a medication used in the treatment of various types of cancer, including leukemia and lymphoma. It is not a disease itself but is used to treat diseases.\n\n2. Dexamethasone: Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid medication used to treat a wide range of conditions, including inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases, and certain types of cancer. Again, it is not a disease itself but is used to treat diseases.\n\n3. Polyethylene glycol-asparaginase: Polyethylene glycol-asparaginase is a medication used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is an enzyme that helps to kill cancer cells by depriving them of a necessary amino acid. Like the previous two, it is not a disease itself but is used to treat a disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific disease entities mentioned in the paragraph. The paragraph mainly mentions medications used in the treatment of diseases."},
