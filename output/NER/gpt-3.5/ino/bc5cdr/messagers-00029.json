Quinine: This is a chemical compound used as an antimalarial drug and a bitter flavoring agent. It is mentioned in the context of \"quinine-sensitive\" K(+) channels.\n\n2. 4-aminopyridine: This is a chemical compound used as a medication to treat certain neurological conditions. It is mentioned in the context of \"4-aminopyridine-sensitive\" K(+) channels.\n\n3. K(+): This refers to potassium ions, which are positively charged atoms of the element potassium. It is mentioned in the context of K(+) channels, which are ion channels that allow the passage of potassium ions.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are quinine and 4-aminopyridine."},
