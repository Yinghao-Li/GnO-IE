Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n1. creatine kinase (CK) - CK is an enzyme that is often used as a marker for muscle damage. While it is not a disease itself, elevated levels of CK can indicate certain conditions such as muscle injury or heart attack.\n\n2. CK-MB - CK-MB is a specific form of creatine kinase that is found primarily in the heart muscle. Elevated levels of CK-MB can indicate damage to the heart, such as a heart attack.\n\n3. cardiac troponin I (cTnI) - cTnI is a protein that is released into the bloodstream when there is damage to the heart muscle. Elevated levels of cTnI can indicate a heart attack or other cardiac conditions.\n\nIn this paragraph, the mentioned entities are not diseases themselves, but rather markers or indicators of certain conditions or diseases related to the heart."},
