Trazodone: Trazodone is a medication used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. It is not a disease.\n\n2. 5-HT 2C receptors: 5-HT 2C receptors are a type of serotonin receptor. They are not a disease.\n\n3. Nigrostriatal DAergic neurons: Nigrostriatal DAergic neurons are dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. They are not a disease.\n\n4. 5-HT: 5-HT refers to serotonin, a neurotransmitter. It is not a disease.\n\n5. Dexamphetamine stereotypy: Dexamphetamine stereotypy refers to a specific behavioral response to dexamphetamine, a medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is not a disease.\n\n6. Haloperidol catalepsy: Haloperidol catalepsy refers to a specific side effect of haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication. It is not a disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
