Temsirolimus: This is a drug used in the treatment of certain types of cancer, so it can be considered as a disease entity.\n\n2. Tumor: This refers to an abnormal growth of cells, often associated with cancer.\n\n3. Microvessel density: This refers to the number of blood vessels in a small area of tissue, which can be indicative of diseases such as cancer.\n\n4. VEGF expression: VEGF stands for vascular endothelial growth factor, which is a protein involved in the formation of blood vessels. Abnormal VEGF expression can be associated with diseases such as cancer.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are temsirolimus, tumor, microvessel density, and VEGF expression."},
