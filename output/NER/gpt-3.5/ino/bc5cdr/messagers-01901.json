Flecainide toxicity: This refers to the potential harmful effects or adverse reactions that can occur when taking flecainide, a medication used to treat certain heart rhythm disorders.\n\n2. CYP2D6 inhibitors: While not a disease itself, CYP2D6 inhibitors are medications or substances that inhibit the activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing flecainide and other drugs. Inhibition of CYP2D6 can lead to increased levels of flecainide in the blood, potentially causing toxicity.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are flecainide toxicity."},
