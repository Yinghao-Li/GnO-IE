Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"central cholinergic systems\": This phrase refers to a specific system in the central nervous system that involves the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Therefore, \"cholinergic\" is the chemical entity mentioned here.\n\n2. \"dopaminergic systems\": This phrase refers to a specific system in the brain that involves the neurotransmitter dopamine. Therefore, \"dopaminergic\" is the chemical entity mentioned here.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"cholinergic\" and \"dopaminergic\"."},
