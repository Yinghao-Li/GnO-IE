Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"GFC effects\": In this phrase, \"GFC\" is mentioned, which could potentially be a chemical entity. However, without further context or information, it is difficult to determine what \"GFC\" refers to. It could be an abbreviation or acronym for a specific chemical compound or substance.\n\n2. \"central nervous system\": This phrase refers to a biological system rather than a specific chemical entity. It is the part of the nervous system that includes the brain and spinal cord.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there is no specific chemical entity mentioned other than the unidentified \"GFC.\""},
