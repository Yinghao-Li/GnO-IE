    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. \"manic-like adverse effects\" - This phrase refers to a set of symptoms or conditions that resemble mania, which is a mental health disorder. Therefore, \"manic-like adverse effects\" can be considered a disease entity.\n\n2. \"psychomotor stimulants\" - This term refers to a class of drugs that stimulate the central nervous system, such as amphetamines. While not explicitly mentioned as a disease, the use of psychomotor stimulants can lead to various health issues, including addiction and mental health disorders.\n\n3. \"sympathomimetic agents\" - This term refers to drugs that mimic the effects of the sympathetic nervous system, which controls the body's \"fight or flight\" response. Similar to psychomotor stimulants, the use of sympathomimetic agents can have various health implications, including cardiovascular problems and mental health disorders.\n\nIn summary, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"manic-like adverse effects\" and the potential health issues associated with the use of psychomotor stimulants and sympathomimetic agents."},
