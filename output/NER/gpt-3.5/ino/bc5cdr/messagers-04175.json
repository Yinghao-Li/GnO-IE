Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned.\n\n1. \"Endothelial changes\" - This phrase refers to changes that occur in the endothelium, which is the inner lining of blood vessels.

It does not directly mention a chemical entity.\n\n3. \"previous paper\" - This phrase refers to a previously published scientific paper.
