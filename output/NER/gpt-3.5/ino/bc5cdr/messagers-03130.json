Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the chemical entities mentioned.\n\nStep 1: Read the paragraph and identify potential chemical entities.\n\nIn the given paragraph, there is one potential chemical entity mentioned: 131I.\n\nStep 2: Confirm if the identified entity is a chemical entity.\n\n131I is indeed a chemical entity. It refers to iodine-131, which is a radioactive isotope of iodine commonly used in medical treatments, including the therapy of hyperthyroidism.\n\nSo, the chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is 131I (iodine-131)."},
