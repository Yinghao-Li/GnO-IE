While it is not explicitly mentioned as a disease in the paragraph, it is relevant to the context as it is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its potential to cause congenital abnormalities.\n\n2. Congenital abnormalities: Congenital abnormalities refer to structural or functional abnormalities that are present at birth. While it is a broad term and not a specific disease, it is mentioned in relation to the potential effects of isotretinoin on the fetus.\n\n3. Microphthalmos: Microphthalmos is a rare eye condition characterized by abnormally small eyeballs. It is mentioned as one of the reported congenital abnormalities associated with maternal use of isotretinoin.\n\n4. Orbital hypertelorism: Orbital hypertelorism is a condition characterized by an increased distance between the eyes. It is mentioned as one of the reported congenital abnormalities associated with maternal use of isotretinoin.\n\n5. Optic nerve hypoplasia: Optic nerve hypoplasia is a condition where the optic nerve is underdeveloped. It is mentioned as one of the reported congenital abnormalities associated with maternal use of isotretinoin.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are microphthalmos, orbital hypertelorism, and optic nerve hypoplasia."},
