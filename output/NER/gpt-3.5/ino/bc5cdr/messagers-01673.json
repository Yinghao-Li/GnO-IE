Rash: Rash can be a symptom of various underlying conditions, including infectious diseases, allergic reactions, autoimmune disorders, and others. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity.\n2. Peripheral neuropathy: Peripheral neuropathy refers to damage or dysfunction of the peripheral nerves, which can be caused by various diseases, such as diabetes, infections, autoimmune disorders, and others. Therefore, it can also be considered a disease entity.\n\nSo, the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"rash\" and \"peripheral neuropathy\"."},
