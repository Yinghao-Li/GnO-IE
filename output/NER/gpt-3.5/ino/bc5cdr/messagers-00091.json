Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned:\n\n1. \"Dobutamine induced ischaemia\" - This phrase refers to a specific type of induced ischemia, which is a condition where there is reduced blood flow to a part of the body. In this case, it is induced by the drug dobutamine.\n\n2. \"coronary artery disease\" - This is a specific disease that affects the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. It is characterized by the narrowing or blockage of these arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"dobutamine induced ischaemia\" and \"coronary artery disease\"."},

Dobutamine: This is a chemical compound, specifically a medication that is used to stimulate the heart and improve blood flow in certain conditions.\n\n2. Ischaemia: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition where there is an inadequate blood supply to a part of the body, often due to a blockage in the arteries.\n\n3. Pathophysiology: This is not a chemical entity either, but rather a branch of physiology that deals with the functional changes that occur in the body as a result of disease or injury.\n\n4. Coronary artery disease: This is a medical condition where the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked, usually due to the buildup of plaque.\n\nSo, in this paragraph, the only chemical entity mentioned is \"Dobutamine.\""},
