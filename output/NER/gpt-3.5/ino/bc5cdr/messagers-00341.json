Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n1. \"depression of output of triglyceride\" - This phrase does not specifically mention a disease. It refers to a decrease in the production of triglyceride, which is a type of fat found in the blood.\n\n2. \"tetracycline\" - Tetracycline is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections. It is not a disease itself but a medication used to treat diseases caused by bacteria.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
