Orthotropic liver transplantation: This is a surgical procedure where a diseased liver is replaced with a healthy liver from a donor. While it is not a disease itself, it is a treatment for end-stage liver disease.\n\n3. Neuro-ophthalmologic examinations: Neuro-ophthalmology is a medical specialty that deals with visual problems related to the nervous system. While it is not a specific disease, it involves the evaluation and diagnosis of various neurological and ophthalmologic conditions.\n\n4. Laboratory studies: This is a general term that refers to various tests and analyses performed in a laboratory setting.
