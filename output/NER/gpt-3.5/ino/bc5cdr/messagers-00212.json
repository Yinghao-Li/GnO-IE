It is a type of urinary incontinence that occurs when there is stress or pressure on the bladder, leading to involuntary urine leakage.\n\n2. Piloerection: This is not a disease entity but a physiological response. Piloerection refers to the involuntary erection or raising of hairs on the skin, often caused by cold temperatures, fear, or emotional arousal.\n\n3. Cardiovascular side effects: This is not a specific disease entity but refers to potential adverse effects on the cardiovascular system that can occur as a result of using certain medications or treatments. It is a general term used to describe various cardiovascular-related complications or symptoms that may arise.\n\nSo, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is stress incontinence."},
