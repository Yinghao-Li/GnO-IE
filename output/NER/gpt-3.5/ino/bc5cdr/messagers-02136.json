Let's identify the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. antithrombotic - This is a chemical entity that refers to medications used to prevent the formation of blood clots.\n2. ICH - This is an abbreviation for intracerebral hemorrhage, which is a type of stroke caused by bleeding within the brain.\n3. IS - This is an abbreviation for ischemic stroke, which is a type of stroke caused by a blockage in a blood vessel supplying the brain.\n4. TIA - This is an abbreviation for transient ischemic attack, which is a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain that can cause stroke-like symptoms.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph are antithrombotic, ICH, IS, and TIA."},
