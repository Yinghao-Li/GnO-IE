The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the resulting polymers , PBT and PTT , were substantially stabilized when compared to those of the parent P3HT. Such energy level lowering was attributed to the integration of carboxylate and vinylene groups giving rise to a push - pull structural motif , resulting in an enhanced PCE of the PV devices based on them. 21 Over the years , the use of the structural effect to enhance PSC performance has been extensively investigated , particularly the donor - acceptor ( D-A ) strategy , which has been proved to be an effective approach to develop donor polymers with wide absorption , low - lying energy levels , and enhanced electron properties. 23-32 Besides , conjugation expansion on the polymer backbone is an alternative tool to improve the electronic properties of polymers. By replacing a branched 2ethylhexyl side chain with a linear n-octyl group , Zhang and his co-workers synthesized a PTB7-Th derivative namely , PBTT. PV cells based on PBTT : IEICO showed a superior device performance than that of the PTB7-Th - based device with a PCE of 9.5% , a V oc of 0.86 V , a J sc of 17.9 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 61.3% . Such dramatic enhancement in efficiency was attributed to a higher charge mobility and improved morphology of the PBTT : IEICO blend film induced by the less steric hindered linear alkyl side chain. 1 Yang and coworkers used selenophene to replace thiophene π-bridge in the indacenodithiophene (IDT)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD)-based copolymer ( PThBDDIDT ) to develop a donor-π-acceptor type copolymer , PSeBDDIDT. The PCE of solar cells based on polymer : PC71BM as an active layer was dramatically increased from 7.04 to 8.65% , respectively. Such improvement could result from stronger intermolecular interactions , expanded absorption range , and better molecular planarity of selenophene contained PSeBDDIDT. 33 Random terpolymers comprised of thieno[2′,3′ : 5′,6′]pyrido [ 3,4- g]- thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione , thiophene( T ) , and dithiophene ( 2T ) were synthesized by Yang and co-workers in which the crystallinity of terpolymers could be controlled by varying the compositions of T and 2T. The PSC based on a terpolymer with the optimized T / 2T ratio of 7 : 3 showed a high J sc of 18.3 mA cm^-2 and a FF of 71.2% , thus resulting in an enhanced PCE up to 10.8% . 34 Fluorination on polymer backbones has also been widely adopted to tune and improve the functional properties of donor polymers such as stabilization of their energy levels and hence positively impacting on PSC performance.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
