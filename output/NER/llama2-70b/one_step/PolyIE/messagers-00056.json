The combination of the different electron - deficient units of pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) and thieno [ 3,4- c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) can be ideal for producing broad light absorption due to the large difference between their electron - withdrawing strengths. 19,22 In addition , both units have been successfully used in D-A copolymers to produce high - performance PSCs. 26-33 While electron - withdrawing TPD possesses a relatively simple , symmetric , and planar structure suitable for D-A copolymers in PSCs , DPP exhibits very strong electron - withdrawing effect due to the presence of electrondeficient lactam rings and strong π-π interactions. 19,34 Herein , we report a series of novel random poly[thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione]copolymers ( PBDTT- DPP - TPD ) based on one electron - rich unit , thienylsubstituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDTT ) , and two electron - deficient units , DPP and TPD , that have complementary and broad light absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm. This is a much broader absorption than other reported random terpolymers , 23,24 endowing a great potential for improving the PSC performance and providing an ideal system for studying the compositional effect of the random terpolymers on the PSC performance. While the ratio of DPP to TPD influenced the optical behavior of the random terpolymers , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymers showed a nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6% . The best PCE value of 6.33% was obtained from the blend device of PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 and [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) , with a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) higher than 16 mA / cm^2. To understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the PCE , the optical , electrical , and structural properties of these random terpolymers with different ratios of DPP to TPD were systematically investigated. stated , all of the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received . The weight - average molecular weight ( M w ) , number - average molecular weight ( M n ) , and polydispersity index ( PDI ) of P1- P7 were measured by SEC with o-dichlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 ° C. The characteristics of the polymers are summarized in Table 1. To determine the actual ratio between DPP and TPD in the random terpolymers , they were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The 1H NMR spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure S1.
