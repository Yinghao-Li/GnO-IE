Linear plot of I ds 1 / 2 vs V gs deduced from the I ds vs V gs measurement.

The summary of the performances is provided in Table 1. I ds = ( W / 2L ) × μ × C i ( V gs - V th ) The OFET device using as-cast PCDTBT films without thermal annealing exhibits a hole mobility of 2.2 × 10^-4 cm^2 / V°s with an on / off current ratio ( I on / I off ) of 4.44 × 10^3 . For PCDTBT thin films after annealing at evaluated temperatures , the mobilities are not markedly improved , implying that the PCDTBT thin films remain nearly amorphous for both as-cast and annealing at high temperature. On the other hand , it is found that the unannealed thin films of PCDSeBT exhibit a slightly higher mobility of μ h = 5.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 / V°s , compared with that of pristine PCDTBT. Interestingly , in contrast , as the PCDSeBT thin films are annealed at a temperature of 120 and 150 °C , the mobilities are systematically improved up to 1.0 × 10^-3 cm^2 / V°s ( Figure 2b ) , which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of PCDTBT , possibly due to increased interpolymer chain contact induced by Se°°°Se interactions with the thermal annealing process. To gain a better understanding of the influence of the thermal annealing , the crystallinity and molecular organization of PCDTBT and PCDSeBT thin films were investigated by Xray diffraction ( XRD ) , both before and after annealing at 150 °C . Both the as-cast and annealed PCDTBT thin films fail to reveal any defined scattering patterns ( Figure 3a ) , indicating the macroscopically disordered , amorphous structure. In the case of PCDSeBT , the as-cast thin films show very weak diffractions ( Figure 3b ). Upon thermal annealing , the primary peak at 4.42 ° , corresponding to a d-spacing of 19.99 Å , progressively intensifies and the secondary broad peak at ∼ 21.1 ° ( d = 4.21 Å ) that is probably related to π-π stacking becomes visible ( Figure 3b ). On the basis of these XRD results , we can conclude that the oriented microstructure of the as-cast PCDSeBT thin films is kinetically limited but the polymer chains reorganize to ordered lamellar packing structures upon annealing. This observation is a plausible explanation for the sudden rise in mobility of PCDSeBT as a function of the thermal annealing.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
