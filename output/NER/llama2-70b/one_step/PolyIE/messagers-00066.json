The stronger ICT within PzNDTDTBO is originated from a relatively stronger electron - withdrawing nature of BO unit compared to that of the BT one. In films , the absorption spectra of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are similar to those in solution , with obvious red - shifts ( 56-68 nm ) of their absorption maxima as shown in Figure 3b , which is a common phenomenon for conjugated polymers , owing to the aggregation of the conjugated polymer main chains in the solid films. In addition , both PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO display prominent vibronic shoulders at shorter wavelengths , implying an ordered arrangement in their solid films , with strong π-π stacking between the polymeric backbonesa feature that also appears in the spectra of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , which is beneficial to improve the charge mobility of resulting films. 21 The absorption edges for solid films of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are 703 and 704 nm , respectively , corresponding to nearly the same optical band gap ( E g opt ) of 1.76 eV. Compared with the reported copolymer PzNDTTPD , 14 both PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO show broader absorption spectra and smaller bandgaps , which can be attributed to the stronger electron - accepting ability of the BT / BO unit in the copolymer , and this is beneficial to increase the light - harvesting capacity for higher short - circuit current density ( J sc ). 2d Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry has been employed and considered as an effective tool in investigating electrochemical properties of conjugated organic molecules and polymers. 22 From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammogram , energy levels of HOMO and LUMO can be readily estimated , which correspond to ionization potential ( IP ) and electron affinity ( EA ) , respectively. Cyclic voltammogram of the polymer films are shown in Figure 4. The onset oxidation potential ( E ox ) / onset reduction potential ( E red ) of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are 0.75 / -0.97 and 0.90 / -1.02 V vs Ag / AgCl , respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer were The HOMO , LUMO , and electrochemical bandgaps ( E g ec ) of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO , calculated from the value of E ox and E red of the polymers , are -5.15 / -3.43 / 1.71 and -5.30 / -3.38 / 1.92 eV , respectively ( see Table 2 ). For the convenience of comparison , the optical and electrochemical parameters of the PzNDTTPD are also given in Table 2. The electrochemical band gaps of the polymers match well with their optical band gaps within the experimental error.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
