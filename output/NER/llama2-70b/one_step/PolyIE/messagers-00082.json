It is also understood that the 3-fold higher chargecarrier mobility of PTATDPP than that of PTAFDPP arises from its stronger π-π stacking with a shorter d 010 , as discussed above. When the photovoltaic properties of copolymers are measured using PC71BM as an electron acceptor , it is found that the optimum blend ratio of polymer : PC71BM is 1 : 2 to afford the best PCE of both copolymers with the conventional device architecture of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al ( Fig. S2 and Table S1 † ). The best PCE was also achieved when o-dichlorobenzene was used as a solvent and the optimum thickness for the active layer was ca. 90 nm. The current density - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the optimized solar cells are shown in Fig. 4 , and the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Tables 2 and S2. † PTATDPP showed a best PCE of 6.69% ( V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 12.3 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.68 ) , while PTAFDPP showed a best PCE of 5.02% ( V OC = 0.76 V , J SC = 11.2 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.59 ). Both copolymers showed higher V OC s than other DPP - based copolymers due to their low - lying HOMO energy levels. Both copolymers also exhibited high J SC s and FFs , indicating their decent ability for charge generation and transport. Therefore , the TA unit is a promising electron - donating unit for low band - gap copolymers with a low - lying HOMO energy level. When the PSC devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture ( ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag ) in order to further improve the photovoltaic performance , the PCEs of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP - based devices were improved to 7.02% and 5.22% , respectively ( Fig. 4b , Tables 2 and S2 † ) , mainly due to enhanced J SC s ( V OC s and FFs were not changed significantly ). It is noteworthy here that the PCE of over 7% of PTATDPP is the highest efficiency of anthracene - based low band - gap conjugated copolymers. In spite of the same band - gap of the two copolymers , PTATDPP shows slightly higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP ( Fig. S3 † ). This can be ascribed to the closely packed microstructures of PTATDPP and thereby its high charge - carrier mobility than PTAFDPP. When the crystal structures of blend films of the copolymers with PC71BM were examined by XRD , the PTATDPP / PC71BM blend had strong and intense ( 100 ) diffraction while the PTAFDPP / PC71BM blend showed weak and broad ( 100 ) diffraction ( Fig. 2b ).\n\nLet's think step by step."},
