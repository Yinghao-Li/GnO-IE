Article fabrication. The physical properties of PffBB-n polymers are summarized in Table 1. Detailed synthetic procedures and TGA traces could be found in the Supporting Information ( SI ). Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Polymers. The UV - vis absorption spectra of PffBB-n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16 ) measured in chlorobenzene at different temperatures and in thin films are shown in Figure 1. It is clearly demonstrated that PffBB-n exhibits strong temperature - dependent aggregation behavior. In thin films , PffBB-n showed three major absorption bands with the high - energy absorption peaked at ∼ 430 nm and two overlapped and strong absorptions peaked at ∼ 620 and 680 nm. In solution , the first two absorption peaks blue - shift to 380-420 and 520-560 nm , respectively , and the third absorption is highly temperature - dependent which becomes a shoulder peak at high temperature. Therefore , the absorption band located in the high energy region was attributed to π-π* transitions , whereas the broad absorption at around 560 nm corresponded to the intramolecular charge transfer band and the long - wavelength absorption emerged at ∼ 680 nm was due to the polymer interchain stacking aggregation. This aggregation - induced absorption is temperature - sensitive in which the absorption decreases with the increase of temperature , resulting from polymer chain segregation at high temperature. The incorporation of an alkyl side chain can often render a better solubility of a polymer ; however , the long alkyl side chain can exert stronger alkyl-alkyl chain interactions that can give rise to a strong aggregation of polymer chains. As shown in Figure 1 , the aggregation ability / strength of PffBB-n polymers also enhanced with an increase in the size of the alkyl side chains ( from n = 10 to 16 ). Furthermore , this class of polymers exhibited solvent - dependent aggregation behavior in which chloroform and toluene often induced stronger aggregation ; on the other hand , chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene induced moderate aggregation ( Figure S3 ).\n\nLet's think step by step."},
