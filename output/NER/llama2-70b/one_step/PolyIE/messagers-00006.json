Meanwhile , with an increase of the length of the alkyl side chains , the d 2 -spacing of PffBB-n polymers showed a descending trend of 3.84 , 3.82 , 3.77 , and 3.66 Å for PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 , respectively , which indicated that PffBB-n with longer alkyl side chains exhibited enhanced ordered molecular packing. Notably , the longer the alkyl side chain , the closer the polymer aligned through π-π stacking is , which is attributed to the stronger interchain interactions of long alkyl side chains. Such strong πstacking ability and crystalline nature of PffBB-n may provide a highly ordered network for effective electron transport and exciton diffusion. Photovoltaic Properties. Solar cells using PffBB-n as a donor material and PC71BM as the acceptor material were fabricated with an inverted device structure of ITO / ZnO / PffBB-n:PC71BM(1 : 2 w / w ) / MoO 3 / Al. The active blend layer was prepared by means of spin - coating at different temperatures to investigate the impact of coating temperature on photovoltaic device performance , which was characterized under AM 1.5 G simulated solar illumination at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm^-2 . To achieve the high coating temperatures , the high boiling chlorobenzene ( 132 °C ) was used as a solvent even though chloroform is a stronger aggregation - induced solvent. Detailed device fabrication procedures can be found in the electrospray ionisation. The current density - voltage curves of BHJ PSCs fabricated at 60 , 80 , and 100 °C using a 3% CN as the solvent additive and their respective photovoltaic properties are shown in Figure 4 and summarized in Table 3 , respectively. It is important to note that the photovoltaic device performance is greatly affected by the active blend coating temperature. The decyl-substituted PffBB-10 - based device showed a good PCE of 8.22% with a high V oc of 0.93 V , a J sc of 14.62 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 60.44% when the active layer was coated at 80 ° C. On the other hand , PffBB-10 - based devices fabricated at 60 and 100 °C spin - coating temperatures exhibited inferior photovoltaic performance with a lower J sc and a much lower FF of ∼ 56% except for a similar V oc . Furthermore , BHJ PSCs based on PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 also exhibited the same trend in which their highest PCE was achieved by spin - coating the active blend layer at 80 °C .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
