This result suggests that the morphologies of all the active films are very similar , so that such a property will not affect the J sc of the photovoltaic devices.

The short circuit currents of the photovoltaic devices fabricated using the polymers as an electron donor , also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased , which is consistent with the field - effect mobility results of the polymers. We conclude that the introduction of perylene to the conjugated polymer chain enhances the π-π interaction between polymer chains and improves its charge - transport ability , leading to increases short circuit currents in the photovoltaic devices .
