Analogous event has also been realized in D-A type of oligomers and polymers based on 3,4bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene or 2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene as donor and BT as acceptor , which demonstrated that with the depleting composition of BT unit along the conjugated backbone , the dual absorbing bands were induced to move toward the maximum absorption ( λ max ) of the all - donor homopolymer that located in between of the dual absorbance. 52 In solid state , all polymers showed red - shifted absorption spectra compare to their solution absorption ( Figure 2b ) , which could be ascribed to the aggregation of polymer main chain. We realized a slightly bathochromic shift of the PIDT - DTNT absorbance relative to that of the PIDT - EHNT , which was in consistent with the trend realized in solution , while PIDT-C12NT showed a pronounced bathochromic shift of the low energy band absorption with λ max moved from 593 nm in solution to 619 nm as thin film. It was also worth noting that PIDT-C12NT showed much higher absorption coefficient than other two polymers in the whole visible area. Considering that high photo flux of solar spectrum within the region of about 550-700 nm , more intensified absorption of PIDT-C12NT indicated that more sunlight can be harvested that would potentially lead to higher J sc than the other two polymers. The optical band gaps of the polymers are in the range of 1.64 - 1.69 eV as estimated from the absorption onset and the detailed results are summarized in Table 1. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements were carried out to evaluate the molecular frontier orbitals of the resulted polymers. The graphite , platinum wire , and Ag / AgCl were used as the working electrode , counter electrode , and reference electrode , respectively. Polymer films were casted from chlorobenzene solution with concentration of 8 mg mL -1 and all measurements were carried out under inert atmosphere. Figure 3 showed the oxidation of cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films on graphite disk electrode in tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate ( Bu 4 NPF 6 ) solution ( 0.1 M in acetonitrile ) at a scan rate of 50 mV s^-1 .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
