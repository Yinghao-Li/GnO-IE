Because of the threedimensional structure of spirobifluorene units , PSFDTBT is readily dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform , chlorobenzene , toluene , THF , 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) , 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene ( TCB ) , etc. at room temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) showed that PSFDTBT is of good thermal stability with less than 5% weight loss up to 340 ° C. No clear glass transition was observed from 25 to 300 °C in its DSC curves of the second heating and cooling runs ( 20 °C / min ). Optical and Electrochemical Properties. UV - vis absorption spectra of PSFDTBT in THF solution and in film are shown in Figure 1. In THF solution , PSFDTBT exhibited a broad absorption in the range of ultraviolet to visible region with two peaks located at 395 and 527 nm , respectively. In film , the absorption of PSFDTBT became broader and slightly redshifted with two peaks located at 401 and 562 nm , respectively. In comparison with the absorption spectrum in solution , the absorption spectrum in film became broader and red - shifted for about 35 nm , indicating the aggregation or ordered packing of polymer chains in solid state. Ordered packing of polymer chains is beneficial for improving the charge mobility of resulting films. 14 The optical absorption onset of PSFDTBT film is at 629 nm , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.97 eV. PC71BM was chosen as the acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PC61BM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region with a broad peak from 440 to 530 nm , which compensates the absorption valley of the polymer. 15 As shown in Figure 1 , the PSFDTBT / PC71BM blending film ( 1 : 3 by weight ) has a strong absorption over a broad wavelength range of 400^-700 nm. The electrochemical properties of PSFDTBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). The HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT was determined to be -5.40 eV according to the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ) , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential in volts vs Ag / Ag + . 16 Since the open circuit voltage V oc of BHJ PSCs is correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , 5,17 therefore a higher V oc for PSFDTBT based polymer solar cells is anticipated due to the low - lying HOMO energy level.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
