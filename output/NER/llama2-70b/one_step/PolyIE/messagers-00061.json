As more TPD was introduced into the polymer backbone , the domain spacing of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 gradually increased from 19.2 , 20.1 , 21.9 , 22.7 to 24.1 Å , respectively. This is likely due to the increased amount of structurally longer alkyl side chains of TPD. Figure S8 shows that the pristine polymers exhibited a distinctive arc scattering of the ( 010 ) peak along the out - of - plane direction at q = 1.62- 1.68 Å -1 , corresponding to π-π stacking. The π-π stacking is more prominent in the out - of - plane direction , which suggests that most of the polymer backbones are oriented parallel to the substrates. The π-π stacking distances of polymers were 3.85 , 3.86 , 3.84 , 3.85 , and 3.74 Å for P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 , respectively. The combination effects of the DPP to TPD ratio with changes in the alkyl chain could affect the π-π stacking distance of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 and backbone planarity , thus influencing their charge transport properties. The π-π stacking feature of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 in the blended films was significantly changed by the addition of PCBM , as shown in Figure 6. No π-π stacking diffraction was observed in P1 , P3 , and P4 , and only a faint π-π stacking diffraction pattern in the out - of - plane direction appeared for P5. However , P7 had a prominent π-π stacking peak even after the addition of PCBM , indicating that the polymer backbone adopts a preferential \" face-on \" orientation relative to the substrate. In spite of the \" face-on \" orientation of P7 , its mobility was observed to be slightly lower compared to the other polymers , which is most likely due to the presence of fewer percolating pathways for hole transport. 54 Therefore , the GIXS patterns revealed that the incorporation of the different units of DPP and TPD affects the polymeric ordering ( i.e. , domain spacing ) as well as its direction. For further characterization , the BHJ morphology of the polymer blends was investigated by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ). The resulting AFM and TEM images are shown in Figure 7 and Figure S9 , respectively. The images of P1 , P3 , P4 , and P5 blends showed bicontinuous structures of polymer and PCBM as well as small - scale phase separation favorable for exciton dissociation.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
