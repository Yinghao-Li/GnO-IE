The increased J sc of PIDT-C12NT may be also attributed to the enhanced film absorption coefficient so that more sunlight can be absorbed and then generate more excitons , finally produce more charges. It is also worth pointing out that the accuracy of the J sc results was further confirmed by external quantum efficiency ( EQEs ) measurement under illumination of monochromatic light. The EQE spectra are shown in Figure 6b. The calculated current density from the EQE measurement were 4.18 , 7.83 , and 9.72 mA cm^-2 for PIDT - EHNT , PIDT - DTNT , and PIDT-C12NT respectively , which show mismatches with that of determined from current density measurement of three devices in the range of 3-5 % . One can clearly observe the distinctly improved EQE values of polymers by switching the thiophene spacer from the branched 2-ethylhexyl side chain ( PIDT - EHNT ) to linear hexyl side chain ( PIDT - DTNT ) , which was further improved for the bithiophene spacer with linear dodecyl side chain attached on the optimized position ( PIDT-C12NT ) . In conclusion , three donor - acceptor type low band gap conjugated polymers based on indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) and naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) ( NT ) with differ - ent thiophene spacers were synthesized by Stille copolymerization. All polymers showed relatively deep HOMO levels that consequently lead to high open circuit voltage of the solar cell devices. It was shown that the improvement of the processability , backbone planarity , charge carrier mobility and optimal morphology of bulk heterojunction film blended with PC71BM can be achieved by switching the spacer between the IDT and NT units .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
