Make sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 5-13 Careful combinations of donor and acceptor units have yielded low band polymers with a band gap of 1.3 - 1.7 eV , which lead to high PCEs exceeding 7% . 14-17 A variety of good donor moieties , including oligothiophenes , 18-23 carbazole , 24 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene , 25-27 and dithienosilole , 14,28 have been demonstrated as useful for low band gap polymers ; good acceptor moieties including thieno- [3,4-b]thiophenes substituted with electron - withdrawing groups , 29-31 N-alkylthieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione , 25,28 benzothiadiazole , 24,32 and 2,5-bis(2-alkyl)pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione 33-36 have been developed. However , good acceptor moieties enabling polymers to absorb wavelengths over 800 nm remain still rare though acceptor moieties strongly affected to produce a narrow band gap. 37-40 In search of new acceptor moieties , we designed an interesting structure of N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5-azacyclopenta[a]-pentalene-4,6-dione ( DTPD ). The DTPD is a structural combination of thieno [3,4-b]thiophene and N-alkylpyrrole-2,5-dione. The thieno [3,4-b]thiophene is a particularly suitable structure to promote quinoid structures in conjugated polymers. 41-44 However , simple incorporation of the thieno- [3,4-b]thiophene units might increase the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) level of polymers , which causes a significant loss of open - circuit voltages in PSCs. 42 Thus , it is desirable to attach electron - withdrawing groups such as ketone or ester groups and fluorine atoms. 12,15,30 Here we glued the Nalkylpyrrole-2,5-dione , a strong electron - withdrawing unit , 45 to the thieno [3,4-b]thiophene to bring down the HOMO level. Our DFT calculations , indeed , suggested that the DTPD would be a strong electron - withdrawing acceptor moiety ( Figure S1 ). 26,45 Therefore , each fractional unit in the DTPD may exert a synergetic effect to permit strong donor - acceptor electronic delocalization by the quinoid structure and to locate HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) levels of resulting low band gap polymers in a deep state when the DTPD is copolymerized with an appropriate donor moiety. Despite these promising features , to the best of our knowledge , the DTPD moiety has never been utilized to synthesize low band gap polymers for PSCs. Herein , we report synthesis and characterization of two polymers , POBDTPD and PEBDTPD , that consist of DTPD and BDT moieties substituted with octyloxy or 2-ethylhexyloxy g r o u p s , r e s p e c t i v e l y . P O B D T P D : P C 7^0 B M a n d PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blends utilized light absorption up to 900 nm in the generation of photocurrents and showed optimal morphology and efficient exciton separation , yielding PCEs exceeding 5% . This work demonstrates that the newly designed DTPD moiety is a promising building block for high performance PSCs . The thermal properties of the polymers were examined by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ). In the DSC curve , neither polymer displayed a transition up to 300 °C ( Figure S2a,b ).\n\nLet's think step by step."},
