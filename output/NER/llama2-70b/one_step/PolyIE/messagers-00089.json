Make sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 1i Figure 4 shows the J-V ( a ) and J 1 / 2 -V ( b ) characteristics of the PBDT-TDPP-S devices with a hole - only device configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 40 nm ) / active layer ( varied thickness ) / MoO 3 / Al(100 nm ). Although PBDT-TDPP-S contains bulky and rigid side chains , its blend film with PC71BM exhibited a high hole mobility of 3.8 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Moreover , the observed hole mobility is higher than those of the recent reported mainchain D-A polymers , 9 verifying that side - chain D-A polymers can have strong intermolecular orbital overlap and good molecular packing like main - chain D-A polymers. Besides the high hole mobility , the blend also presented high electron mobility in range of 4.4 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( see Figure S7 ). The measured hole and electron mobility are listed in Table 4. Such high and balanced hole - electron mobility for the PBDT-TDPP-S is responsible for the high FF level in the devices. To our best knowledge , the FF is the highest reported to date for side - chain D-A conjugated copolymers The surface morphology of the active layers was studied using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) under tapping mode in order to further understand why the device exhibited better photovoltaic properties at the annealing temperature of 120 ° C. Figure S8 shows typical AFM topography of the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM blend film in unannealed and annealed conditions ( see Supporting Information ). The surface roughness is observed to be 0.773 nm in unannealed condition and 0.602 nm in annealed condition. It indicates that the surface roughness of the blend film can be tuned much smoother by the prethermal annealing. The smooth morphology of the active layer is available for improving the device performance. 10 Therefore , the devices exhibited improved photovoltaic properties by prethermal annealing at an appropriate temperature . In summary , a novel conjugated polymer of PBDT-TDPP-S was successfully obtained , which contains a donor unit of benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene in main chain and an acceptor unit of diketopyrrolopyrrole in side chain. The resultant sidechain D-A polymer exhibited high carrier mobility and outstanding photovoltaic properties in polymer solar cells with a PCE as high as 4.89% . The PCE level is the highest reported to date in the side - chain D-A conjugated copolymersbased single BHJ PSCs , which is twice higher than that of the corresponding main - chain D-A polymer - based ones. Our work presented a new promising side - chain polymeric photovoltaic material for high - performance PSCs .
