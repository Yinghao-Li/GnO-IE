In Figure 6a , microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM , while the polymer formed a small fibril - type domain at a 1 : 1 PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio. As shown in Figure 6c , the fibril domain or microphase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size. It appears that this type of fibril domain occurred because PQCDTB formed effective π-π stacking based on outstanding crystallinity. 31 As shown in Figure 6b , in contrast , when the PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio was 1 : 2 , the polymers were assembled , and a large domain was formed. As a result , a relatively large - size phase separation took place. As shown in Figure 6d , the large domain or the large - size phase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size. The large - phase separation exhibits a low photocurrent by reducing the charge separation and increasing the exciton diffusion length and the recombination of electric charges. 32 Therefore , at a 1 : 2 polymer / PC71BM ratio , a large phase separation occurs between the polymer and the PC71BM. As a result , a low photocurrent would occur ; this is comparable to the 1 : 1 ratio. The same results were confirmed for the current device using the data in Table 3. Similar results were observed between PQCDTB and PC61BM as well. When the PCZDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 4 , a smooth morphology was detected , and no fibril domain was observed , just like the PQCDTB , because the self - organization of PCZDTB is lower than that of PQCDTB. 9 In this study , PQCDTB has been successfully synthesized through the Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing planar quinacridone unit and a broad - absorption benzothiadiazole unit. PQCDTB had a high molecular weight and good thermal stability. Because of the appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels , an effective balance was produced. According to the X-ray diffraction measurement , a broad diffraction peak was observed at approximately 24.0 ° . In terms of the π-π stacking distance ( d π ) , a significantly shorter distance ( 3.7 Å ) was observed. These values were similar to the results of the thiophene and thiophenefused aromatic system polymers. When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the highest efficiency was detected , and V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8% , and 2.5% , respectively. When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the polymer formed a fibril - type domain and microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM. Because of selforganization , PQCDTB showed a higher FF compared with PCZDTB.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
