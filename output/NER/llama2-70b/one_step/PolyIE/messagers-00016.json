Make sure to present the entities precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: We report the synthesis , characterization , and solar cell properties of new donor - acceptor - type low band gap polymers ( POBDTPD and PEBDTPD ) that incorporate dialkoxybenzodithiophene ( BDT ) as the donor and N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5-azacyclopenta[a]pentalene-4,6-dione ( DTPD ) as the acceptor. The newly developed DTPD moiety was carefully designed to lower a band gap via strong interaction between donor - acceptor moieties and keep polymer energy levels deep. Remarkably , the DTPD acceptor moiety effectively widens the light absorption range of the polymers up to ∼ 900 nm while positioning their HOMO and LUMO levels in the optimal range , i.e. , -5.3 and -4.0 eV , respectively , for high power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as we intended. Solar cell devices were fabricated according to the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / photoactive ( polymer : PC 70 BM ) / TiO 2 / Al. The POBDTPD devices exhibited a PCE of 4.7% with a V oc of 0.70 V , a J sc of 10.6 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.64. The PEBDTPD devices yielded a higher PCE of 5.3% with a V oc of 0.72 V , a J sc of 13.5 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.54. AFM , TEM , and PL quenching measurements revealed that the high J sc s are a result of the appropriate morphology and efficient charge separation. In comparing the performances of the two polymer devices , the higher J sc for the PEBDTPD device was attributed to its better nanoscale phase separation , smoother surface , and higher carrier mobility in the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films. The higher FF for the POBDTPD device was ascribed to a good balance between the hole and electron mobilities. Overall , we demonstrate that the DTPD unit is a promising electron - accepting moiety to develop high performance low band gap polymers . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted great attention for their potential utility in the production of large - area , low - cost , and flexible photovoltaic devices via solution processing. 1-4 To achieve high power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) , electrondonor polymers should have the following desirable characteristics : ( i ) good absorption spectral overlap with the solar spectrum , ( ii ) optimal energy level alignment with respect to electron - acceptor fullerene derivatives ( typically [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 60 BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) ) to facilitate efficient exciton separation , ( iii ) formation of a nanoscale interpenetrating network of the polymer and fullerene domains inside the photoactive layer , and ( iv ) provision of effective charge transport carriers toward the electrodes. To meet these requirements , intensive research efforts have been focused on integrating electron - rich donor units and electron - deficient acceptor units into a single conjugated polymeric system.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
