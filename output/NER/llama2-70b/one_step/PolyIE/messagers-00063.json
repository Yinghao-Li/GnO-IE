The acceptor units were varied from BT to BO for adjusting the energy levels and optimizing the structures of polymers. Both copolymers possess good solubility , high thermal stability , broad absorption , and low bandgap and exhibit not only high field - effect mobilities but also high photovoltaic properties. The hole mobilities reach 0.43 and 0.34 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO film , respectively. Bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated by using PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO as electron donor and PC71BM as acceptor show a power conversion efficiency of 3.22% and 5.07% , respectively , under illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW cm^-2 .
