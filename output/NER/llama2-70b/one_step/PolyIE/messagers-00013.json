These results suggest that on the absorption of the polymers , both absorption peaks and absorption coefficients could be readily controlled by tailoring the number of thienyl spacers along the polymers. 37,39,40 The absorption edge shifts from ca. 900 nm in PDTP-BT to ca. 850 nm in PDTP - DTBT and ca. 750 nm in PDTP-DT2BT , reflecting the broadening of the optical band - gap in sequence. Table 1 shows the optical band - gaps ( E opt g ) of all polymers estimated from the corresponding UV - vis absorption onset. PDTP-DT2BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-BT have optical band gaps of 1.61 , 1.46 and 1.41 eV , respectively , which are close to the ideal value of 1.5 eV for PSC application. These changes of the absorption spectra upon the introduction of thienyl groups can be qualitatively understood from density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations of the corresponding model compounds ( Fig. S1 † ). The optimized structures show that all the polymer backbones are mostly planar. Time dependent DFT calculations show that the absorption band in the longer wavelength is mainly attributed to the transition from HOMO delocalized in the D-A backbone to LUMO localized in DTP units for all the polymers. On the other hand , the absorption in the shorter wavelength is largely contributed by the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1 , which is similar to π-π* transition in polythiophene judging by the shape of the orbitals. Therefore , the introduction of more thienyl spacer could stabilize LUMO+1 ( π* ) due to the better conjugation , resulting in the red - shift of the absorption band. At the same time , it could decrease the D-A nature of the polymer due to the weaker electron acceptability of DTP , resulting in the blueshift of the charge transfer bands . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the polymers and estimate the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers. Representative cyclic voltammogram ( CV ) curves of these copolymers are shown in Fig. 2 Crystalline order of the copolymer thin films was investigated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) scans ( Fig. S2 † ). In the out - of - plane measurement , the XRD pattern of PDTP-BT reveals a weak peak near 6 ° , and there is no clear peak for PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT , suggesting that they exhibit amorphous structures in the film , which might be due to the bulky side chain in the DTP building block. A change in the number of thienyl spacers in this system does not significantly affect the aggregation behaviour of the polymer main chains.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
