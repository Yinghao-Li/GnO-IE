Such a D-A strategy is now widely used as one of the most promising approaches to design efficient polymers for application to the polymer photovoltaic. Thiophene is a simple and fundamental block to construct new D-A type copolymers. Recently , the bridged dithiophene has attracted considerable attention as a donor unit because of its ability to fix the dithiophene system into a planar structure , which is much more efficient than the dithiophene in constructing highly - conjugated copolymers. Four bridging dithiophene units with the atoms of carbon ( C ) , silicon ( Si ) , germanium ( Ge ) and nitrogen ( N ) afford cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene ( CPDT ) , dithienosilole ( DTS ) , dithienogermole ( DTG ) and dithieno [ 3,2- b : 2′,3′-d]pyrrole ( DTP ) , respectively. CPDT was first introduced into the low band gap polymers , and the corresponding copolymer alternating CPDT with benzothiadiazole showed a PCE of 5.5% , after using a small amount of alkanedithiols to control the morphology of the blend film. 14,15 Later on , large amounts of CPDT - based photovoltaic polymers were designed and synthesized. [16][17][18][19][20] In comparison with the C-C bond , a longer C-Si bond shows less steric hindrance , which directly resulted in better π-π stacking along the conjugated polymer backbones. 21,22 Polymers based on DTS normally have high hole mobility and strong light absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum and hence the improvement in photovoltaic performance , which reached 5.1% . 12 DTG shows lower intermolecular steric hindrance than DTS because of the longer C-Ge bond compared to the C-Si , resulting in the corresponding DTG - containing solar cells exhibiting higher short - current and fill factor. [23][24][25] Planar dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole ( DTP ) , with good π-conjugation , showed great potential for use in organic electronic materials. 26 D-A type photovoltaic polymers with DTP as the electron - donating unit , exhibiting low band gap and enhanced solubility , have been intensively applied to PSCs. 27,28 In our previous study , PSCs based on DTP - containing copolymers and PC 70 BM showed a short - circuit current as high as 22.6 mA cm^-1 , 29 indicating that DTP - containing copolymers could be promising building blocks for superior photovoltaic performance. On the other hand , benzothiadiazole ( BT ) containing the electron - withdrawing imine ( -CvN- ) nitrogen has been widely used as a strong acceptor in D-A copolymers. 30,31 Numerous attempts to develop novel D-A copolymers have shown that 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) is an effective acceptor unit , and photovoltaic devices made from blends with fullerene derivatives show PCE up to 5.4% .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
