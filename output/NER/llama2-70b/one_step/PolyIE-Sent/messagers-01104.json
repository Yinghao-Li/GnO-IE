PDTP stands for poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), while DTDPP(Bu) stands for N,N'-ditolyl-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-2,5-dicarboxamide.\n* Arrival rate refers to the rate at which a certain quantity of particles or molecules arrive at a given location.\n* cm^2 V^-1 s^-1 is a unit of measurement that represents the rate at which a certain quantity of particles or molecules pass through a given area per unit time."
