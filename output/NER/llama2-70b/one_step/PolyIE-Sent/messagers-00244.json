They are not specific names of materials, but rather descriptive terms used to characterize the electronic properties of the polymers. Therefore, they are not included in the list of \"Material Name\" entities.\n\nThe only material name mentioned in the paragraph is \"polymers\", which is a general term that encompasses a wide range of materials.
