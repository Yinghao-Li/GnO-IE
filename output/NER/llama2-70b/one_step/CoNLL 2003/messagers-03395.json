However, we can identify a few entities that can be classified as \"Person\" based on their context:\n\n1. Halftime: Halftime is a personification of the concept of halftime in a sports game. It is a common practice to personify abstract concepts or inanimate objects in language, and in this case, Halftime is being treated as a person who is involved in the game.\n2. 1: The number 1 is also personified in this paragraph. It is being used to represent the score of one team, and it can be argued that it is a personification of the team itself.\n3. 0: Similarly, the number 0 is also personified in this paragraph, representing the score of the opposing team.\n\nTherefore, the three entities that can be identified as \"Person\" in this paragraph are:\n\n* Halftime\n* 1\n* 0"},
