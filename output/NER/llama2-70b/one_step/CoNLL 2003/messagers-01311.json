Therefore, the two instances of \"deputy\" can be combined into a single entity, \"deputy,\" which represents the organization or position.\n\nHere's a Markdown table representing the identified organization entity:\n\n| Organization |\n| --- |\n| deputy |\n\nNote that the word \"deputy\" is not a proper noun in this context, and it does not refer to a specific organization or agency. Therefore, it is not necessary to capitalize it."},

Here's the revised table with the valid entities that clearly refer to an organization:\n\n| Organization |\n| --- |\n| deputy |\n\nThe word \"deputy\" in the paragraph refers to a position within a government or law enforcement agency, which can be considered as an organization. Therefore, the only valid entity that refers to an organization in the paragraph is \"deputy.\""}
