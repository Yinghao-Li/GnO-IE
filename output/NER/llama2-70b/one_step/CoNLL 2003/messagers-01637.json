INSURED - a term used to describe a financial institution that is insured by the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) or NCUA (National Credit Union Administration).\n\nTherefore, the table above presents the locations mentioned in the paragraph, with the column \"Location\" containing the entities \"FSA\" and \"INSURED\"."},

It's a term used to describe a financial institution's insurance status, not a physical location.\n\nTherefore, the only valid entity that refers to a location in the paragraph is \"FSA\" (Financial Services Authority), which is a regulatory body in the United Kingdom.\n\nI apologize for the mistake in my previous response."}
