Therefore, there are no valid \"Person\" entities in the paragraph.\n\nThe word \"Scottish\" refers to a nationality or an adjective describing a person's origin, but it does not clearly refer to a specific person. Similarly, the word \"one\" is a pronoun that refers to a general person or a group, but it does not clearly refer to a specific person.\n\nTherefore, the table above contains no entries, as there are no valid \"Person\" entities in the given paragraph."}
