The players may have played for various teams throughout their careers, and their names alone do not clearly indicate a specific organization.\n\nTherefore, the only valid organization that can be identified in the paragraph is the Australian national cricket team, which is mentioned explicitly.\n\nThe table above presents the valid organization entity in the paragraph, with the name of the organization presented precisely as it appears in the original paragraph."}
