Exports\n2. Domestic\n3. Disappearance\n\nThese entities are not explicitly stated as organizations in the paragraph, but they can be considered as organizations based on their context and the way they are presented.\n\nHere's a brief explanation for each entity:\n\n1. Exports: This refers to the act of selling and transporting goods or services to another country. In this context, Exports can be considered as an organization that deals with international trade.\n2. Domestic: This refers to things that are related to a country's internal affairs, especially its economy and politics. Domestic can be considered as an organization that focuses on issues related to the home country.\n3. Disappearance: This refers to the act of something ceasing to exist or being unable to be found. Disappearance can be considered as an organization that deals with investigations and solving mysteries related to missing persons or objects.\n\nPlease note that the interpretation of these entities as organizations is based on the context of the paragraph and may not be universally accepted."},
