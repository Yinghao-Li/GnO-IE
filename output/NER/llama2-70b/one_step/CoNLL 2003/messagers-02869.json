However, we can identify a few entities that can be classified as \"Person\" based on their context:\n\n1. Halftime: Halftime is a personification of the concept of halftime in a sports game. It is a common convention in sports to refer to the halftime period as a person, often using gendered pronouns like \"he\" or \"she.\" In this case, \"Halftime\" is a person entity.\n2. 1: The number 1 is a person entity in this context because it refers to a player who scored a goal. In sports, players are often referred to by their number, and in this case, the number 1 is a person who scored a goal during halftime.\n3. 0: Similarly, the number 0 is a person entity because it refers to a player who did not score a goal during halftime.\n\nTherefore, the three person entities in this paragraph are:\n\n* Halftime\n* 1\n* 0"},

Therefore, the only valid person entity in the paragraph is \"Halftime,\" which is a personification of the concept of halftime in a sports game.\n\nHere is the updated table with the valid person entities:\n\n| Person |\n| --- |\n| Halftime |"}
