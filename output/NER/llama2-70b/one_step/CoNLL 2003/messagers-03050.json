However, the paragraph does mention two entities that can be considered as \"Person\" in a broader sense:\n\n1. SCOTTISH LEAGUE - This can be considered as a person entity since it is a league of football clubs, which is a collection of individuals who are involved in organizing and participating in the league.\n2. CUP RESULTS - This can also be considered as a person entity since it refers to the outcome of a cup competition, which involves individuals participating in the competition and their performances.\n\nTherefore, the two entities that can be considered as \"Person\" in the given paragraph are SCOTTISH LEAGUE and CUP RESULTS."},
