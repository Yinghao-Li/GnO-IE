The word \"organisers\" is a valid entity in this context, as it refers to a group of people who are working together to plan and execute the event.\n\nTherefore, the only person entity in this paragraph is \"Organisers\"."},

Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a valid \"Person\" entity.\n\nAs a result, there are no valid person entities in the given paragraph.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with."}
