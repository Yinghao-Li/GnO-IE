However, we can consider the following entities as \"Person\" for the purpose of this task:\n\n1. GENERAL: This can be considered a person entity as it is a common noun used to refer to a high-ranking military officer or a general public figure.\n2. OBLIGATION: This can be considered a person entity as it is a concept that refers to a duty or commitment that an individual or organization has towards another party.\n3. BONDS: This can be considered a person entity as it is a financial instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower, typically a corporation or government entity.\n\nTherefore, the table above presents the valid entities in the paragraph as a Markdown table with one column \"Person\".
