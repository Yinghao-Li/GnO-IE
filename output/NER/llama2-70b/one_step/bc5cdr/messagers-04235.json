The term \"anabolizing\" is not a disease, but rather a term that refers to a class of drugs that promote muscle growth. Similarly, \"vitamin E deficient\" is not a disease, but rather a condition that can lead to myopathy. Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"myopathic\"."}
