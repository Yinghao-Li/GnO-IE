Here's the revised table with the valid disease entities:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) |\n\nThe only disease entity in the paragraph is \"intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)\". \"Prenatal caffeine exposure\" does not refer to a disease, but rather a potential risk factor for IUGR."}
