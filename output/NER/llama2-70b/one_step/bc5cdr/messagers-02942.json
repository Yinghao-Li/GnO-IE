Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Myocardial |\n| cTnI |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Myocardial refers to the heart muscle, and myocardial infarction (heart attack) is a disease.\n* cTnI stands for cardiac troponin I, which is a protein released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged, such as during a heart attack. Elevated levels of cTnI in the blood can be an indicator of a heart attack, so it's considered a disease marker."},
