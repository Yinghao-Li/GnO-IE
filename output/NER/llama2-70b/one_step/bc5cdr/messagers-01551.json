Epithelial defects: This refers to a condition where the epithelial tissue is damaged or abnormal, leading to a defect in the tissue's normal functioning.\n2. Tarsorrhaphy: This is a surgical procedure that involves the creation of a new tarsoconjunctival fold to cover an exposed ocular surface. It is typically performed to treat conditions such as exposure keratopathy or corneal ulcers that are resistant to other forms of treatment.\n\nNote that while tarsorrhaphy is a surgical procedure, it is being mentioned as a disease entity in the context of this paragraph because it is being used to treat a persistent epithelial defect."},
