It is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, but it is often referred to as a \"receptor\" or \"protein\" in biochemical contexts.\n\nNote that the term \"ERK pathway\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a biochemical pathway that involves a series of protein interactions and signaling events.
