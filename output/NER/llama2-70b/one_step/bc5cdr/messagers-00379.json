The term \"antimicrobial\" is not a specific chemical entity, but rather a broader term that refers to a class of chemicals that include antibiotics and other compounds that inhibit the growth of microorganisms. Therefore, I have removed \"antimicrobial\" from the list of valid chemical entities."}
