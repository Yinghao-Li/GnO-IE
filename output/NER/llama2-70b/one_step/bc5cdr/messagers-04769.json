Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| gamma - aminobutyric acid - ergic deficiency |\n| gamma - aminobutyric acid - mimetic agent |\n\nI couldn't find any disease entities in the given paragraph. The two occurrences of \"gamma - aminobutyric acid\" refer to a neurotransmitter, not a disease. The term \"deficiency\" suggests a shortage or lack of something, but in this context, it doesn't seem to be a disease. The term \"mimetic agent\" refers to a substance that imitates the action of another substance, and in this case, it's not a disease.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!"},
