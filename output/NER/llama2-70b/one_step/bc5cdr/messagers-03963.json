It is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, but rather a medical term used to describe a symptom or condition related to the breast tissue. Therefore, it is not included in the table as a chemical entity.\n\nNote that the paragraph does not mention any specific chemicals or drugs related to breast stimulation or mastodynia, so there are no chemical entities to list in the table."},
