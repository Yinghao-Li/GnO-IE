It is characterized by the death of dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra, leading to motor impairments.\n* CB1 KO: This is a genetic knockout of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), which is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including pain, inflammation, and neuroprotection.\n* WT: This stands for \"wild-type,\" which refers to a mouse that has not been genetically modified and has a normal, healthy genotype."},

Therefore, they are not included in the table."}
