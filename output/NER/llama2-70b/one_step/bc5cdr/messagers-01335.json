The test is named after its developer, Dr. Lawrence Humphrey, and the \"10-2\" refers to the specific test protocol used. While \"Humphrey 10-2\" is not a chemical substance, it is a specific medical test that is commonly used in ophthalmology and is therefore considered a valid chemical entity in this context."},
