Here are the entities in the paragraph that refer to diseases:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| GM-mediated nephropathy |\n| renal vasoconstriction |\n\nThe paragraph mentions two diseases:\n\n1. GM-mediated nephropathy, which is a type of nephropathy (kidney disease) that is mediated by GM (presumably a substance or agent that causes the disease).\n2. Renal vasoconstriction, which is a condition where the blood vessels in the kidneys constrict or narrow, leading to decreased blood flow and potentially causing damage to the kidneys."},

The term \"renal vasoconstriction\" refers to a physiological response that can be a symptom of various diseases, but it is not a disease entity itself."}
