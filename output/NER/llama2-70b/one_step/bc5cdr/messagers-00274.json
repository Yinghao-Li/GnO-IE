It is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition.\n* ventricular tachycardia is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that originates in the ventricles. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the given paragraph is:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| None |\n\nNote: The paragraph does not mention any specific chemicals or drugs, only medical conditions and physiological phenomena."},
