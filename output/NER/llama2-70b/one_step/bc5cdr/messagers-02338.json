It is a chemical substance that is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps to replace the dopamine that is lost in Parkinson's disease.\n\nNote:\n\n* Inhibitory cerebellar stimulation is not a chemical entity, but a technique that has been shown to reduce LIDs in some studies. Therefore, it has been removed from the table."}
