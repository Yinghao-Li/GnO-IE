Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| acute myocardial ischemia |\n| apoptotic pathways |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"acute myocardial ischemia\" is a disease entity in the paragraph, as it refers to a condition where there is a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to tissue damage or cell death.\n* \"apoptotic pathways\" is not a disease entity in the paragraph, as it refers to a biological process that occurs in cells, rather than a disease or condition.\n\nNote that \"STAT3\" is not a disease entity, it's a protein that plays a role in signal transduction and gene regulation."},
