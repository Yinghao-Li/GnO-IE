    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| PR interval |\n\nThe PR interval is a measure of the time it takes for the electrical activity of the heart to pass from the atria to the ventricles, and is a component of the electrocardiogram (ECG). Prolongation of the PR interval can be a sign of various cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiovascular diseases. In this context, PR interval is not a disease entity, but rather a diagnostic indicator of potential cardiac abnormalities.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the given paragraph is:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| cardiac arrhythmias |"},
