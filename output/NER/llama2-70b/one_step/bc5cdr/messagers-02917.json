IT chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer, and the paragraph mentions that the patient received concurrent IT chemotherapy, which suggests that the patient had cancer and was undergoing treatment for it. Therefore, cancer can be inferred as a disease entity in this paragraph."},

It is a condition or a disorder, but not a disease caused by the administration of a drug. Therefore, cancer is not a valid disease entity in this paragraph.\n\nThe table above presents the valid disease entity, Neurotoxicity, in the same words as in the original paragraph."}
