Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| urolithiasis |\n| HIV |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Urolithiasis is a disease characterized by the formation of calculi (stones) in the urinary tract.\n* HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a viral infection that can lead to various opportunistic infections and complications, including urolithiasis.\n\nNote that \"HIV\" is not a disease itself, but rather a viral infection that can cause various diseases and complications. However, in the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned as a risk factor for urolithiasis, so it is included in the table as a disease entity."},

Therefore, it is not included in the table as a disease entity."}

The other mentioned entity, \"HIV protease inhibitor\", is a class of drugs that includes Indinavir, but it is not a specific chemical entity. Therefore, the table above presents only \"Indinavir\" as the valid chemical entity in the paragraph."}
