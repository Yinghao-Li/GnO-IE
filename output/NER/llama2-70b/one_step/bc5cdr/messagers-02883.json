Pilsicainide: A drug used to convert paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.\n2. Sodium channel blocker: A class of drugs that block the flow of sodium ions through the cardiac sodium channels, which can help regulate the heart's rhythm. Pilsicainide is a specific type of sodium channel blocker with slow recovery kinetics."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's the updated table with only the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| Pilsicainide |\n\nThe paragraph only refers to one chemical entity, Pilsicainide, which is a drug used to convert paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. The term \"sodium channel blocker\" is not a specific chemical entity, but rather a class of drugs that includes Pilsicainide. Therefore, it has been removed from the table."}
