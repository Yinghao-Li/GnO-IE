Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by a decrease in bone density and an increase in bone fragility.\n2. Bone resorption: Bone resorption is a process where bone tissue is broken down and reabsorbed by the body, which can lead to bone loss and is a key factor in the development of osteoporosis.\n\nNote that while bone resorption is not itself a disease, it is a process that contributes to the development of osteoporosis, which is a disease. Therefore, it is included as a \"Disease\" entity in the table."},
