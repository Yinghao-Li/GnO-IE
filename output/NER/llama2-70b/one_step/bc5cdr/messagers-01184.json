Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| LV hypertrophy |\n| TGR |\n| SD |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* LV hypertrophy is a disease entity because it is a condition where the left ventricle of the heart becomes enlarged, which can lead to various cardiovascular problems.\n* TGR and SD are not disease entities in this context. TGR stands for \"transgenic rat\" and SD stands for \"spontaneously hypertensive rat,\" which are both rat models used in scientific research to study certain diseases or conditions. They are not diseases themselves, but rather models used to study the effects of certain diseases or conditions."},
