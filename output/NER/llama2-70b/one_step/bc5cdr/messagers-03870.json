Generalized seizures: This is a condition where seizures affect both sides of the brain and can cause a range of symptoms such as convulsions, muscle stiffness, and loss of consciousness.\n2. Post-operative analgesia: This refers to pain relief after surgery, which is a common use of morphine sulfate. It is not a disease but a medical condition that requires treatment.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is generalized seizures."},
