    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's the updated table with the valid entities that clearly refer to \"Disease\":\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| leukocyturia |\n\nThe entity \"persistent\" is not a disease, but rather an adjective describing the duration of the disease. Similarly, \"sterile\" is also an adjective modifying the noun \"leukocyturia\". Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the given paragraph is \"leukocyturia\"."}
