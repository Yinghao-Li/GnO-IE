Here are the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph you provided:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| STZ |\n| apoptotic cell death |\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each entity:\n\n1. STZ: STZ stands for streptozotocin, which is a chemical that is used to induce diabetes in animal models. It is not a disease itself, but it can cause damage to the pancreas and lead to diabetes.\n2. Apoptotic cell death: Apoptosis is a programmed form of cell death, which is a natural process that occurs in cells throughout the body. However, excessive or uncontrolled apoptosis can be a sign of disease, such as in the case of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. In the context of the paragraph, the mention of apoptotic cell death in the hippocampus and cortex suggests that the STZ treatment may be causing damage to these brain regions."},

Therefore, it has been removed from the table."}
