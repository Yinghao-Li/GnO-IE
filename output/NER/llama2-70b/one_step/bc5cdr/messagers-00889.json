Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| cardiotoxicity |\n| cardiomyocyte oxidative damage |\n| cardiomyocyte nitrative damage |\n\nI identified the following three entities as diseases in the given paragraph:\n\n1. Cardiotoxicity - This is a condition where the heart muscle is damaged due to exposure to a toxic substance, in this case, adriamycin (ADR).\n2. Cardiomyocyte oxidative damage - This refers to damage caused to cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) due to an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds.\n3. Cardiomyocyte nitrative damage - This refers to damage caused to cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) due to the formation of nitrogen species (RNS) and their reaction with cellular components.\n\nThese entities were identified based on their mention in the paragraph as being related to the study's purpose and the effects of adriamycin (ADR) on the heart muscle."},
