It is a chemical entity that is mentioned in the paragraph.\n* Atropine is a parasympathetic blockade, which means it blocks the action of the parasympathetic nervous system. It is also a chemical entity that is mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nNote that \"heart rate\" (HR) is not a chemical entity, it is a physiological parameter that is being measured in the study. Similarly, \"TGR\" and \"SD\" are not chemical entities, they are abbreviations for \"Tigrina\" and \"Sprague-Dawley\" rat strains, respectively."},
