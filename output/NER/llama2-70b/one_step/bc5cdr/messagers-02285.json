The emphasis is on the effects of various compounds on the cardiovascular system of dogs, specifically their coronary arteries and systemic hemodynamics. The dogs are described as \"chronically instrumented conscious dogs,\" which implies that they have been prepared for long-term monitoring and data collection, but it is not a disease entity."},

The term \"chronically instrumented conscious dogs\" refers to a preparation method for dogs used in scientific research, and not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the table above contains the only entity that can be considered a disease, which is \"chronically instrumented conscious dogs\". However, this entity does not clearly refer to a disease, and therefore, there are no valid disease entities in the given paragraph."}
