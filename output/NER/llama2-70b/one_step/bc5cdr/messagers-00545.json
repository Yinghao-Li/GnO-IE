The mentioned entities are:\n\n* OR (Odds Ratio)\n* 95 % CI (95% Confidence Interval)\n\nThese are statistical measures used to express the strength and significance of the relationship between a risk factor (in this case, gender) and an outcome (not specified in the given paragraph). They are not diseases, so they are not included in the table.\n\nThe table above presents the entities that are not diseases but are mentioned in the paragraph."},
