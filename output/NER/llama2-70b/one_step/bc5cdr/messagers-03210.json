It is not a distinct disease entity, but rather a subset of nephropathy.\n* Serum, urine, gene, and protein renal expression biomarkers are not disease entities, but rather biological samples or markers that can be used to diagnose or monitor diseases.\n\nTherefore, the only valid disease entity in the paragraph is Nephropathy."}
