Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| seizures |\n| seizure |\n\nI'll explain my answer:\n\n1. \"seizures\" is a disease entity because it's a disorder characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n2. \"seizure\" is also a disease entity for the same reason. It's a singular form of the word, but it still refers to the same condition.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."},
