It could potentially refer to a group or category of chemicals, but without further context, it's not clear what specific chemicals are being referred to.\n* The percentages mentioned in the paragraph (85%, 40%, 70%, and 25%) were also removed, as they are not names of chemical substances.\n\nThe remaining three entities - F, M, and FM - are clearly references to specific chemical substances and are presented in the table above."}
