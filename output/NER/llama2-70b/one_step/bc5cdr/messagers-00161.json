Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| tachycardia |\n| tachycardia |\n\nI have identified two entities as \"Disease\" in the given paragraph:\n\n1. \"tachycardia\" - mentioned twice in the paragraph as an exercise-induced condition that dronedarone and amiodarone can reduce.\n\nPlease note that \"tachycardia\" refers to a rapid heart rate, usually above 100 beats per minute. It can be a symptom of various conditions, such as stress, anxiety, or certain medical conditions like arrhythmias or hyperthyroidism.

Therefore, \"isoproterenol-induced tachycardia\" is not a distinct disease entity, but rather a symptom or side effect of the medication.\n\nThe remaining entity, \"tachycardia,\" is a disease entity that refers to a rapid heart rate, usually above 100 beats per minute. It can be a symptom of various conditions, such as stress, anxiety, or certain medical conditions like arrhythmias or hyperthyroidism. In the context of the paragraph, the reference is likely to exercise-induced tachycardia."}
