The DRD2 gene encodes for a subtype of dopamine receptor, which is a type of transmembrane receptor. The receptor mentioned in the paragraph is likely referring to the dopamine receptor, which is a chemical entity that plays a role in modulating receptor expression."},

The term \"receptor\" is not specific enough to be considered a valid chemical entity in this context, as it could refer to any type of receptor. Therefore, the table only includes the DRD2 gene as a valid chemical entity."}
