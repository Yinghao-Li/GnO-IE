Ouabain: Ouabain is a chemical compound that is used as a cardiac glycoside and has been shown to have various physiological effects, including the ability to induce hyperlocomotion in rats.\n2. 10 ( - 2 ) M: This represents a concentration of ouabain, specifically 10 minus 2 millimolar (mM).\n3. 10 ( - 3 ) M: This represents a concentration of ouabain, specifically 10 minus 3 millimolar (mM).\n4. ICV: ICV stands for intracerebroventricular, which refers to the method of administering a substance directly into the cerebral ventricles of the brain. In this context, the ouabain was administered to rats through an ICV injection."},
