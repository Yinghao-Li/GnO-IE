ED-1 is a protein that is upregulated in response to cellular stress, MAP kinases are a family of enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways, and NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression. In this context, their increased staining in the renal cortex of gentamicin-treated rats indicates the presence of disease."},
