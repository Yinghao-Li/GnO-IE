However, the text refers to different patient groups based on the presence or absence of myocardial infarction (MI), which can be considered as diseases. Therefore, the entities that can be identified as \"Disease\" in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. non-MI group (referring to patients without myocardial infarction)\n2. ANT-MI group (referring to patients with anterior myocardial infarction)\n3. INF-MI group (referring to patients with inferior myocardial infarction)\n4. total population (referring to the overall population of patients being studied, which includes both healthy individuals and those with myocardial infarction)"},
