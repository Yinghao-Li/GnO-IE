Here are the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph you provided:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| DBA / 2 |\n| C57BL / 6 |\n\nNote that \"DBA / 2\" and \"C57BL / 6\" are both mouse strains, which are commonly used in scientific research to study various diseases and conditions. In this context, they are not diseases themselves, but rather the genetic backgrounds of the mice that are being studied. Therefore, they are not typically considered \"disease\" entities in the classical sense.\n\nHowever, I included them in the table above since they are mentioned in the context of studying the delayed toxicity of cyclophosphamide on the bladder, which could potentially be a disease or condition."},

The other entities mentioned in the paragraph, \"DBA / 2\" and \"C57BL / 6,\" are mouse strains and not diseases."}
