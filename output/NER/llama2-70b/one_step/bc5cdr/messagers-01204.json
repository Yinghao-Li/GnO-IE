Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the given paragraph is \"Hypertension\"."}

The other words in the paragraph, such as \"experimental hypertension,\" \"removal,\" \"mechanisms,\" \"arterial vasodilator activity,\" do not refer to chemical entities. Therefore, the table above only includes \"NO\" as the valid chemical entity in the paragraph."}
