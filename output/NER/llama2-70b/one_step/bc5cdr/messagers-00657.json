The other words that could be considered as chemicals, such as \"systemic chemotherapy\" and \"intraocular retinoblastoma\", do not clearly refer to specific chemical entities, but rather to a medical treatment and a medical condition, respectively. Therefore, the table above only includes \"Carboplatin\" as the valid chemical entity in the paragraph."}
