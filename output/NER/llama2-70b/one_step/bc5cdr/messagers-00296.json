Exaggerated adrenergic response: This is a condition where the body's response to stress or certain medications leads to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.\n2. Tachydysrhythmias: This refers to abnormal heart rhythms that are too fast, specifically excluding sinus tachycardia.\n3. Sinus tachycardia: This is a normal heart rhythm that occurs when the heart beats faster than usual, typically due to stress or exercise. It is not considered a disease, but is mentioned in the paragraph as an exception to the definition of tachydysrhythmias."},
