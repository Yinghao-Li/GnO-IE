It is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, but it is often used in medical contexts and is relevant to the patient's condition.\n* Computed tomography (CT) scan is a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays to produce detailed cross-sectional images of the body. It is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of medical diagnosis and treatment.\n* Cardiac arrest is a medical condition where the heart stops functioning properly, and it is not a chemical entity."},
