It is a barbiturate used to control seizures and sedate patients, and it has been shown to cause liver damage and abnormal liver function in some cases. However, it is not a disease entity in the context of the given paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is hepatomegaly."},
