    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The entities in the paragraph that refer to diseases are:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| 5-HT1A |\n| 5-HT2A |\n| D2 |\n\nThese are all receptors that are involved in various physiological processes and are also implicated in certain diseases. For example, the 5-HT1A receptor is involved in regulating mood, appetite, and sleep, and dysfunction in this receptor has been implicated in depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders. The 5-HT2A receptor is involved in regulating mood, perception, and cognitive processes, and dysfunction in this receptor has been implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other psychotic disorders. The D2 receptor is involved in regulating movement and mood, and dysfunction in this receptor has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and other movement disorders."},

While dysfunction in the D2 receptor has been implicated in certain movement disorders, the term \"D2\" does not directly refer to a specific disease."}
