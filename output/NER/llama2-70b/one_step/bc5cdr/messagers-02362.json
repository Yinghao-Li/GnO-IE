The terms \"edema\" and \"vasodilation\" are not chemical entities, but rather medical conditions. \"Inflammatory cells\" is also not a specific chemical entity, but rather a term that encompasses various cell types involved in the inflammatory response. Therefore, the table above contains no chemical entities."}
