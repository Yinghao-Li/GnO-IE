Upon reevaluating the paragraph, I realized that \"HIT\" and \"heparin exposure\" are not diseases, but rather a condition and a medication, respectively. Therefore, the only valid disease entities in the paragraph are \"thrombosis\" and \"thrombosis\" (since it's mentioned twice).\n\nHere's the updated table with the correct disease entities:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Thrombosis |\n| Thrombosis |"}
