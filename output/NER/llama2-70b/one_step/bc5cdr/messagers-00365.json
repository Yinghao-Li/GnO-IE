They are not included in the table.\n* Hand-foot syndrome is a condition that can be caused by certain chemicals, but it is not a specific chemical entity. It is not included in the table.\n* Skin reactions can be caused by chemicals, but the term \"skin reactions\" is too broad to be considered a specific chemical entity.
