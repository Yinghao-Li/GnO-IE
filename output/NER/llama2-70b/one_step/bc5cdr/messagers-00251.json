Here are the entities in the paragraph that correspond to the \"Disease\" category:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| PTU |\n| MPO - ANCA |\n\nIn this paragraph, \"PTU\" refers to a drug called propylthiouracil, which is used to treat hyperthyroidism. \"MPO - ANCA\" refers to myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, which are autoantibodies that are associated with certain autoimmune diseases, such as vasculitis.
