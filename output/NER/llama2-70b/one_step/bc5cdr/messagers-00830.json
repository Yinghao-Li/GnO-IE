The paragraph describes the upregulation of genes involved in these processes, which suggests that the study is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism and transport, rather than disease states."},

The entities mentioned, \"fatty acid oxidation,\" \"lipoprotein assembly,\" and \"lipid transport,\" are biological processes, not diseases. Therefore, the table above contains no entities that clearly refer to diseases."}
