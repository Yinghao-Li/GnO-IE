While fibrosis is a disease, the term \"fibrotic areas\" in this context refers to a symptom or consequence of the disease, rather than the disease itself.\n* \"post-necrotic tissue repair\" is a disease entity because it refers to the process of repairing tissue damage that has occurred due to necrosis, which is a type of cell death that can occur due to various diseases or injuries."}
