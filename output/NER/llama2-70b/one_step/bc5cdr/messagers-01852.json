    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| 6 - OHDA |\n| CB1 KO |\n| PENK |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* 6 - OHDA: 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is a neurotoxin that selectively kills dopamine-producing neurons and is often used to model Parkinson's disease in animal studies.\n* CB1 KO: CB1 knockout (CB1 KO) refers to a genetic modification that disrupts the CB1 gene, which codes for the cannabinoid receptor 1. This gene is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including pain, inflammation, and neuroprotection.\n* PENK: PENK (proenkephalin) is a gene that encodes for a protein involved in the regulation of pain perception. Increased PENK gene expression has been observed in various neurological disorders, including chronic pain and Parkinson's disease.\n\nNote that while 6-OHDA and CB1 KO are not diseases per se, they are both used as models to study neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. PENK is a gene that is associated with various neurological disorders, but it is not a disease entity itself."},

The expression of the PENK gene is increased in response to various stimuli, including lesions induced by 6-OHDA."},
