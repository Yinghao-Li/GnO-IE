While they may be related to the context of the paragraph, they are not chemical entities.\n\nOn the other hand, \"electrolyte\" is a chemical entity that refers to a substance that conducts electricity and is essential for various bodily functions, such as maintaining fluid balance and nerve function. Therefore, it is a valid entity in the context of the paragraph."}
