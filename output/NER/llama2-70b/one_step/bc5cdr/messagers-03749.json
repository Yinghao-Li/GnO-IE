The term \"myocardial ischemia\" already implies that it's caused by something, and the context of the sentence makes it clear that it's induced by dipyridamole."}

The other terms, \"myocardial ischemia\" and \"myocardial blood flow\", are not chemical entities, but rather medical conditions and physiological processes. Therefore, the table above only includes \"Dipyridamole\" as the valid chemical entity in the paragraph."}
