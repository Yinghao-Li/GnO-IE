    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Chronic CYP administration |\n| NOS-IR |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Chronic CYP administration\" is a disease state characterized by the long-term administration of cypermethrin (CYP) to animals, leading to changes in the bladder afferent neurons.\n* \"NOS-IR\" is a disease state characterized by the expression of nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactivity (NOS-IR) in bladder afferent neurons, which is a result of chronic CYP administration.\n\nNote that \"bladder afferent cells\" and \"bladder wall\" are not diseases, but rather anatomical structures mentioned in the paragraph. \"Fluorogold\" is a substance used to label bladder afferent cells, and \"control animals\" refers to animals that do not receive chronic CYP administration and serve as a baseline for comparison."},
