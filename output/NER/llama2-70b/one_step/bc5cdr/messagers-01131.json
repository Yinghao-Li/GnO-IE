Upon reevaluating the paragraph, I realized that \"CPA\" does not refer to a chemical entity. It is an abbreviation for \"certified public accountant.\" Therefore, the valid chemical entities in the paragraph are none.\n\nHere's the updated table with no chemical entities:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n\nI hope this corrected response meets your requirements."}
