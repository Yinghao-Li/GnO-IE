Primary dysmenorrhea - a syndrome characterized by painful uterine contractility.\n2. Hypersecretion of endometrial prostaglandins - a condition where the endometrium secretes excessive amounts of prostaglandins, leading to painful uterine contractions.\n\nNote that while \"hypersecretion of endometrial prostaglandins\" is not a disease in the classical sense, it is still a disease entity in the context of the paragraph, as it is a condition that is being discussed as a cause of primary dysmenorrhea."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Primary dysmenorrhea |\n\nThe only disease entity clearly mentioned in the paragraph is \"Primary dysmenorrhea\". The term \"hypersecretion of endometrial prostaglandins\" does not clearly refer to a disease, but rather a physiological process that is associated with primary dysmenorrhea. Therefore, it should not be included in the list of disease entities."}
