Here are the possible disease entities that can be identified:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hypertension |\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"supine blood pressure\" and \"mmHg,\" which suggests that the patients being studied may have hypertension or high blood pressure. However, it's important to note that hypertension is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, and the reduction in blood pressure could be due to other factors as well. Therefore, this entity should be considered tentative."},

Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| mmHg |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph mentions blood pressure measurements, which are expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).
