Cardiac dysfunction: This refers to the impairment of the heart's ability to function properly, which is induced by cocaine use.\n2. Mitochondrial impairment: This refers to the damage or dysfunction of the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures within cells. This impairment is also related to cocaine use.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cardiac dysfunction\n* Mitochondrial impairment"},

Here are the valid disease entities in the paragraph, presented in a Markdown table with one column \"Disease\":\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| cardiac dysfunction |\n\nThe paragraph only mentions one disease entity, which is \"cardiac dysfunction\". The term \"mitochondrial impairment\" does not clearly refer to a disease, but rather a condition or a mechanism that contributes to the development of disease. Therefore, it is not included in the list of disease entities."}
