Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| ejection fraction |\n| dobutamine |\n\nI explained below why I didn't include the other conditions mentioned in the paragraph as \"Disease\" entities.\n\nThe paragraph discusses the effects of exercise and dobutamine on ejection fraction, which is a measure of the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Ejection fraction is not a disease entity, but rather a diagnostic measure used to assess cardiac function.\n\nDobutamine, on the other hand, is a medication used to treat certain cardiovascular conditions, such as heart failure and shock. In the context of the paragraph, dobutamine is not being discussed as a disease entity but rather as a medication that can affect ejection fraction.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"heart failure\", which is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred as a possible condition that may be treated with dobutamine. However, since the paragraph does not explicitly mention heart failure as a disease entity, I did not include it in the table."},
