Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| cardiac injury |\n| adrenergic pathway |\n\nI couldn't find any disease entities in the given paragraph. The two mentioned entities are:\n\n1. Cardiac injury: It is a condition in which the heart muscle is damaged, which can lead to impaired heart function and potentially life-threatening complications.\n2. Adrenergic pathway: It is a system of nerves that transmit signals from the sympathetic nervous system to various organs in the body, including the heart, and play a role in regulating heart rate and contractility.\n\nPlease note that \"cardiac injury\" and \"adrenergic pathway\" are not diseases but rather conditions or physiological pathways. If you meant to identify diseases, please provide a different paragraph or clarify your request."},
