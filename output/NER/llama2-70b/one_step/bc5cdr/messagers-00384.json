Here are the valid entities in the paragraph that clearly refer to \"Disease\":\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| levodopa-induced ocular dyskinesias |\n\nThe phrase \"severe dopaminergic denervation in the caudate nucleus\" does not clearly refer to a specific disease, but rather describes a condition that may contribute to the development of levodopa-induced ocular dyskinesias. Therefore, it should not be included in the list of diseases."}
