Upon reevaluating the paragraph, I realized that \"Bladder\" is not a disease entity. It is an anatomical structure, and its mention in the paragraph does not imply any disease. Therefore, the valid entities that can be identified as \"Disease\" in this context are none.\n\nHere's the updated table with no disease entities:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n\nI hope this corrected response meets your requirements."}
