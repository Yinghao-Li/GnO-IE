    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| anginal attacks |\n| bradycardia |\n| tachycardial |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Anginal attacks refer to chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood. It is a symptom of coronary artery disease.\n* Bradycardia refers to a slow heart rate, usually below 60 beats per minute.\n* Tachycardia refers to a fast heart rate, usually above 100 beats per minute.\n\nIn the paragraph, bepridil is mentioned as a novel active compound for the prophylactic treatment of anginal attacks. Prophylactic treatment means preventive treatment, so the mention of anginal attacks implies that bepridil is being studied as a potential treatment for coronary artery disease.\n\nThe paragraph also mentions that bepridil induced persistent bradycardia and a non-specific anti-tachycardial effect. This means that bepridil caused a slow heart rate and prevented rapid heart rate.\n\nTherefore, the three disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Anginal attacks (a symptom of coronary artery disease)\n2. Bradycardia (a slow heart rate)\n3. Tachycardia (a fast heart rate)"},

It is a symptom of coronary artery disease.\n* Bradycardia refers to a slow heart rate, usually below 60 beats per minute.\n\nThe mention of tachycardia (fast heart rate) was removed since it is not a disease entity but rather a physiological response that can be a symptom of various diseases."}
