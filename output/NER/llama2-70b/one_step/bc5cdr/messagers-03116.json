Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Myocardial infarction |\n| Cardiac dysfunction |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Myocardial infarction is a disease entity in the paragraph.\n* Cardiac dysfunction is also a disease entity in the paragraph, as it is a condition that affects the functioning of the heart.\n\nNote that while TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) is mentioned in the paragraph, it is not a disease entity. It is a protein that plays a role in the immune system, and its activity is being studied in relation to myocardial infarction and cardiac dysfunction. AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) is also not a disease entity, but rather an enzyme that plays a role in cellular energy homeostasis and is being studied in relation to myocardial infarction and cardiac dysfunction."},

They are not directly referring to a disease, and therefore, they are not included in the table."}
