Hypercapnic ventilatory response\n\nThe paragraph discusses how human corticotropin-releasing hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone modulate the hypercapnic ventilatory response in humans. The term \"hypercapnic ventilatory response\" refers to the response of the body to an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the blood, which can be a result of various diseases or conditions that affect respiratory function. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity in this context."},
