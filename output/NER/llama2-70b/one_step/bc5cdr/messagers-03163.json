However, it does mention \"seizures\" and \"epilepsy\" which can be considered related to neurological disorders. \"Seizures\" can be a symptom of various neurological conditions, including epilepsy, and the paragraph specifically mentions \"anticonvulsant activity\" which is a term related to the treatment of epilepsy and seizures. Therefore, I have included both \"seizures\" and \"epilepsy\" in the table as potential disease entities."},
