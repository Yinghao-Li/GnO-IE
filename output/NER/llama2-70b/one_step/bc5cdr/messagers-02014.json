It is not a disease entity in itself, but it can be used as a marker for diseases that involve abnormal cell growth, such as cancer.\n* ILK / liver refers to the liver tissue of animals that have been genetically modified to lack the ILK gene. This is not a disease entity, but rather a genetic modification that can be used to study the role of the ILK gene in various biological processes.\n* WT refers to wild-type animals, which are animals that have not been genetically modified and have the normal version of the ILK gene. This is not a disease entity, but rather a control group used for comparison in scientific studies."},
