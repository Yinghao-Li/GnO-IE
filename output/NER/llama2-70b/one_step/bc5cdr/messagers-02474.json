However, in the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned as a potential outcome that can be prevented by long-term oral galactose treatment. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n* Streptozotocin is a chemical that is used to induce diabetes in animal models, and it is not a disease itself. However, it is mentioned in the paragraph as a tool to induce cognitive deficits in rats, and therefore it is relevant to the discussion of diseases in this context."},
