The two terms mentioned are:\n\n* Arterial spasm: This is a medical condition where the muscular walls of an artery constrict or narrow, which can reduce blood flow to certain parts of the body.\n* L-norepinephrine: This is a medication used to treat various conditions, such as hypotension, shock, and anaphylaxis. It is a form of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating the body's \"fight or flight\" response.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph are not diseases but rather a medical condition (arterial spasm) and a medication (L-norepinephrine)."},
