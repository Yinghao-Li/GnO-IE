Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| scopolamine |\n| impairments of spontaneous alternation |\n| passive avoidance |\n\nI did not include \"nocistatin\" in the list of diseases, as it is not a disease but rather a peptide that is being studied for its potential therapeutic effects. \"Impairments of spontaneous alternation\" and \"passive avoidance\" are not diseases per se, but rather conditions or symptoms that can be caused by various diseases or disorders. However, they are still relevant to the context of the paragraph and are therefore included in the list."},

Therefore, it is the only entity that clearly refers to a disease and is included in the table.\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"impairments of spontaneous alternation\" and \"passive avoidance,\" are not diseases but rather conditions or symptoms that can be caused by various diseases or disorders. They are not included in the table."}
