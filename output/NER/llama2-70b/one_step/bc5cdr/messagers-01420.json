Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| MSSBP |\n| VAL |\n| HCTZ |\n\nI explain my answer as follows:\n\n\"MSSBP\" is a disease entity because it is a medical condition. \"VAL\" and \"HCTZ\" are drug entities, not diseases. \"P\" is not a disease entity; it is a statistical measure. The number 0.002 is not a disease entity; it is a numerical value."},
