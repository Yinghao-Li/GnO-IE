Therefore, \"PAN\" cannot be considered a valid disease entity in this context.\n\nThe only valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"saline,\" which is mentioned as a control substance that was injected into rats. \"Saline\" is not a disease, but it is used as a control in medical experiments to compare the effects of a substance being tested against a neutral substance."}
