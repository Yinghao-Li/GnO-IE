The abbreviation \"PRC\" is also used, which stands for \"contrast medium\" or \"contrast agent\". Therefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* PRC (contrast medium or contrast agent)\n\nNote that \"radiographic\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a term that refers to the use of X-rays or other forms of ionizing radiation in medical imaging."},

Therefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is \"PRC\" which stands for \"contrast medium\" or \"contrast agent\".\n\nThe updated table above presents the valid chemical entity in the paragraph, precisely in the same words as in the original paragraph, using Markdown formatting."}
