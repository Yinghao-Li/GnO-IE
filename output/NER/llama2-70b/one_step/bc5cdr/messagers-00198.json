Therefore, \"LCVA\" should be excluded from the list of chemical entities.\n\nThe remaining two entities, \"carbon tetrachloride\" and \"reactive terpenes,\" are clearly chemical compounds and are therefore valid chemical entities in the context of the paragraph. They are presented in the Markdown table above."}
