Acute renal failure: This is a sudden and temporary loss of kidney function that can be caused by various factors, including medication, injury, or disease.\n2. Gentamicin: Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that can cause kidney damage and acute renal failure, especially when given in high doses or for extended periods. It is not a disease but a medication that can cause adverse effects on the kidneys.\n\nTherefore, the only disease mentioned in the paragraph is acute renal failure."},
