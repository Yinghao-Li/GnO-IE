    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Y-MRS total score |\n\nThe \"Y-MRS total score\" is a disease entity in the paragraph because it is a measure of the severity of symptoms of a mental disorder, specifically schizophrenia. The Y-MRS (Young Mania Rating Scale) is a commonly used clinical rating scale that assesses the severity of manic symptoms, and a higher total score indicates greater severity of symptoms. In the paragraph, the improvement in Y-MRS total score is compared between olanzapine-treated patients and placebo-treated patients, indicating that the score is a measure of disease severity."},
