Elevated levels of PSA in the blood can be an indicator of prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or prostatitis. Therefore, all three conditions are relevant to the paragraph and can be identified as \"Disease\" entities."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Prostate cancer |\n| Prostatitis |\n\nExplanation:\n\nUpon re-evaluation, \"benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)\" does not clearly refer to a disease, but rather a condition that can cause enlargement of the prostate gland. Therefore, it should not be included as a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nThe remaining two entities, \"Prostate cancer\" and \"Prostatitis,\" clearly refer to diseases and are presented in the table above."}
