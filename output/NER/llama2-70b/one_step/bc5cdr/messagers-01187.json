Cardiac inotropic response: This refers to the ability of the heart to increase its pumping force in response to certain stimuli, such as beta-adrenergic agonists.\n2. Hypertrophy: This refers to the enlargement of the heart muscle, which can occur in response to various stimuli, including chronically low sympathetic outflow."},
