Seizure: It refers to a temporary disturbance in brain function that can cause various physical and mental symptoms, such as convulsions, muscle stiffness, and loss of consciousness.\n2. Epilepsy: It is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. These seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n\nNote that \"pilocarpine-induced seizure model\" is not a disease entity, but rather a method used to study seizures and test the anticonvulsant effects of drugs like MK-801."},
