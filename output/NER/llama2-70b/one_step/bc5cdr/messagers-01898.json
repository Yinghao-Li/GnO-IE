Delirium is a medical condition characterized by a sudden change in mental status, causing confusion, disorientation, and altered levels of consciousness. It is a serious disturbance in consciousness, attention, and perception that can be caused by various factors, including medication side effects, infections, or other medical conditions. In this paragraph, delirium is mentioned as a potential adverse effect of flecainide, a medication that is metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme."},
