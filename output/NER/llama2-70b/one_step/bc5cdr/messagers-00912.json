In the context of the paragraph, it is likely that \"WDS behavior\" refers to a similar behavior in rats or mice, which is induced by the drug ergometrine.\n* It's worth noting that \"haloperidol catalepsy\" and \"fluoxetine - induced penile erections\" are not diseases in the classical sense, but rather side effects or effects of the respective drugs on the body.
