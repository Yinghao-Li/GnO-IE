TIDA is a system in the brain that regulates hormone secretion, and PRL is a hormone that is produced and secreted by the pituitary gland. However, in the context of the paragraph, they are being discussed as entities that are related to disease, specifically in relation to their role in regulating hormone secretion and their potential impact on disease states."},
