It is used to diagnose and monitor certain genetic disorders related to lipid metabolism.\n\nNote that \"Crocin\" and \"diazinon\" are not diseases, but rather chemical compounds mentioned in the paragraph. \"ERK activation\" is also not a disease, but rather a cellular process that is affected by Crocin."},
