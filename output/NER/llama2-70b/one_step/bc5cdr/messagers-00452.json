Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| complete remission |\n| partial remission |\n| no change |\n| progressive disease |\n\nI interpreted \"complete remission,\" \"partial remission,\" \"no change,\" and \"progressive disease\" as chemical entities in the paragraph because they are all terms used in the context of medical treatment outcomes. \"Complete remission\" and \"partial remission\" refer to positive responses to treatment, while \"no change\" and \"progressive disease\" indicate a lack of response or worsening of the condition, respectively. These terms are commonly used in clinical trials and medical reports to describe the effectiveness of treatments, especially in oncology."},
