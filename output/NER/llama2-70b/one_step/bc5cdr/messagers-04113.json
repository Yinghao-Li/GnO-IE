    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| bilateral medullo - adrenalectomy |\n| ablation of all the extrinsic cardiac afferent nerve supply |\n\nI assume that by \"Disease\" you meant the medical conditions mentioned in the paragraph. The paragraph does not mention any diseases in the classical sense, but rather medical procedures. \"Bilateral medullo - adrenalectomy\" and \"ablation of all the extrinsic cardiac afferent nerve supply\" are surgical procedures. The paragraph does not mention any disease or condition that the procedures are meant to treat. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's the updated table with the valid entities:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| ablation of all the extrinsic cardiac afferent nerve supply |\n\nI removed \"bilateral medullo - adrenalectomy\" since it refers to a surgical procedure and not a disease.\n\nThe only remaining entity that clearly refers to a disease or medical condition is \"ablation of all the extrinsic cardiac afferent nerve supply\", which is a procedure that involves destruction or removal of the nerves that supply the heart."}
