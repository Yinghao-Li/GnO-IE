Therefore, it is included in the table as a valid entity.\n\nThe other entity mentioned in the paragraph, \"5 Mb telomeric to HLA,\" does not clearly refer to a disease or medical condition. It appears to be a genetic locus or a genomic region, rather than a specific disease or condition. Therefore, it is not included in the table as a valid entity."}
