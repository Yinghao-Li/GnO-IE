    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's the updated table with the valid entities that clearly refer to \"Disease\":\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| G (M2) gangliosidosis |\n\nThe paragraph only mentions one disease, G (M2) gangliosidosis, which is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. The term \"subacute variant of G (M2) gangliosidosis\" does not refer to a distinct disease entity, but rather describes a variant form of the disease. Therefore, I have removed it from the list of valid entities."}
