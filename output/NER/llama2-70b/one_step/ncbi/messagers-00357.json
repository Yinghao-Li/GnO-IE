Therefore, \"44 unrelated alleles\" can be considered a single entity, which is a disease or condition that is being studied.\n\nIt's worth noting that the paragraph does not explicitly mention the name of the disease or condition being studied, but based on the context, it can be inferred that the disease is genetic in nature and is associated with the mutations being discussed."},

Therefore, the only valid entity that refers to a disease or condition in the paragraph is:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| none |\n\nI apologize for the mistake in my previous response."}
