Therefore, \"HUS\" is a valid entity in the context of the paragraph.\n\nI removed \"FH\" and \"FH receptors\" from the list of entities because they do not clearly refer to a disease. \"FH\" could potentially refer to a disease, but without more context, it is unclear what specific disease is being referred to. \"FH receptors\" are not a disease, but rather a type of protein that is involved in the pathogenesis of certain diseases."}
