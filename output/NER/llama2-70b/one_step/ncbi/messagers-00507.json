Dystrophinopathy includes muscular dystrophy and other related disorders.\n\nNote: The paragraph does not explicitly mention the disease entities, but based on the context and the mention of dystrophin and muscle form, it can be inferred that the disease being referred to is muscular dystrophy or a related dystrophinopathy."},

Therefore, it is not included in the table."}
