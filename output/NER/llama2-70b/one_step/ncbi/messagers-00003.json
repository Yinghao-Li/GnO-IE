Here are the entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Sporadic T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) |\n| A-T |\n| Mature T-cell leukaemia |\n\nNote that \"A-T\" is a disease entity in the paragraph, but it is not a separate disease from \"T-PLL\". \"A-T\" is a shorthand way of referring to ataxia-telangiectasia, which is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing certain cancers, including T-PLL. Therefore, \"A-T\" is not a distinct disease entity in this context, but rather a related condition that is mentioned for comparison purposes."},
