The paragraph describes a genetic mutation that results in a missense mutation, which can cause a disease. The specific disease caused by this mutation is not specified in the paragraph, but the mention of a band shift and a missense mutation suggests that it could be a genetic disorder or disease caused by a mutation in the DNA."},
