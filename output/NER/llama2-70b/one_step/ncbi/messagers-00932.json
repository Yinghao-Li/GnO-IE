    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's the updated table with the valid disease entities:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| breast carcinomas |\n\nThe phrase \"high - grade\" is not a disease entity, but rather an adjective phrase modifying the noun \"breast carcinomas\". Similarly, \"non - inherited\" is not a disease entity, but rather an adjective phrase modifying the noun \"breast carcinomas\". Therefore, the only valid disease entity in the given paragraph is \"breast carcinomas\"."}
