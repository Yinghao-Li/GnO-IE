Therefore, it is not included in the table.\n\nThe entity \"exon 4\" is not a disease, but rather a specific part of a gene. Therefore, it is not included in the table.\n\nThe entity \"human complement C9 gene\" is not a disease, but rather a gene that is associated with a disease. Therefore, it is not included in the table."}
