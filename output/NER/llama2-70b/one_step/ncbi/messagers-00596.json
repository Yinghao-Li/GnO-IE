Here are the entities identified in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| ALD |\n| demyelination |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* ALD (Adrenoleukodystrophy) is a genetic disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is a type of demyelinating disease, which means that it causes damage to the protective covering (myelin) that surrounds nerve fibers.\n* Demyelination is the process of damage or destruction of the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. In the paragraph, the autopsy findings showed that there was massive demyelination of the cerebral white matter, which is a characteristic feature of ALD.\n\nTherefore, the two entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
