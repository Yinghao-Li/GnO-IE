The paragraph discusses the conservation of gene expression and imprinting mechanisms between mice and humans, but it does not mention any specific diseases. Therefore, the table of \"Disease\" entities would be empty:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n|  |\n\nNote that the paragraph does mention \"imprinting\" which could be related to diseases, but in this context, it refers to the process of gene expression and not a specific disease."},
