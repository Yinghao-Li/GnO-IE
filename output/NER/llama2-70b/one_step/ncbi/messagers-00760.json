    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's the updated table with the valid disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) |\n\nThe paragraph only mentions one disease entity, which is Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). Coproporphyria is not a distinct disease entity, but rather a broader term that refers to a group of diseases characterized by a deficiency of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO). Therefore, I have removed it from the list of valid disease entities.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}
