In DCM solution , PBDT-TDPP-S shows two obvious absorption peaks. The first one at ∼ 420 nm corresponds to the π-π* transition of the polymeric backbone in short wavelength region. The second one at ∼ 590 nm in long wavelength region is attributed to the ICT interaction between the donor unit in the main chain and the acceptor unit at the side chain. Compared with the absorption spectrum in DCM solution , the one in solid film displayed a red - shift absorption peak at 602 nm and an additional shoulder at 655 nm besides the highenergy peak. The extended absorption edge in long wavelength region can be attributed to the more aggregated configuration formed in solid state. Compared to the main - chain copolymer of PBDTDPP-OR reported by the Jo group , this side - chain copolymer of PBDT-TDPP-S exhibited a 100 nm blue - shifted maximum absorption peak. The observed blue - shifted absorption phenomenon should be related to the less planar conformation and weaker D-A interaction for the side - chain D-A copolymer than the main - chain D-A copolymer. As a result , the optical band gap ( E g opt ) of PBDT-TDPP-S was shifted to 1.73 eV as calculated from the onset of absorption spectra in the solid film. 2.3. Electrochemical Properties. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) curve of the PBDT-TDPP-S film coated on a platinum electrode is shown in Figure S3 ( see Supporting Information ) , and the electrochemical data are also summarized in Table 2.

Based on an empirical formula , the corresponding HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels ( E HOMO and E LUMO ) of PBDT-TDPP-S were calculated to be -5.34 and -3.52 eV , respectively. This resulting E HOMO level is lower than those of the reported mainchain D-A copolymers of PDPP - BDT ( -5.16 eV ) and PBDTPP-OR ( -5.29 eV ). 8 The relatively low E HOMO for PBDT-TDPP-S is beneficial to achieve high V OC in PSCs , given the strong correlation between the V OC and the difference between the E HOMO of donor and the E LUMO of acceptor in PSCs. 8 2.4.
