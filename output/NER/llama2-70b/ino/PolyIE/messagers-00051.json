Replacing n-dodecyl in P3 with 2-decyltetradecyl group significantly enhance solubility of P4. P5 and P6 also have good solubility. Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using polystyrene standards as calibrants.

The GPC measurements for P2 and P3 are not carried out due to their low solubility. The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) under nitrogen ( Figure 2 ).

Broad absorption bands located in the visible region were observed for the solution and film of P1 ( Figure 4 ). The absorbance maximum for P1 in solution is 496 nm. The absorption spectrum of P1 in film exhibits red - shift and distinct shoulder peak at ca. 540 nm , which are probably related to the formation of molecular aggregates owing to the strong interchain interactions. The absorption maxima of P2 in solution and in film are red - shifted 14 and 32 nm relative to that of P1 , respectively , thanks to its more planar conformation and increased conjugation. P3 and P4 exhibit almost same absorption profile in solution and in film. Compared to P1 and P2 , P3 and P4 exhibit relatively narrow and blue - shifted absorption band in solution and in film. P5 in solution and in film exhibits absorbance maxima at 503 and 524 nm , which are shifted 20 nm to the red relative to those of P4 , suggesting a more planar conformation.
