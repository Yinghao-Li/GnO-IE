Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using polystyrene standards as calibrants.

The GPC measurements for P2 and P3 are not carried out due to their low solubility.

The absorption spectrum of P1 in film exhibits red - shift and distinct shoulder peak at ca. 540 nm , which are probably related to the formation of molecular aggregates owing to the strong interchain interactions. The absorption maxima of P2 in solution and in film are red - shifted 14 and 32 nm relative to that of P1 , respectively , thanks to its more planar conformation and increased conjugation. P3 and P4 exhibit almost same absorption profile in solution and in film. Compared to P1 and P2 , P3 and P4 exhibit relatively narrow and blue - shifted absorption band in solution and in film. P5 in solution and in film exhibits absorbance maxima at 503 and 524 nm , which are shifted 20 nm to the red relative to those of P4 , suggesting a more planar conformation.
