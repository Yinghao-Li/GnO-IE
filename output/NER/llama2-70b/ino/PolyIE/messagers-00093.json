Photovoltaic Properties. The bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PCBM ( or PC 70 BM ) / LiF / Al. PEDOT : PSS was spin - coated on a precleaned ITO - coated glass substrate. The film was dried at 150 °C under a N 2 atmosphere for 5 min. After cooling the substrate , a solution of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM ( or PC 70 BM ) mixture ( 1 : 2 w / w ) was spin - coated , where a blend of chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene ( 4 : 1 v / v ) was used as the solvent. The devices were completed by evaporating LiF / Al as the cathode. The effective area ( 2 mm x 3 mm ) of the PSCs was defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light ( Scheme 2 ). PC 70 BM was also used as an acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PCBM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region , which can compensate for the poor absorption of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) in this range. Figure 6 shows the I-V curves of the devices with the best photovoltaic performance under the illumination of AM 1.5 ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). The corresponding open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short - circuit current ( I SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and PCE of the devices are also summarized in Figure 3. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the devices under the illumination of monochromatic light is shown in Figure 3.
