This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation. Additionally , compared to a single thiophene ring , it must be pointed out that due to the large resonance stabilization energy of BDT , the delocalization of electrons from the BDT unit into the backbone is less favorable than from the thiophene ring. As a result , a more stable copolymer with high performance can be obtained by using BDT as the core unit.
