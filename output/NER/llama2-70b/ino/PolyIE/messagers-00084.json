We have designed and synthesized two anthracene - based low band - gap copolymers , PTATDPP and PTAFDPP. Since the TA unit has a highly conjugated 2-D structure with a weak electron - donating nature , the copolymer composed of TA and DPP units shows a relatively low band - gap , a low - lying HOMO energy level , high crystallinity , and efficient charge transporting characteristics. The PSCs fabricated from PTATDPP and PTAFDPP with PC71BM exhibit PCEs as high as 7.02% and 5.22% , respectively. Furthermore , PTATDPP shows a promising PCE of 4.23% when a non-fullerene acceptor ( di-PBI ) is used as an electron acceptor material for the PSC device. These results not only demonstrate that thienyl-substituted anthracene is a very promising building block as an electron - donating unit of low band - gap polymers for high performance PSCs but also PTATDPP can be used as a universal electron donor material compatible with various electron acceptor materials in PSCs.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
