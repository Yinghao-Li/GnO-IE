Now, let's convert the absorption maxima wavelengths to energy units (eV):\n\n* λmax1 = 403 nm = 2.98 eV\n* λmax2 = 589 nm = 2.04 eV\n3. Finally, we can calculate the optical bandgap (Egopt) using the following formula:\n\nEgopt = (λmax1 - λmax2) / 2\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nEgopt = (2.98 eV - 2.04 eV) / 2 = 1.70 eV\n\nThis matches the value mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the material properties of PCDSeBT mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Molecular weight: Mn = 83,000 g/mol\n* Polydispersity: PDI = 2.51\n* UV-vis absorption spectra\n + Absorption maxima (λmax): 403 nm (2.98 eV) and 589 nm (2.04 eV)\n + Absorption onset: red-shifted by ∼ 70 nm compared to PCDTBT\n* Optical bandgap: Egopt = 1.70 eV"},
