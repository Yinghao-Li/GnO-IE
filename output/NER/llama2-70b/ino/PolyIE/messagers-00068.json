The PSCs based on PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than that based on PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM. With a weight ratio of PzNDTDTBO to PC71BM 1.5 : 1 , a PCE of 4.37% with V oc of 0.76 V , J sc of 10.35 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 55.5% was achieved while the devices based on PzNDTDTBT showed a relatively low PCE of 2.43% , with V oc of 0.62 V , J sc of 8.21 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 47.7% at the optimal PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ratio of 1 : 2 ( w / w ). The increased value of V oc of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs is in accordance with the decreased value of the HOMO energy level of the polymer and the higher J sc and FF could be attributed to the higher hole mobility ( 4.4 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). By addition of 1% 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) into o-DCB used for spin - coating , the PCEs of the solar cells based on PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO were improved to 3.22 and 4.63% , respectively , mostly through an increase in the FF. 25 To further improve the photovoltaic performances of the PSC devices , thermal annealing was employed. , the FF of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs increased from 62.5 to 65.5% , and consequently , the PCE increased from 4.63 to 5.07% . However , for PzNDTDTBT , the measured PCE was not improved by thermal annealing but , inversely , exhibited a slight decrease of photovoltaic values. Compared with PzNDTDTBT / PzNDTDTBO , PSCs based on PzNDTTPD shows higher V oc , which corresponds to the deepest HOMO energy level of PzNDTTPD ( see Table 2 ). . . Figure 7 shows the AFM images of the active layer surfaces.

After adding DIO , a nanoscaled fine interpenetrating network and smaller domain size of phase separation are formed , which is beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport. R a is raised from 0.27 to 1.91 nm for PzNDTDTBT and from 1.23 to 1.88 nm for PzNDTDTBO , which can explain the increase of FF of the photovoltaic devices to some degree. When the PzNDTDTBO blend film was then thermally annealed at 150 °C for 10 min , R a is further increased.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
