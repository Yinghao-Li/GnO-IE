The incorporation of an extended fused aromatic unit in the polymer backbone is expected to induce strong intermolecular interactions ( π-π stacking ) , affording high crystallinity to the polymer and thus resulting in a reduced energy barrier for charge carrier transport. Therefore , the DPP - based copolymers combined with fused heteroarenes have shown low band - gaps with excellent charge transport characteristics and thus a high short circuit current density ( J SC ) of the solar cell device. [26][27][28][29] However , since low band - gap DPP - based copolymers usually exhibit a relatively high - lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , leading to a low open circuit voltage ( V OC ) of PSCs , a compromise between the band - gap and the HOMO energy level of DPP - based polymers is critically required. One way to solve the trade - off between V OC and J SC of the PSC based on low band - gap polymers is to introduce arene groups which have weak electron - donating power. When a benzene or naphthalene group which has a weak electrondonating nature was incorporated into DPP - based copolymers , a low - lying HOMO energy level was achieved without a large sacrifice of the band - gap , and as a result PCEs were improved with enhanced V OC s as compared to the counterpart polymer with a strong electron - donating unit. 30,31 Anthracene is also an interesting building block as an electron - donating unit for low band - gap conjugated polymers , because the electron - donating power of anthracene is relatively weaker than fused heteroarenes such as thieno [3,2-b]thiophene and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene , and therefore , anthracene - based copolymers are expected to have a low - lying HOMO energy level. Furthermore , anthracene - based copolymers usually exhibit high crystallinity and high charge carrier mobility due to the coplanar fused structure of the anthracene unit. Therefore , a combination of DPP and anthracene could be ideal , thus leading to high J SC and V OC . Nevertheless , a few studies have reported that anthracene - DPP conjugated polymers show low PCEs less than 3% . 32 Here , we synthesized low band - gap copolymers incorporating 9,10-bis (5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)anthracene ( TA ) and DPP as an electron - donating and electron - withdrawing unit , respectively.
