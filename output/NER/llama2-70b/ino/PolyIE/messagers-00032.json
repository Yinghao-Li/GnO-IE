Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to investigate the redox behavior of the polymers and to determine their HOMO and LUMO energy levels. 25 CV was performed under an Ar atmosphere in a solution of TBABF 4 ( 0.10 M ) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV / s and room temperature. A platinum plate was used as a working electrode. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode , and a Ag / AgNO 3 electrode was used as the reference electrode. The HOMO energy level was determined by using oxidation onsets ( E ox ) of the polymer films. 26 The LUMO energy levels of the polymers were determined by combining the HOMO energy levels obtained from CV and the optical bandgap energies obtained from the edges of absorption. 26 To obtain the oxidation potentials of the polymer films , the reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) salt couple , whose redox potential is assumed to have an absolute energy level of -4.80 eV in a vacuum. 26 The potential of this external standard determined under the same conditions was 0.4 eV.
