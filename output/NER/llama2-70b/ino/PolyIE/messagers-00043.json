In the case of polymers , extremely limited results have been reported. 21,22 In the Takimiya group , recently , a polymer composed of QC derivatives has been reported for use in OTFTs that has a high hole mobility ( 0.2 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ). 23 In this study , we synthesized a new donor - acceptor type ( D- A type ) polymer , poly[quinacridone-alt-octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole] ( PQCDTB ) , which contained QC and octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole ( DTB ).

As shown in Table 1 , PQCDTB and PCZDTB had a 5% weight loss at the temperatures of 323 and 324 °C , respectively , displaying a high thermal stability because of the rigid QC and carbazole structure , which is applicable for optoelectronic devices and OPVs , both of which require a high thermal stability ( 300 °C or above ). 24 We investigated thermal behavior through DSC analysis ( see Supporting Information ) , which revealed no obvious thermal transitions for PQCDTB in the temperature range from 40 to 250 ° C.
