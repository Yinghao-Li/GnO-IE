Density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations was carried out to probe the molecular and electronic properties of the PffBB-n polymer by means of B3LYP / 6-311+(d,p) as a basis set in a vacuum using the repeating conjugated units of the polymer backbone in which all of the alkyl substitutions were replaced by ethyl groups to reduce the calculation time. Figure 2 displays the optimized molecular conformation and the frontier molecular orbitals of the ethyl-substituted repeating units of PffBB-n. The dihedral angle between the BDT electron - donating unit and the electron - deficient unit was found to be ∼ 26.9 ° in the optimized structure , which is caused by the ethyl substitution on the thienyl ring. The HOMO delocalizes extensively over the π-conjugation framework , whereas the LUMO mainly populated on the benzothiadiazole Article unit. Such frontier molecular orbital electron distribution would greatly enhance efficient intramolecular charge transfer. The electrochemical properties of PffBB-n were determined by cyclic voltammetry. Their results are summarized in Table 2 , and the respective energy levels are delineated in Figure 2d. The HOMO energy levels of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 were estimated from the onset oxidation potential to be -5.66 , -5.73 , -5.72 , and -5.78 eV , respectively. The corresponding LUMO energy levels were calculated from the HOMO energy level and the onset absorption of polymers in thin films , which were -4.01 , -4.11 , -4.11 , and -4.16 eV , respectively. As a result , the HOMO energy levels of PffBB-n polymers are much lower than that of ITO and their corresponding LUMO energy levels of PffBB-n lied slightly above that of PC71BM. Such energy level alignment would facilitate charge transfer from the donor polymer to the PC71BM acceptor and provide a relatively large difference between the HOMO energy level of donor polymers and the LUMO level of PC71BM , which is important to achieve a large V oc of a solar device. As a result , BHJ PSCs fabricated from these polymers are promising to achieve high device performance. X-Ray Diffraction ( XRD ). X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out to determine the crystallinity of PffBB-n polymers and the XRD spectra are shown in Figure 3. Despite various sizes of alkyl side chains attached , polymers with the same backbone show very similar XRD patterns. The sharp peaks at around 5 ° correspond to the in-plane spacing ( d 1spacing ) between the polymer backbones , whereas the broad peaks lying above 20 ° ( d 2 -spacing ) is characterized as a π-π stacking distance.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
