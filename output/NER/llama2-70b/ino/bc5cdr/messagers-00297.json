Atropine\n\nAtropine is a chemical substance that is used as a medication to treat certain medical conditions, such as bradycardia (slow heart rate). It is an anticholinergic drug, which means it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the regulation of heart rate. Atropine is a chemical entity because it is a specific, identifiable substance with a defined chemical structure.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Atropine"},
