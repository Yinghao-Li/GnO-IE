Developmental toxicity is a disease or condition caused by exposure to a toxic substance, in this case, S - 53482, and it affects the development of an organism.\n2. Oral exposure refers to the exposure of an organism to a substance through the mouth, which can cause a disease or condition.\n3. Dermal exposure refers to the exposure of an organism to a substance through the skin, which can also cause a disease or condition.\n\nTherefore, all three entities are related to the concept of disease or condition caused by exposure to a substance."},
