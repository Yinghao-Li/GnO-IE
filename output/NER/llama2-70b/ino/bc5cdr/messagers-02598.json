The response rate is measured in terms of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). The paragraph also mentions metabolic CR, which is a type of complete response that is confirmed using PET scans.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cancer (the disease being treated with GEM-P)\n2. Complete response (CR)\n3. Partial response (PR)\n4. Metabolic CR (a type of complete response)\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the conditions or states that the patients are experiencing, which are being targeted by the treatment (GEM-P)."},

The mention of metabolic CR is also related to the disease, but it is a specific type of complete response that is confirmed using PET scans, so it can be considered a subtype of complete response.\n\nTherefore, the entities that clearly refer to Disease in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
