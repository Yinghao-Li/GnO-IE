It is a serious and potentially life-threatening neurological disorder.\n2. Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus is a specific type of status epilepticus that is caused by the administration of the drug pilocarpine.\n\nTherefore, both status epilepticus and pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus can be classified as \"Disease\" or \"Disorder\" entities in the paragraph."},
