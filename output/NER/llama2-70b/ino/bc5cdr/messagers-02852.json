Tranexamic acid is a chemical compound, specifically an amino acid, that is used as a medication to treat various medical conditions, including bleeding and seizures.\n2. Doses refer to the amount of tranexamic acid administered, which is typically measured in units of weight (e.g., milligrams or grams) per unit of body weight (e.g., kilogram).\n3. kg (kilogram) is a unit of weight used to express the body weight of a patient, which is used to calculate the dose of tranexamic acid.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the drug tranexamic acid, the doses of the drug, and the unit of weight used to express the body weight of a patient."},
