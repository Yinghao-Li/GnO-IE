Acetaminophen is a chemical entity, specifically a drug, that is known to cause liver damage in high doses.\n2. Hepatotoxicity is a term used to describe the damage caused to the liver due to exposure to a toxic substance, in this case, acetaminophen.\n3. Acute liver failure (ALF) is a medical condition where the liver fails suddenly and cannot function properly, which can be caused by various factors, including acetaminophen overdose.\n\nI hope this helps!
