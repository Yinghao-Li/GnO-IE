Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and internal organs.\n2. Renal crisis is a complication of scleroderma that affects the kidneys and can lead to kidney failure.\n3. Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that can cause renal crisis in patients with scleroderma.\n4. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid drug that is often used to treat scleroderma and other autoimmune diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Scleroderma, Renal crisis, Tacrolimus, and Prednisolone."},
