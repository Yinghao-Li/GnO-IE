Intracerebral hemorrhage is a type of bleeding that occurs within the brain tissue, which can be caused by various factors, including anticoagulant medications like warfarin.\n2. Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication that works by blocking the production of clotting factors in the liver, which can increase the risk of bleeding. In this case, the patient's cutaneous exposure to warfarin led to an intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are intracerebral hemorrhage and warfarin."},
