Normoammonemic encephalopathy is a disease entity, as it is a condition characterized by abnormal brain function due to an accumulation of ammonia in the brain, which can lead to a range of neurological symptoms.\n2. Valproate-induced encephalopathy is also a disease entity, as it is a condition caused by the use of valproate, a medication used to treat seizures, bipolar disorder, and other conditions, which can cause damage to the brain and lead to neurological symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Normoammonemic encephalopathy and Valproate-induced encephalopathy."},
