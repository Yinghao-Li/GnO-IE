Identify the keywords related to disease:\n * Inflammation\n * Bladder inflammation\n * Cyclophosphamide (CYP)\n2. Identify the entities associated with the keywords:\n * Bladder inflammation:\n  + Disease\n * Cyclophosphamide (CYP):\n  + Drug\n * p75 (NTR):\n  + Receptor\n * NGF:\n  + Protein\n3. Determine the relationship between the entities:\n * Bladder inflammation is induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP).\n * p75 (NTR) is a receptor that binds to NGF.\n4. Identify the \"Disease\" entities:\n * Bladder inflammation\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
