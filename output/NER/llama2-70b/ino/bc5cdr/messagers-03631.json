Ruthenium red is a chemical compound used as a stain in histology to enhance the visibility of certain tissue structures.\n2. Lamina rara externa is a layer of extracellular material that surrounds the epithelial cells in a tissue. It is composed of various chemical components, including proteins and lipids.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Ruthenium red and the components of the lamina rara externa."},
