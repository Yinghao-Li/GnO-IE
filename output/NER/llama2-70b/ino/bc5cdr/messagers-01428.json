Lead (Pb) exposure is a disease or medical condition that can have harmful effects on the body, particularly in children.\n2. Cognitive outcomes refer to the effects of lead exposure on mental processes such as memory, attention, and learning, which can be a disease or disorder.\n3. Brain development refers to the growth and maturation of the brain, which can be affected by lead exposure.\n\nTherefore, the three entities mentioned in the paragraph can be classified as diseases or medical conditions."},
