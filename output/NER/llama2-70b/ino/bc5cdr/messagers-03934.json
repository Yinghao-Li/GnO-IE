Identify the medical condition being treated: \"propranolol therapy\"\n3. Identify the physiological changes measured: \"total peripheral resistance\" and \"cardiac output\"\n\nBased on these steps, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypertension (high blood pressure) - This is the medical condition being treated with propranolol therapy, as it is a beta blocker commonly used to lower blood pressure.\n2. Cardiovascular disease - This is a broader category that includes hypertension, as well as other conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypertension\n2. Cardiovascular disease"},
