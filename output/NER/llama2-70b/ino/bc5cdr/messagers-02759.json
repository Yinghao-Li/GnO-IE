Group P - This is a group of patients who received a certain dose of bupivacaine, so it is not a disease entity.\n2. Group C - This is a group of patients who received a different dose of bupivacaine, so it is not a disease entity.\n3. Group L - This is a group of patients who received a certain dose of bupivacaine, so it is not a disease entity.\n4. Plasma bupivacaine levels - This refers to the concentration of bupivacaine in the blood, which is not a disease entity.\n5.
