Foot-shock stress-induced increase of [35S] TBPS binding\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Isoniazid is a drug used to treat tuberculosis, and it can cause convulsions as a side effect. Therefore, isoniazid-induced convulsant activity can be considered a disease entity.\n* Foot-shock stress is a method used to induce stress in animals, and it can increase the binding of [35S] TBPS, which is a marker of synaptic plasticity. Therefore, foot-shock stress-induced increase of [35S] TBPS binding can also be considered a disease entity."},
