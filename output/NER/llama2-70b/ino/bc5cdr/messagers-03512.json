Blepharoconjunctivitis (a condition that involves inflammation of the conjunctiva and eyelids)\n2. Dry eyes (a condition characterized by a lack of adequate tears or moisture on the surface of the eye)\n3. Contact lens intolerance (a condition where the eye reacts negatively to contact lenses, leading to discomfort, redness, and irritation)\n4. Photodermatitis (a skin condition caused by an adverse reaction to light, resulting in inflammation and irritation)\n\nThese are the chemical entities in the paragraph because they are all related to chemical reactions or processes in the body. Blepharoconjunctivitis and photodermatitis are inflammatory conditions that involve chemical changes in the body, while dry eyes and contact lens intolerance are conditions that can be caused by chemical imbalances or reactions in the eye."},
