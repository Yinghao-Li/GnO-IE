IKs blockers: IKs (slow delayed rectifier potassium current) blockers are medications that block the flow of potassium ions through the IKs channel, which is also important in regulating the heart's rhythm.\n3. Ca(2+) channel blockers: Ca(2+) channel blockers are medications that block the flow of calcium ions through voltage-gated calcium channels, which are important in regulating muscle contraction and relaxation.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
