Serum sFas is a protein molecule that is present in the blood serum and plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis.\n2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is an enzyme that is found in various tissues, including the liver, heart, and skeletal muscles. It is involved in the transfer of an amino group from aspartate to Î±-ketoglutarate in the urea cycle.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are serum sFas and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)."},

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)\n\nThe term \"serum\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a fluid that contains various chemicals, including proteins and enzymes. Therefore, I have removed it from the list.\n\nThe term \"sFas\" is also not a chemical entity, as it is an abbreviation for \"soluble Fas,\" which refers to a protein molecule. However, since it is not explicitly stated that \"sFas\" is a chemical entity, I have removed it from the list as well.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity that clearly refers to a chemical substance in the paragraph is aspartate aminotransferase (AST)."},
