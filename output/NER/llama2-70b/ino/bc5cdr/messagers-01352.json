These drugs are all medications used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation, and they are being studied in relation to their potential health risks.

NS-NSAIDs\n\nExplanation:\n\nAcetaminophen is not a disease, but a medication used to treat pain and fever. Although it is mentioned in the paragraph, it is not relevant to the topic of disease.\n\nRofecoxib and celecoxib are both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. NS-NSAIDs is a term used to refer to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that are not COX-2 selective, and may also include drugs that are not NSAIDs. Therefore, all three entities can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of this paragraph."},
