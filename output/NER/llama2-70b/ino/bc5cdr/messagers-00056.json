Identify the biological process mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Apoptosis\n4. Identify the phrase that indicates the effect of the compounds on the cells:\n * \"induced apoptosis\"\n5. Identify the phrase that indicates the lack of effect of the compounds on the cells:\n * \"had no effect\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the information we have gathered:\n\n* HL60 and HBMP are cell lines.\n* NCQ436 and NCQ344 are compounds that induced apoptosis in HL60 and HBMP cells.\n* NCR181, FLA873, FLA797, FLA838, NCM001, and NCL118 are compounds that had no effect on HL60 and HBMP cells.\n* Apoptosis is a biological process that occurs in cells.\n\nBased on the information gathered, we can identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph as:\n\n* HL60 cells\n* HBMP cells\n* Apoptosis\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the two cell lines and the biological process of apoptosis."},
