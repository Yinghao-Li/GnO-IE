The paragraph describes a physiological process and a drug's effect on that process, but it does not mention any diseases.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the paragraph:\n\n* \"Spontaneous respiration\" refers to the natural process of breathing, which is a vital function of the body.\n* \"recommenced\" means started again or resumed.\n* \"200 min\" is a time period, indicating that the respiration process started again after a period of 200 minutes.\n* \"after succinylcholine administration\" indicates that the drug succinylcholine was administered before the respiration process resumed.\n\nTherefore, the entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Spontaneous respiration (a physiological process)\n* Succinylcholine (a drug)\n\nNo diseases are mentioned in the paragraph."},

It is a choline ester that works by blocking the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle paralysis.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Succinylcholine"},
