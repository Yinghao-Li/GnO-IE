Somnolence\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Somnolence refers to a state of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness, which is a symptom of a disease or disorder. In the paragraph, it is mentioned as a potential side effect of high serum concentration of citalopram in elderly patients.\n\nI hope this revised list is more accurate.
