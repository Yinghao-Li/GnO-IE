Ischemia: Ischemia is a condition where there is a reduction in blood supply to a particular tissue or organ, resulting in a lack of oxygen and nutrients. It is a disease entity.\n2. Coronary artery spasm: Coronary artery spasm is a condition where the muscles in the walls of the coronary arteries contract, reducing blood flow to the heart. It is a disease entity.\n3. Nitroglycerin: Nitroglycerin is a medication used to treat angina pectoris (chest pain) and coronary artery spasm. It is not a disease entity.\n4. Calcium blocking agents: Calcium blocking agents are medications used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure, angina pectoris, and coronary artery spasm. They are not disease entities.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ischemia\n2. Coronary artery spasm"},
