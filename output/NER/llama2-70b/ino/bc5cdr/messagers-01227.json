Pilocarpine\n\nPilocarpine is a chemical compound that is used to induce seizures in animal models of epilepsy. It is a cholinergic agonist, which means that it activates cholinergic receptors in the brain, leading to an increase in the activity of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n\nTherefore, pilocarpine can be identified as a chemical entity in the paragraph."},
