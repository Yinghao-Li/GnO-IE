Prograf is a brand name for tacrolimus, which is manufactured by Fujisawa USA, Inc. Therefore, both Tacrolimus and Prograf are chemical entities in the paragraph."},

It is the only chemical entity in the paragraph that clearly refers to a chemical substance. Prograf is a brand name for tacrolimus, but it does not provide any additional information about the chemical structure or properties of the compound, and therefore can be removed from the list of chemical entities."},
