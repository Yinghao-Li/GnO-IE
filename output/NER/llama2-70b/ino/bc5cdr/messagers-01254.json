Hepatitis B immune globulin is a medication composed of antibodies that are specific to the hepatitis B virus. It is used to prevent hepatitis B infection in people who have been exposed to the virus, and it is also used to prevent recurrence of hepatitis B in people who have already been infected.\n2. Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue that is used to treat hepatitis B infection. It works by inhibiting the replication of the hepatitis B virus.\n\nTherefore, both hepatitis B immune globulin and lamivudine are chemical entities in the paragraph."},
