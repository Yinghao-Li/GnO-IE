Vacuolation refers to the formation of vacuoles or empty spaces within cells, which can be a sign of cellular damage or disease.\n2. S-100 protein staining is a diagnostic technique used to detect the presence of certain proteins in cells, which can help identify various diseases, including cancer. The fact that there was additional vacuolation in S-100 protein staining suggests that there may be some disease or abnormality present in the cells being examined."},

S-100 protein: This is a protein that is used as a marker for certain cellular structures and is often used in immunohistochemistry staining techniques. It is a chemical entity because it is a specific molecule with a defined structure and properties.\n2. Vacuolation: This refers to the presence of vacuoles, which are small, membrane-bound structures that contain fluid or other substances. Vacuolation is a chemical entity because it describes a specific structural feature of cells that can be observed and measured."},
