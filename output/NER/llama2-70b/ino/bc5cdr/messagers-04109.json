It is a chemical entity.\n2. Bradycardia - Bradycardia is a medical condition characterized by a slow heart rate. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a physiological effect.\n3. Tachycardia - Tachycardia is a medical condition characterized by a rapid heart rate. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a physiological effect.\n4. In vitro - In vitro refers to a laboratory setting, where experiments are conducted outside of a living organism. It is not a chemical entity.\n5. In vivo - In vivo refers to a living organism, and is used to describe experiments or processes that occur within a living organism. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Bepridil\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
