To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can look for terms that refer to medical conditions or disorders.\n\nThe paragraph mentions the following possible disease entities:\n\n1. Bipolar disorder: This is a mental health condition characterized by periods of mania or hypomania, often alternating with episodes of depression.\n2. Lithium-treated bipolar normocalcemic patients: This refers to patients with bipolar disorder who are being treated with lithium and have normal calcium levels.\n3.
