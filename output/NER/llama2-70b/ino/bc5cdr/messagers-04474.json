Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n* F2 pituitaries\n* hemorrhagic phenotype\n* F344 range of mass\n2. Determine which entities are diseases:\n\n* Hemorrhagic phenotype is a disease or a symptom, so it can be considered a \"Disease\" entity.\n3. Identify the entities that are not diseases:\n\n* F2 pituitaries and F344 range of mass are not diseases, they are just quantities or measurements.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hemorrhagic phenotype"},
