It is caused by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells, which can invade and damage surrounding tissues and organs. There are several types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer. The symptoms of cancer can vary depending on the type and location of the disease, but they often include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and pain. Cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, but early detection is crucial for effective treatment.\n\nDisease entities:\n\n1. Cancer\n2. Breast cancer\n3.
