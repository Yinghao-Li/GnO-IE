Manic depression is a mental health disorder, also known as bipolar disorder, which is characterized by periods of mania or hypomania, often alternating with episodes of depression.\n2. Hyperosmolar coma is a complication of diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can lead to a coma.\n3. Nonketotic coma is a type of diabetic coma that occurs in people with diabetes mellitus, and is caused by a lack of insulin or insulin resistance, leading to high blood sugar levels and absence of ketones in the blood."},
