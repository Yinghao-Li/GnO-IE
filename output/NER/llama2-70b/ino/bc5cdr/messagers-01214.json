Hypertension is a disease characterized by abnormally high blood pressure.\n2. Ganglionic blockade is a condition where the ganglia, which are clusters of nerve cells, are blocked or damaged, leading to various symptoms.\n3. Hexamethonium is a drug that can cause ganglionic blockade.\n\nTherefore, the three entities mentioned in the paragraph that can be classified as \"Disease\" are hypertension, ganglionic blockade, and hexamethonium."},
