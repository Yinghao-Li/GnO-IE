Thalidomide is a drug that is used to treat certain medical conditions, and it is mentioned in the paragraph as a treatment that was administered to the patients.\n2. Sural SAP amplitude recovered is a medical condition that the patients had, and it is mentioned in the paragraph as something that improved after the treatment with thalidomide.
