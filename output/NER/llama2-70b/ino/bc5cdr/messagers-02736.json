P9605 and P9201 are both clinical trial identifiers, which means they are used to identify specific groups of patients who have been treated with certain drugs or therapies. In this case, the patients in the P9605 group developed leukoencephalopathy at a significantly higher rate than the patients in the P9201 group.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are leukoencephalopathy, P9605, and P9201."},
