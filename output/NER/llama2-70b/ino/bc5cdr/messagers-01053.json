Nicotine addiction: Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, and long-term use can lead to nicotine dependence.\n2. Caffeine overdose: Caffeine is a stimulant that can cause adverse effects, including overstimulation, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, when consumed in high doses.\n3. Pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures: Pentylenetetrazole is a drug that can cause seizures in animals, and it is commonly used in research to induce seizure models.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Nicotine addiction\n* Caffeine overdose\n* Pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures"},
