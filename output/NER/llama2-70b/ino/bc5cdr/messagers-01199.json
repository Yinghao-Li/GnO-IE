    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. QT interval prolongation\n2. Methadone maintenance\n3. Tertiary care center\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. QT interval prolongation is a condition where the time interval between the Q and T waves in the electrocardiogram (ECG) is longer than normal. It is a potentially life-threatening condition that can lead to irregular heart rhythms, such as torsades de pointes, and can cause sudden death.\n2. Methadone maintenance is a treatment for opioid addiction, where methadone is administered to manage withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings.\n3. Tertiary care center refers to a hospital that provides specialized medical care, usually for complex cases that require advanced medical treatment and expertise.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are QT interval prolongation and methadone maintenance, as they are both medical conditions or treatments. Tertiary care center is not a disease entity, but rather a type of medical facility that provides care for patients with complex medical conditions."},
