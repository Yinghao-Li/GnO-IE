Dithiothreitol (DTT) - a chemical compound used as a reducing agent in biochemistry and molecular biology.\n2. Trypsin - an enzyme that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids.\n3. Heat - not a chemical entity in the classical sense, but rather a form of energy that can affect the structure and function of molecules.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Dithiothreitol (DTT)\n* Trypsin\n\nI hope this helps!
