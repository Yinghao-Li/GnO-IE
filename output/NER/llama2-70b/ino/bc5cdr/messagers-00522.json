Doxorubicin - Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug that can cause damage to the heart and its mitochondria, leading to various cardiotoxic effects.\n2. Decrease in mitochondrial Ca (2+) loading capacity - A decrease in the ability of mitochondria to load calcium ions, which is essential for their proper functioning.\n3. Inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria - The inhibition of the respiratory complexes in the mitochondria of the heart, which can lead to impaired energy production and contribute to the development of heart failure.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are Doxorubicin, Decrease in mitochondrial Ca (2+) loading capacity, and Inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria."},
