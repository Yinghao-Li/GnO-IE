Ionic currents\n\nThe term \"time constants\" is not a chemical entity, as it refers to a mathematical concept used to describe the rate of a process, rather than a chemical substance or reaction. Similarly, \"deactivation\" is not a chemical entity, as it is a process that occurs in chemical reactions, but it is not a chemical substance itself.\n\nTherefore, the updated list of chemical entities in the paragraph is:\n\n1.
