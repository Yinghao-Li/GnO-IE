Homozygous Gunn rats - This is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene encoding glucuronyl transferase.\n2. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia - This is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of bilirubin in the blood, specifically the unconjugated form, which is not bound to glucuronic acid.\n3. Bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla - This is a condition where bilirubin accumulates in the kidney tissues, specifically in the renal medulla and papilla.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Homozygous Gunn rats\n* Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia\n* Bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla"},
