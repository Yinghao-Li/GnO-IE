Myocardial necrosis: Myocardial necrosis is a condition where there is cell death (necrosis) in the heart muscle (myocardium). This process can be caused by various chemical factors, such as anoxia (lack of oxygen), ischemia (reduced blood flow), or exposure to certain toxins.\n2. Histopathological examination: Histopathological examination is a diagnostic technique that involves studying tissue samples under a microscope to identify abnormalities. In this context, the chemical entities involved are likely to be dyes or stains used to enhance the visibility of tissue structures and any preservatives used to maintain the tissue samples.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myocardial necrosis (implicitly mentioned)\n2. Dyes or stains (implicitly mentioned)\n3. Preservatives (implicitly mentioned)"},
