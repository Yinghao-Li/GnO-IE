Ratio of Bcl-2/Bax\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Bcl-2 and Bax are both proteins that play a role in regulating programmed cell death (apoptosis). An imbalance in the levels of these proteins can contribute to various diseases, including cancer.\n* The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax is also a factor in determining the fate of a cell, with a higher ratio indicating a lower likelihood of apoptosis and potentially contributing to disease progression.\n\nTherefore, all three entities can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},
