Coronary vasospasm is a disease entity as it refers to a condition where the coronary arteries constrict or narrow, leading to a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle.\n2. Ischemia is a disease entity as it refers to a condition where there is a reduction in blood flow to a specific tissue or organ, in this case, the heart muscle.\n3. Cocaine-associated chest pain is not a disease entity in itself, but rather a symptom or a sign of an underlying disease or condition. However, it is mentioned in the context of the paragraph as a possible indication for a coronary CTA strategy, and therefore, it can be considered a disease entity in this context."},
