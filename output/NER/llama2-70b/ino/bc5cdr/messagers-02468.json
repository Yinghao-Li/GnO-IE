Myeloablation is a disease or medical condition that is also mentioned in the context of the potential effects of busulfan, specifically in terms of its myeloablative effects. Myeloablation refers to the destruction of the bone marrow, which can be a side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs, including busulfan."},
