Controls\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"stained microglia cells\" which implies the presence of a disease or condition that causes the microglia cells to be stained, such as a neurodegenerative disease. Additionally, the paragraph compares the number of stained microglia cells in the \"high-dose group\" to \"controls,\" suggesting that the high-dose group may have a disease or condition that affects the number of stained microglia cells. Therefore, entities 1 and 2 can be classified as \"Disease.\"\n\nEntity 3, \"controls,\" is not a disease entity as it refers to a group of individuals or samples that do not have the disease or condition being studied."},
