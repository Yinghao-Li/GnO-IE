To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph, we need to look for any mentions of medical conditions, disorders, or abnormalities that are relevant to the topic of the paragraph.\n\nHere are the possible \"Disease\" entities that can be identified in the paragraph:\n\n1. Bile salt synthesis disorder - The paragraph mentions the effects of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE) on the neutral and acidic biosynthetic pathways of bile salt (BS) synthesis, which implies that there could be a disorder or abnormality in the bile salt synthesis process that is being studied.\n2. Long-term bile diversion - The paragraph mentions rats with long-term bile diversion, which could be a medical condition or surgical procedure that affects the normal functioning of the bile salt synthesis process.\n3. Enterohepatic circulation disorder - The paragraph mentions rats with an intact enterohepatic circulation, which suggests that there could be a disorder or abnormality in the enterohepatic circulation system that is being studied.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities that can be identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Bile salt synthesis disorder\n2. Long-term bile diversion\n3. Enterohepatic circulation disorder"},
