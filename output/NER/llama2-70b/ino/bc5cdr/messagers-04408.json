Calcium is a mineral that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including muscle contraction and nerve function. In the context of the paragraph, the author is discussing the effects of these substances on animal responses. Therefore, none of these entities can be considered \"diseases.\"\n\nThe correct answer is: None of the above."},
