CK-MB MI\n2. cTnI\n\nExplanation:\n\n* CK-MB MI is a protein marker that is used to diagnose myocardial infarction (heart attack). It is a type of creatine kinase (CK) that is specific to the heart muscle.\n* cTnI is a protein marker that is also used to diagnose myocardial infarction. It is a type of troponin I that is specific to the heart muscle.\n\nBoth CK-MB MI and cTnI are chemical entities that are produced by the heart muscle and can be measured in the blood to diagnose heart attacks."},
