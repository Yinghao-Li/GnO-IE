Cancer is a disease that affects the body's cells and can spread to different parts of the body.\n2. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer that suppresses the production of blood cells in the bone marrow, making the patient more susceptible to infections.\n3. Infectious episodes refer to the occurrence of infections in the body, which can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms. In this context, the infectious episodes are a complication of the cancer treatment."},
