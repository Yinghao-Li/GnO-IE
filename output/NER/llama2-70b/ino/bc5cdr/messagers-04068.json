Asymptomatic increase in activity of junctional pacemakers\n\nThe term \"junctional pacemakers\" refers to a type of cardiac arrhythmia, which is an abnormal heart rhythm. The phrase \"asymptomatic increase in activity\" suggests that the arrhythmia is not causing any noticeable symptoms, but it is still a potentially harmful condition that requires medical attention. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity in this context."},

Verapamil\n\nVerapamil is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat various medical conditions, including hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias. It is a calcium channel blocker that works by blocking the influx of calcium ions into smooth muscle cells, which leads to relaxation of the muscles and a decrease in blood pressure.\n\n2. Junctional pacemakers\n\nJunctional pacemakers are small clusters of cells located in the atrioventricular (AV) node and the atrioventricular bundle that regulate the heart's rhythm. They are responsible for generating electrical impulses that stimulate the heart to beat at a normal rate.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Verapamil and junctional pacemakers."},
