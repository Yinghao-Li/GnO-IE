Apomorphine-induced climbing test\n\nThis test is used to assess the effectiveness of apomorphine, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, in improving motor function. The test measures the time it takes for a mouse to climb a vertical surface, which is a common behavior in mice that is affected in Parkinson's disease.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Parkinson's disease"},

Apomorphine\n\nApomorphine is a chemical compound that is used as a drug to treat Parkinson's disease. It is a dopamine receptor agonist, which means it activates dopamine receptors in the brain and can help to improve motor function in people with Parkinson's disease. In the paragraph, apomorphine is mentioned as the substance used to induce climbing behavior in the climbing test.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Apomorphine"},
