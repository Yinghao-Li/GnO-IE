Yellow phosphorus is a chemical compound with the chemical formula P4. It is a yellow solid that is highly toxic and reactive.\n2. Cholestatic refers to a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is obstructed or reduced, leading to a buildup of bile in the liver. This can cause symptoms such as jaundice, nausea, and abdominal pain.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are yellow phosphorus and cholestatic."},
