Acute liver failure is a condition where the liver fails to function properly, leading to a range of symptoms and complications. Acetaminophen-induced liver failure is a specific type of liver failure that is caused by taking too much acetaminophen, a common pain reliever and fever reducer.\n\nI hope this helps!
