Palmoplantar pustulosis is a chronic skin condition characterized by pustules on the palms and soles. It is not an infectious disease, but rather a chronic inflammatory condition.\n2. Fever is a symptom of an underlying infection or inflammation.\n3. Myalgias refer to muscle pain, which can be a symptom of various diseases or conditions.\n4. Polyneuropathy is a term that refers to damage to multiple nerves, which can cause a range of symptoms including pain, numbness, and weakness.\n5. Testicular pain can be a symptom of various conditions affecting the testicles, such as epididymitis or orchitis.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the conditions or symptoms that are mentioned as being present in the patient: palmoplantar pustulosis, fever, myalgias, polyneuropathy, and testicular pain."},
