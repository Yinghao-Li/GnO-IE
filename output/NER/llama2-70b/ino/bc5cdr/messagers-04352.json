The guide tubes and catheters are made of materials such as plastic, metal, or silicone, which are chemical compounds that are synthesized in a laboratory.\n\nIt's important to note that while these entities are chemical in nature, they are not necessarily harmful or toxic. They are used in medical procedures to help monitor and treat various medical conditions, and they are designed to be safe and biocompatible."},
