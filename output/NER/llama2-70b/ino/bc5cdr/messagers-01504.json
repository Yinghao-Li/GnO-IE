Neuropathology is a disease entity as it refers to the study of the structure and function of the nervous system, including diseases that affect it.\n3. Time-course of changes in neurons and astrocytes is not a disease entity in itself, but it is related to the study of the progression of a disease or condition that affects neurons and astrocytes. Therefore, it is a disease entity in the context of the paragraph."},

Neurons\n4. Astrocytes\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Immunohistochemical techniques involve the use of chemicals to detect specific proteins or other molecules in tissue samples.\n2. Antibodies are chemical molecules that bind to specific antigens, and are often used in immunohistochemical techniques to detect specific proteins.\n3. Neurons and astrocytes are types of cells that are found in the nervous system, and are composed of various chemical molecules such as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates.\n\nI hope this helps!
