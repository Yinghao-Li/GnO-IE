Harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs)\n\nExplanation:\n\nInorganic arsenic (iAs) is a toxic substance that can cause health problems when ingested in large quantities. Prolonged exposure to high levels of iAs can lead to various health issues, including poisoning, cancer, and other diseases. Therefore, \"inorganic arsenic (iAs)\" and \"harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs)\" can both be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},

Harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs)\n\nThe term \"inorganic arsenic (iAs)\" is still present in the paragraph, but it's not directly related to disease. It's a reference to the substance that can cause harm when consumed in large quantities. The term \"harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs)\" is the one that specifically implies the negative health effects of exposure to this substance, and therefore it's the only entity that clearly refers to disease."},
