The paragraph discusses the prolongation of the isovolumic relaxation period after stress, which is a physiological response. Therefore, there are no chemical substances or molecules mentioned in the paragraph that would qualify as \"Chemical\" entities.\n\nHowever, if you intended to ask about the chemical substances that may be involved in the physiological response to stress, some examples include:\n\n1. Hormones: Stress hormones such as cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline play a crucial role in the body's response to stress.\n2. Neurotransmitters: Neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine are involved in mood regulation and can be affected by stress.\n3. Inflammatory mediators: Stress can trigger an inflammatory response, which involves the release of chemical mediators such as cytokines and eicosanoids.\n4. Antioxidants: Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, and enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, help protect cells from oxidative damage caused by stress.\n\nPlease note that these are just a few examples, and many other chemical substances may be involved in the body's response to stress."},
