Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland and play a crucial role in the body's response to stress. They are chemical entities that can be administered to patients through various routes, such as oral, topical, or intravenous.\n2. Ocular hypertension is a condition where the pressure inside the eye is elevated above normal levels. It is a chemical entity in the sense that it is a physiological parameter that can be measured and is affected by various factors, including the administration of glucocorticoids.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the glucocorticoids that are administered to patients and the ocular hypertension that results from their administration."},

Glucocorticoids\n\nThe paragraph only mentions one chemical entity, which is glucocorticoids. Ocular hypertension is not a chemical entity, but rather a physiological condition that can be caused by the administration of glucocorticoids."},
