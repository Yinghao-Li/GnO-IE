Cardiovascular signs are symptoms or indicators of a disease or condition that affects the cardiovascular system. In this paragraph, the cardiovascular signs are not explicitly mentioned, but they are implied as the effects that the beta-adrenergic antagonist medications may have masked.\n2. Unintentional intravascular administration of levobupivacaine with epinephrine is a medical condition that occurred as a result of a mistake or accident during a medical procedure.
