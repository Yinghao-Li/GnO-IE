Sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias refers to a type of abnormal heart rhythm that originates in the ventricles and is sustained for a period of time. This is a disease entity as it is a deviation from the normal heart rhythm and can cause symptoms and complications.\n2. Proarrhythmia refers to a condition where a drug or other intervention that is intended to restore a normal heart rhythm actually causes an abnormal heart rhythm instead. This is a disease entity as it is a negative side effect of a treatment and can cause harm to the patient."},
