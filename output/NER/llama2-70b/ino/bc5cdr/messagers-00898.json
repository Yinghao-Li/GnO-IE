Sotalol\n\nSotalol is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat certain heart rhythm disorders. It is a beta-blocker, which means it blocks the effects of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) on the heart.\n\n2. Dilated cardiomyopathy\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and the heart chambers become enlarged. It is a chemical change in the heart muscle that can lead to various complications, including coronary spasm.\n\n3. Sustained ventricular tachycardia\n\nSustained ventricular tachycardia is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that originates in the ventricles. It is a chemical imbalance in the heart that can lead to serious complications, including cardiac arrest.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Sotalol\n2. Dilated cardiomyopathy\n3. Sustained ventricular tachycardia"},
