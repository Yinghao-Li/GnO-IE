Nephrotoxicity refers to the damage caused to the kidneys due to exposure to certain substances, such as drugs or chemicals. It is a disease entity as it is a condition that affects the normal functioning of the kidneys.\n2. VCM-induced nephrotoxicity is a specific type of nephrotoxicity that is caused by exposure to vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). It is also a disease entity as it is a harmful effect of VCM on the kidneys."},
