Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) - This is the name of the insecticide, which is a chemical compound.\n2. Gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane - This is the chemical formula for Lindane. It indicates the structure of the molecule, which consists of a cyclohexane ring with six chlorine atoms attached to it.\n3. Organochlorine - This is a class of chemical compounds that contain carbon and chlorine atoms. Lindane is an example of an organochlorine insecticide.\n4. Neurotoxic - This refers to the ability of a substance to damage or disrupt the functioning of the nervous system. Lindane has been found to have neurotoxic effects.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane)\n* Gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane\n* Organochlorine\n* Neurotoxic"},
