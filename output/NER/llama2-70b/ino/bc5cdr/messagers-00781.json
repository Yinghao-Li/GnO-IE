Risk is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, and it is a chemical entity because it is a quantitative value that can be measured and studied.\n2. Patients are individuals who are participating in a clinical trial or study, and they are chemical entities because they are human beings with unique physical and biochemical properties.\n3. Cardiac history refers to the presence or absence of heart disease in the patients being studied, and it is a chemical entity because it is a characteristic that can be measured and studied.\n4. Cardiac diseases are medical conditions that affect the heart, and they are chemical entities because they are composed of chemical compounds and can be studied using chemical methods.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Risk, Patients, Cardiac history, and Cardiac diseases."},
