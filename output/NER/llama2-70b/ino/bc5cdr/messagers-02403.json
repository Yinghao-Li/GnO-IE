Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n* AChE (acetylcholinesterase)\n* BPA (bisphenol A)\n* mice\n* control mice\n* hippocampus\n* prefrontal cortex\n* hypothalamus\n* cerebellum\n2. Determine which entities are related to disease:\n\n* BPA is a chemical that has been linked to various health problems, including neurological disorders.\n* Decreased AChE activity in the hippocampus is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n3. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* BPA\n* Decreased AChE activity in the hippocampus\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are BPA and decreased AChE activity in the hippocampus, which are related to neurological disorders."},
