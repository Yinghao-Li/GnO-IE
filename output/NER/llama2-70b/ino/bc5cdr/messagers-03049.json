Drugs: The paragraph talks about detecting EAD (Early Afterdepolarization) for drugs with TdP potential. Therefore, drugs are the chemical entities being referred to in the paragraph.\n2. TdP potential: Torsades de Pointes is a type of ventricular arrhythmia that can be caused by certain drugs. The paragraph mentions drugs with TdP potential, which refers to the ability of a drug to cause this type of arrhythmia. TdP potential is a chemical property of the drug, and therefore, it is a chemical entity in the paragraph."},
