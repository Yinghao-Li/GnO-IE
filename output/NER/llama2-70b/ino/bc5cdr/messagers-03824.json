It is a soft, silvery-white alkaline earth metal that is not found in its elemental form in nature. In the paragraph, barium is mentioned as the substance to which the rats were exposed.\n\n2. Myocardial energy metabolism\n\nMyocardial energy metabolism refers to the various chemical reactions that occur in the heart muscle to produce energy for the contraction and relaxation of the heart. In the paragraph, myocardial energy metabolism is mentioned as being disturbed in the barium-exposed rats.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are barium and myocardial energy metabolism."},
