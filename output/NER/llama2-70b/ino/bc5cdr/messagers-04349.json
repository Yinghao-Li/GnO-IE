However, cardiac hypertrophy can be a symptom or a condition that can lead to various cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.\n\nTherefore, while cardiac hypertrophy is not explicitly mentioned as a disease in this paragraph, it can be considered a disease entity in the context of cardiovascular health."},
