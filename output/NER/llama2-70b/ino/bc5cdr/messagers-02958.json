Glucocorticoid: Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland and play a crucial role in the body's response to stress. In the context of the paragraph, glucocorticoid is mentioned as a substance that can induce glaucoma.\n2. ER stress: ER stress refers to stress or strain on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is a type of organelle found in cells. In the context of the paragraph, ER stress is mentioned as a factor that contributes to the development of glaucoma.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
