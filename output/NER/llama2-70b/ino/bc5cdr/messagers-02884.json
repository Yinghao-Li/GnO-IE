QT intervals: QT intervals refer to the time interval between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in an electrocardiogram (ECG). It is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat.\n2. Torsade de pointes: Torsade de pointes is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that can occur due to various factors, including certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, or underlying heart conditions. It is characterized by a specific pattern of QT interval prolongation and sudden, brief changes in the heart's electrical activity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. QT intervals\n2. Torsade de pointes"},
