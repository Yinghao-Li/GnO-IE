Controlled hypotension anesthesia\n4. Propofol\n5. Remifentanil\n6. TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Normotensive refers to patients with normal blood pressure, which is a disease entity in the context of anesthesia management.\n2. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I - II is a classification system used to assess the fitness of patients for anesthesia, with ASA I representing patients who are healthy and ASA II representing patients with mild systemic disease.\n3. Controlled hypotension anesthesia is a technique used to deliberately lower blood pressure during surgery, which can be a disease entity in certain contexts.\n4. Propofol and remifentanil are both anesthetic agents that can be used to induce and maintain anesthesia, but they can also have adverse effects on certain patients, making them disease entities in some cases.\n5. TIVA is a technique that uses intravenous drugs to induce and maintain anesthesia, which can be associated with certain risks and complications, making it a disease entity in some contexts."},
