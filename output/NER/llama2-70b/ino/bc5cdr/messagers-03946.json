Isoproterenol-induced tachycardia - This is a specific type of tachycardia that is induced by the administration of isoproterenol, a medication that stimulates the heart to beat faster.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Tachycardia\n* Isoproterenol-induced tachycardia"},
