Creatine kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in muscle physiology, and its level in the blood is often used as a diagnostic marker for muscle damage. It is a chemical entity because it is a specific substance with a defined chemical structure.\n2. IU (International Units) is a unit of measurement used to express the activity of enzymes, hormones, and other biological molecules. It is a chemical entity because it is a standardized unit used to quantify the amount of a specific substance.\n3. L (Liters) is a unit of volume used to express the amount of a substance in a given volume. It is a chemical entity because it is a standardized unit used to quantify the amount of a specific substance.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are creatine kinase, IU, and L."},
