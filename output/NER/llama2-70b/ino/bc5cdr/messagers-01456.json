    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mitral annular dimensions\n2. Commissure\n3. Septal\n4. Lateral\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Mitral annular dimensions refer to the size and shape of the mitral valve annulus, which is the ring-like structure that surrounds the mitral valve.\n* Commissure refers to the point where the mitral valve leaflets meet and join together.\n* Septal refers to the septum, which is the wall that separates the right and left sides of the heart.\n* Lateral refers to the side of the heart, specifically the left side.\n\nIn the paragraph, MAP (mitral annular plane) is mentioned as decreasing the mitral annular dimensions in both commissure-commissure and septal-lateral directions. This suggests that the mitral valve annulus is becoming smaller in both the sagittal and coronal planes, which could be indicative of a cardiac condition such as mitral valve disease or heart failure."},
