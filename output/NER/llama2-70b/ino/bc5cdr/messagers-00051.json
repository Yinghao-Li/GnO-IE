(S) - ( - ) - 3 - bromo - N - [ (1 - ethyl - 2 - pyrrolidinyl) methyl] - 2,6 - dimethoxybenzamide: This is the chemical structure of remoxipride, which includes several chemical entities:\n\na. Bromine (Br): A halogen atom.\nb. Methyl (CH3): An alkyl group.\nc. Ethyl (C2H5): An alkyl group.\nd. Pyrrolidinyl (C4H7N): A heterocyclic ring.\ne. Dimethoxy (C4H7O2): A functional group consisting of two methoxy (CH3O) groups.\nf.
