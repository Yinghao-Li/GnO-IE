Methoxamine is a chemical compound that is being studied for its effect on maximum urethral pressure in women with genuine stress incontinence. It is a medication that is used to treat high blood pressure and has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the urinary system.\n2. Placebo is a dummy treatment that has no active ingredients but is administered to a control group in a clinical trial to compare the effects of the actual treatment (methoxamine) with a group that is not receiving any treatment.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are methoxamine and placebo."},
