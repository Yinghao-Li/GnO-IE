Kidney function refers to the ability of the kidneys to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood, which can be affected by certain medical conditions or diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the cessation of TDF and kidney function, as they are both related to medical conditions or diseases."},
