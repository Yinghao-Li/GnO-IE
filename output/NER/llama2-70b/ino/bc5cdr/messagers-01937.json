    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Coronary stenosis\n2. Coronary stenosis > or = 50 %\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Coronary stenosis is a condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, become narrowed or blocked.\n* The phrase \"> or = 50%\" indicates that the stenosis is equal to or greater than 50% blockage, which is a significant level of blockage that can lead to serious health problems.\n\nTherefore, both \"Coronary stenosis\" and \"Coronary stenosis > or = 50%\" can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's the revised list of \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. Coronary stenosis > or = 50%\n\nThe phrase \"coronary stenosis\" itself refers to a disease or condition, and the additional specification of \"> or = 50%\" indicates the severity of the condition, which is relevant to the disease.\n\nTherefore, the revised list only includes the entity \"Coronary stenosis > or = 50%\", which clearly refers to a disease or condition."},
