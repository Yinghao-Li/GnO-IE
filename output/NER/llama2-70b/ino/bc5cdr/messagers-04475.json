Hemorrhagic F2 pituitaries are a type of pituitary tumor that can cause various symptoms, including hemorrhage, due to their location and size.\n2. Massive pituitaries refer to pituitary tumors that are larger in size and can cause various symptoms, including vision loss, headaches, and hormonal imbalances.\n\nIn the paragraph, both \"hemorrhagic F2 pituitaries\" and \"massive pituitaries\" are mentioned as diseases or medical conditions."},
