ST-segment depression\n\nST-segment depression is a measure of the electrical activity of the heart, specifically the segment of the electrocardiogram (ECG) that represents the depolarization of the ventricles. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a physiological measure.\n\n3. MI\n\nMI stands for myocardial infarction, which is a medical term for a heart attack. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition.\n\n4. ANT-MI\n\nANT-MI stands for anterior myocardial infarction, which refers to a heart attack that affects the anterior (front) wall of the heart. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition.\n\n5. INF-MI\n\nINF-MI stands for inferior myocardial infarction, which refers to a heart attack that affects the inferior (lower) wall of the heart. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Dipyridamole"},
