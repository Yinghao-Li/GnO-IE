Leukoencephalopathy\n2. Central Nervous System (CNS) - directed therapy (P9605)\n\nLeukoencephalopathy is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, characterized by the degeneration of white matter. It is a type of neurodegenerative disorder.\n\nOn the other hand, P9605 is not a disease but a treatment or therapy that is directed towards the central nervous system. It is a code number that refers to a specific treatment regimen for a certain condition, in this case, likely leukoencephalopathy.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Leukoencephalopathy\n\nI hope this helps!"},
