Ureteric calculi refers to the presence of stones in the ureter, which is a disease.\n2. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a viral infection that weakens the immune system and makes the body more susceptible to various diseases.\n3. Urolithiasis is the condition of having stones in the urinary tract, which is a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Ureteric calculi, HIV, and Urolithiasis."},
