    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph:\n\n1. Bladder pressure - volume curve\n2. Maximum voiding pressure (MVP)\n3. Maximum cystometric capacity (MCC)\n\nThese three entities are related to the chemical properties and reactions that occur in the bladder and urinary system. The bladder pressure-volume curve represents the relationship between the pressure and volume of the bladder, which is influenced by the chemical properties of the urine and the muscles that control the bladder. Maximum voiding pressure (MVP) is the highest pressure generated by the bladder muscles during urination, and maximum cystometric capacity (MCC) is the maximum amount of urine that can be stored in the bladder. Both MVP and MCC are important indicators of bladder function and can be used to diagnose and manage urinary disorders."},
