Troponin I is a protein that regulates muscle contraction and is released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged. It is commonly used as a biomarker for myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n2. Gadolinium is a chemical element used as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance the visibility of certain tissues or structures. In the context of the paragraph, \"gadolinium contrast enhancement\" refers to the use of gadolinium to enhance the visibility of the heart muscle during an MRI scan."},
