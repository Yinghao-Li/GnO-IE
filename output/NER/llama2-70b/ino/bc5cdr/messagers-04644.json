It is a disease characterized by the proliferation of immature white blood cells called promyelocytes.\n* ATRA is a drug used to treat APL. It is a derivative of vitamin A that helps to induce differentiation in immature cells and is used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents to treat APL.\n\nTherefore, both APL and ATRA are disease entities in the paragraph."},
