Hepatic failure is a disease condition where the liver fails to function properly, leading to severe damage or death.\n2. Phenytoin administration refers to the use of the drug phenytoin, which is an anticonvulsant medication. In this context, it is likely that the patient was taking phenytoin to treat a seizure disorder, and the adverse reaction to the drug led to the development of hepatic failure."},
