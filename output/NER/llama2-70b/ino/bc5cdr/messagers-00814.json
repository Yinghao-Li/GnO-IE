Structural abnormalities refer to changes in the physical structure of the brain that can occur as a result of using methamphetamine. These changes can be considered a disease because they can disrupt normal brain function and lead to negative effects on cognition, behavior, and mental health.\n2. Methamphetamine use is a disease because it is a chronic and often relapsing condition that can cause changes in the brain and body, leading to negative consequences such as addiction, cognitive impairment, and increased risk of psychiatric disorders.\n\nTherefore, both structural abnormalities and methamphetamine use can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},
