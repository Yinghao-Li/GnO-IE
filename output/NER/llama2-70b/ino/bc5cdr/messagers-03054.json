Cesarean section: This is a surgical procedure that involves the use of chemicals, specifically anesthetics and disinfectants, to ensure a safe and sterile environment for the mother and fetus.\n2. External alterations: This refers to changes in the physical appearance of the fetus, which can include chemical changes such as skin discoloration or swelling.\n3. Visceral alterations: This refers to changes in the internal organs of the fetus, which can include chemical changes such as changes in the composition of body fluids or abnormalities in the functioning of organs.\n4. Skeletal alterations: This refers to changes in the bones and cartilage of the fetus, which can include chemical changes such as abnormalities in bone development or mineralization.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Anesthetics\n* Disinfectants\n* Skin discoloration\n* Body fluids\n* Organ function\n* Bone development\n* Mineralization"},
