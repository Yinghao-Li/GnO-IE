The paragraph mentions the measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) and superoxide production in these regions, which suggests that the study is focused on oxidative stress and its role in neurodegeneration. Therefore, the mention of these brain regions implies the presence of disease."},
