Doses are the amounts of a drug or other chemical substance administered to a patient.\n2. Hepatic hypoperfusion refers to a decrease in blood flow to the liver, which can affect the metabolism of drugs and other chemical substances.\n3. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, which can affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs.\n4. Renal dysfunction refers to impaired kidney function, which can affect the excretion of drugs and other chemical substances from the body.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in this paragraph are the drugs or other chemical substances that are being administered to patients, as well as the conditions that can affect their metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics."},
