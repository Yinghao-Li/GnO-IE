Clonidine is a chemical substance that is known to induce bradycardia (slowing of the heart rate). It is a medication that is used to treat high blood pressure, anxiety, and other conditions.\n2. Bilateral vagotomy refers to the surgical removal or cutting of the vagus nerve, which is a nerve that runs from the brain to various organs in the body, including the heart.\n3. Spinal transection refers to the surgical cutting or severing of the spinal cord, which is a bundle of nerve tissue that runs down the spine and carries messages between the brain and the rest of the body.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are clonidine, bilateral vagotomy, and spinal transection."},
