P < . 01 and P ≤ . 01 are statistical measures used to determine the significance of the results. They are used to compare the difference in the incidence of seizures and death between the two groups.\n2. These values are not chemical entities in the classical sense, but they are used in statistical analysis, which is a branch of chemistry.
