Amiodarone\n\nAmiodarone is a chemical compound that is used as a drug to treat various types of arrhythmias. It is a class III antiarrhythmic drug, which means it works by blocking the sodium channels in the heart muscle cells, thereby slowing down the heart rate and restoring a normal heart rhythm. Amiodarone has a complex chemical structure, consisting of a benzofuran ring and a long alkyl chain. It is synthesized through a multi-step process that involves the reaction of several chemical precursors.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Amiodarone."},

Therefore, they are not included in the table."}
