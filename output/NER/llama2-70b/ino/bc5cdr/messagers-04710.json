Lithium-induced diabetes insipidus\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Hyperglycaemia is a condition of high blood sugar levels, which can be a sign of diabetes or other metabolic disorders.\n2. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare disorder that affects the kidneys' ability to regulate fluid levels in the body. It is different from diabetes mellitus, which is a disorder that affects blood sugar levels.\n3. Lithium-induced diabetes insipidus is a rare side effect of lithium medication, which can cause NDI.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are hyperglycaemia, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and lithium-induced diabetes insipidus."},

It is a type of diabetes insipidus, which is a group of disorders that cause the body to lose too much water.\n2.
