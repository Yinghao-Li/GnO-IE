Motor impairment refers to a loss or abnormality in the functioning of motor skills, which can be a symptom of various neurological disorders.\n2. DA lesion refers to damage or destruction of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, which can lead to various movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease.\n3. Dyskinesias refer to involuntary, abnormal movements that can be a side effect of certain medications, such as L-DOPA, used to treat movement disorders like Parkinson's disease."},
