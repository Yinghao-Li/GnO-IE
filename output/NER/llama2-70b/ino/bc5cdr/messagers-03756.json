Therefore, \"plasma\" is not a chemical entity in this context.\n\n\"Electrolytes\" are chemical substances that dissolve in water and conduct electricity. They are essential for various physiological processes, such as maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contractions.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
