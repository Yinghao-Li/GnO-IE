Streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impairment\n\nI have removed the entity \"glial activation\" as it does not directly refer to a disease, but rather a biological process that may be involved in the pathophysiology of certain diseases. Similarly, \"post synaptic toxicity\" has also been removed as it is not a disease entity, but rather a term that describes a type of cellular damage that can occur in various diseases."},
