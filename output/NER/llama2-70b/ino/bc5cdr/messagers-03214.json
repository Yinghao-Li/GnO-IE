Protein expression\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Serum and urinary are both chemical substances, as they are composed of various chemical compounds.\n2. Kidney tissue is composed of various chemical compounds, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and other biomolecules.\n3. Gene expression and protein expression are not chemical entities in themselves, but they are related to chemical processes, as they involve the synthesis and regulation of chemical compounds (genes and proteins) within cells.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Serum\n2. Urinary\n3. Kidney tissue\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
