Essential hypertension: This is a disease entity, as it refers to a medical condition characterized by abnormally high blood pressure.\n2. Mean sitting diastolic BP (MSDBP): This is a measurement entity, as it refers to a quantitative value used to assess blood pressure.\n3. Hypertension: This is a disease entity, as it is a synonym for high blood pressure.\n4. VAL: This is a drug entity, as it refers to a specific medication used to treat hypertension.\n5. HCTZ: This is a drug entity, as it refers to a specific medication used to treat hypertension.\n6. VAL / HCTZ: This is a drug entity, as it refers to a combination of the two medications VAL and HCTZ used to treat hypertension.\n7. Placebo: This is a drug entity, as it refers to a dummy treatment with no active ingredients, used as a control in clinical trials.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Essential hypertension\n2. Hypertension\n\nThe drug entities are:\n\n1. VAL\n2. HCTZ\n3. VAL / HCTZ\n4. Placebo"},
