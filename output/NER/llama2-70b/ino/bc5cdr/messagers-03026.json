Argatroban and alteplase are both chemical drugs used in the treatment of the patient.\n2. Renal amyloidosis is a disease characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure. It is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, but rather a disease caused by misfolded proteins.\n3. SVC syndrome, or superior vena cava syndrome, is a condition caused by the obstruction of the superior vena cava, a major vein that carries blood from the head, neck, and upper limbs to the heart. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition.\n4. HITT, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, is a condition caused by the use of heparin, a blood thinner, which can cause a drop in platelet count and the formation of blood clots. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition caused by the use of a chemical drug.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entities in the paragraph are argatroban and alteplase."},
