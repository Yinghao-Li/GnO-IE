Central nervous system toxicity is a disease entity as it refers to the harmful effects of a substance on the central nervous system, which can cause a range of neurological problems.\n\nThe other entity mentioned in the paragraph, \"behavioral toxicity,\" is not a disease entity as it does not clearly refer to a specific disease or medical condition. It is a broader term that refers to the harmful effects of a substance on an organism's behavior, which can be a symptom of various diseases or conditions."},
