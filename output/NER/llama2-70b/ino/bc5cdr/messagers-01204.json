NO (nitric oxide)\n\nExplanation: NO is a chemical compound that plays a role in the regulation of blood flow and blood pressure. It is a small molecule that is produced endogenously by the body and acts as a signaling molecule to cause vasodilation.\n\n2. Vasodilator\n\nExplanation: A vasodilator is a chemical substance that causes blood vessels to dilate, which can help to lower blood pressure. In the context of the paragraph, the term \"vasodilator activity\" refers to the ability of a substance to cause vasodilation.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are NO and vasodilator."},
