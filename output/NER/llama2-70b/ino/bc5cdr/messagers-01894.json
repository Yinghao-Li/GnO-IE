Metabolic drug interaction\n\nThe interaction between flecainide and paroxetine, which the patient had been taking for more than 5 years, was considered a metabolic drug interaction. This refers to a potential problem that can occur when two or more drugs interact with each other in a way that affects the body's metabolism, which can lead to adverse effects or reduced efficacy of the drugs. In this case, the interaction between flecainide and paroxetine may have been a concern because both drugs are metabolized by the same enzyme, which could lead to increased levels of one or both drugs in the body and potentially harmful effects."},
