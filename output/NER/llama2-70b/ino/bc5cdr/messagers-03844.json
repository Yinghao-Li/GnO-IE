Glomerular sclerosis (GS) - This is a medical condition that affects the kidneys and is characterized by the hardening of the glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. GS is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, but it is often used as a disease marker in medical research.\n2. PAN rats - PAN stands for \"puromycin-aminonucleoside\" rats, which are a type of rat that has been genetically engineered to develop glomerular sclerosis. PAN rats are often used as an animal model in medical research to study the progression and treatment of kidney diseases.\n3. Glomeruli - Glomeruli are the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. They are a key component of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Glomerular sclerosis\n2. PAN rats\n3. Glomeruli"},
