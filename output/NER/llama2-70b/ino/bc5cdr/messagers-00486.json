Angioography is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the blood vessels and diagnose various cardiovascular conditions. It is not a disease entity.\n2. cTnI-positive refers to the presence of cardiac troponin I, a protein released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged. The presence of cTnI in the blood can indicate myocardial infarction (heart attack) or other cardiac conditions. cTnI-positive is not a disease entity.\n3. Significant disease is a term used to describe the presence of a disease or condition that is considered important or noteworthy. In this context, significant disease refers to the presence of a cardiovascular condition that was detected by angiography in 25 of the 29 patients who underwent the procedure. Therefore, significant disease is a disease entity in this paragraph."},
