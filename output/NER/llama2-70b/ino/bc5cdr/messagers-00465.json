Persistent sterile leukocyturia is a disease condition characterized by the presence of sterile leukocytes in the urine for at least 2 consecutive visits.\n2. Leukocyturia is a condition where there is an abnormal increase in the number of white blood cells in the urine.\n\nTherefore, both persistent sterile leukocyturia and leukocyturia can be considered as disease entities in the paragraph."},
