Myocardial ischemia - This is a condition where the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen, leading to chest pain or discomfort, and can potentially lead to a heart attack.\n2. Partial coronary stenosis - This is a narrowing of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. It can cause myocardial ischemia and increase the risk of a heart attack.\n3. Nifedipine - This is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and angina (chest pain).\n4. Diltiazem - This is also a medication used to treat high blood pressure and angina.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Myocardial ischemia\n* Partial coronary stenosis\n\nI hope this helps!
