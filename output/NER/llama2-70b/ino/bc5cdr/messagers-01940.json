It is a serious medical condition that can have long-term consequences and is therefore considered a disease.\n\nThe other two entities, \"cocaine intoxication\" and \"alcohol intoxication,\" are not diseases in themselves, but rather substance use disorders that can increase the risk of developing various health problems, including diseases.
