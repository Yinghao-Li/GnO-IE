Melphalan\n\nMelphalan is a chemical compound that is used as a chemotherapy drug to treat certain types of cancer. It is a type of alkylating agent that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, which leads to cell death.\n\n2. Active urinary sediment\n\nUrinary sediment refers to the solid particles that are present in urine. The term \"active\" in this context suggests that the sediment is not just passively present in the urine, but is actively contributing to the development of renal injury. The exact nature of the active urinary sediment is not specified in the paragraph, but it could potentially include chemicals or other substances that are produced as a result of tubular injury."},
