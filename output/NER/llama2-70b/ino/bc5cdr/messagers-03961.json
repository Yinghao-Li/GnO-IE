Symptomatology refers to the study of symptoms, which are subjective or objective indications of a disease or medical condition.\n2. Physical examination is a method used by healthcare professionals to evaluate a patient's health status, including checking for signs of disease or abnormalities.\n3. Plate thermography is a diagnostic technique that uses thermal imaging to detect and analyze temperature changes in the body, which can be indicative of certain diseases or medical conditions.\n\nTherefore, all three entities - symptomatology, physical examination, and plate thermography - are related to the detection and diagnosis of diseases, and can be considered \"Disease\" entities."},
