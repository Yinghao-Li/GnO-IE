Protein is a macromolecule made up of amino acids, which is a chemical compound.\n3. Prostheses are medical devices used to replace or support a damaged or missing body part. Although not a chemical compound, prostheses are made of materials such as metals, plastics, or ceramics, which are chemical substances.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are VIP, protein, and prostheses."},
