The depressed excitability of the cardiac conduction system and the preference for the atrioventricular nodal region are both indicative of a disease or disorder affecting the heart."},

Barium\n\nBarium is a chemical element with the symbol Ba and atomic number 56. It is a soft, silvery-white alkaline earth metal that is used in a wide range of applications, including medicine, where it is used as a contrast agent in medical imaging. In the paragraph, barium is mentioned as the substance that was used to expose the rats, and it is therefore a chemical entity."},

Barium\n\nThe mention of \"barium\" is the only clear reference to a chemical substance in the paragraph. The term \"atrial\" refers to the heart's atrium, and \"nodal\" refers to a node or cluster of cells, but neither of these terms directly refers to a chemical entity. Therefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is barium."},
