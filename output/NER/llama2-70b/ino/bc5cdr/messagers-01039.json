Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is focused on the correlation between GAP43 expression and MFS (Molten Fractal Spectrum).\n2. Identify the experimental conditions: The paragraph mentions that the rats were subjected to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine (Pilo) and that some rats were previously injected with cycloheximide (CHX).\n3. Identify the entities related to the experimental conditions: The entities related to the experimental conditions are status epilepticus, pilocarpine, and cycloheximide.\n4. Identify the entities related to the main topic: The entities related to the main topic are GAP43 expression and MFS.\n5. Identify the \"Disease\" entities: Among the entities identified, the \"Disease\" entities are status epilepticus and MFS.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Status epilepticus\n2. MFS (Molten Fractal Spectrum)"},
