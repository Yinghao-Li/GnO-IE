Seizure: A seizure is a temporary disturbance in brain function that can cause a variety of physical and mental symptoms.\n2. Seizure susceptibility: Seizure susceptibility refers to the likelihood of an individual experiencing seizures, which can be influenced by various factors such as genetics, environmental factors, and medical conditions.\n3. Neonatal injections of MSG (4 mg/g and 1 mg/g): MSG (monosodium glutamate) is a flavor enhancer commonly used in food. In this context, neonatal injections of MSG refer to the administration of MSG to newborn mice, which can cause seizures and other adverse effects. The dosages mentioned in the paragraph, 4 mg/g and 1 mg/g, indicate the amount of MSG administered to the mice per gram of body weight."},

Seizure susceptibility\n\nThe entities \"Neonatal injections of MSG (4 mg/g and 1 mg/g)\" do not directly refer to a disease, but rather to a method of inducing seizures in mice for the purpose of research. Therefore, they are not relevant to the task of identifying diseases.\n\nI hope this revised answer meets your requirements."},
