Calcium antagonist (CD-832) - This is a chemical compound that blocks the action of calcium ions in the body.\n2.

Myocardial ischemia - This refers to a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, which can lead to tissue damage or death.\n4. Partial coronary stenosis - This is a narrowing of one or more of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* CD-832\n* Isoproterenol\n* Myocardial ischemia\n* Partial coronary stenosis"},
