Let's break down the paragraph and identify the \"Chemical\" entities:\n\n1. \"Female sex\" - Not a chemical entity, so we can exclude it.\n2. \"hepatocellular damage\" - This is a term that refers to damage to liver cells, but it's not a specific chemical entity.\n3. \"plasma bilirubin value\" - Bilirubin is a chemical compound, so this is a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Bilirubin"},
