Hypertension (high blood pressure)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Adrenaline is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that plays a crucial role in the body's \"fight or flight\" response. It is a chemical messenger that stimulates the heart, increases blood pressure, and increases the body's metabolic rate.\n* Hypertension is a condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. It is a chemical imbalance in the body that can lead to various health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are adrenaline and hypertension."},
