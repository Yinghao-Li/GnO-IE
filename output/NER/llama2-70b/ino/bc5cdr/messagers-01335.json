The study found that visual field defects appeared before any corresponding changes in other tested clinical parameters. Therefore, the paragraph mentions two disease entities:\n\n1. Visual field defects - This is the primary disease entity being studied in the paragraph. The authors are investigating the appearance of visual field defects and their relationship to other clinical parameters.\n2. Changes in clinical parameters - This is a secondary disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. The authors are comparing the appearance of visual field defects to changes in other clinical parameters to determine if there is a correlation between the two."},
