Urine: Although urine is primarily composed of water, it also contains various chemicals, including waste products, ions, and other substances.\n2. Sediment: Sediment refers to the solid particles present in urine, which can include various chemical compounds such as crystals, cells, and other substances.\n3. Microscopy: Microscopy is a technique used to study small objects, and in this context, it is used to examine the sediment in urine. The chemical entities in this step are the dyes or stains used to enhance the visibility of the sediment.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Urine\n2. Sediment\n3. Dyes or stains (used in microscopy)"},
