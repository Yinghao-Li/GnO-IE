Diabetes is a disease characterized by high blood sugar levels, and it is mentioned in the paragraph as a condition that the rats have.\n2. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. It is mentioned in the paragraph as a possible effect of streptozotocin.\n3. ISO resistance is a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to isoproterenol (ISO), a medication used to stimulate the heart. It is mentioned in the paragraph as a possible effect of diabetes.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are diabetes, insulin resistance, and ISO resistance."},
