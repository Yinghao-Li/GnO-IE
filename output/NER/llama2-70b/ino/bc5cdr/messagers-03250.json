Succinylcholine is a chemical compound used as a muscle relaxant in anesthesia. It is a depolarizing muscle relaxant that works by blocking the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle paralysis.\n2. Myalgia is a medical term used to describe muscle pain or soreness. It is a symptom that can occur after surgery, and is often caused by the use of certain anesthetic agents, such as succinylcholine.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are succinylcholine, which is a drug used to induce muscle paralysis, and myalgia, which is a symptom that can occur as a side effect of the drug."},
