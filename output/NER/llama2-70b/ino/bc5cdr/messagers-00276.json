EAD (Early Afterdepolarization)\n3. TdP (Torsades de Pointes)\n\nThese entities are chemical because they are related to the electrical activity of the heart and the ionic movements that occur during the cardiac action potential. TDR refers to the spread of repolarization across the heart tissue, EAD is a premature depolarization of the cardiac muscle cells, and TdP is a specific type of arrhythmia that can occur as a result of abnormal ionic activity. All of these entities are related to the chemical and electrical processes that occur within the heart and are therefore considered chemical entities."},
