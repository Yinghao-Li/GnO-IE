QT prolongation - QT prolongation is a condition where the electrical activity of the heart's ventricles is prolonged, leading to an increased risk of developing torsades de pointes (TdP), a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. QT prolongation can be caused by a variety of factors, including certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, and heart failure.\n2. TdP - Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a type of ventricular fibrillation that can occur when the heart's electrical activity becomes disorganized. It is characterized by a rapid, irregular heartbeat and can lead to syncope, seizures, and even sudden death. TdP is often associated with QT prolongation.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. QT prolongation\n2. TdP"},
