Axonal involvement\n3. Clinical manifestation\n4. Electrodiagnostic findings\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. LACNP is a type of motor neuron disease that affects the cortical muscles and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness. It is considered a rare disease.\n2. Axonal involvement refers to the damage or degeneration of the axons, which are the long, slender extensions of nerve cells that transmit signals.\n3. Clinical manifestation refers to the visible or observable symptoms of a disease or condition, such as muscle weakness, muscle wasting, or muscle twitching.\n4. Electrodiagnostic findings refer to the results of tests that measure the electrical activity of muscles and nerves, such as electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction studies (NCS). These tests can help diagnose muscle and nerve disorders, including LACNP."},

Electrodiagnostic - Electrodiagnostic refers to the use of electrical tests and measurements to diagnose and evaluate neurological disorders.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are LACNP, axonal, and electrodiagnostic."},
