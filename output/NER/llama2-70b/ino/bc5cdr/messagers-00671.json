Optic neuropathy is a disease or condition that affects the optic nerve, leading to vision loss or blindness. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the condition that all patients had after starting ethambutol therapy.\n2. Ethambutol therapy is a treatment for tuberculosis, but it can cause optic neuropathy as a side effect.
