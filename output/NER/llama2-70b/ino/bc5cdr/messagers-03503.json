Gentamicin-induced acute renal failure is a specific type of acute renal failure that is caused by the administration of the antibiotic gentamicin.

Acute renal failure is a disease entity that refers to the sudden and temporary loss of kidney function. It is a clear reference to a disease.\n\nThe other entity mentioned in the paragraph, \"gentamicin-induced acute renal failure,\" is a specific type of acute renal failure that is caused by the administration of the antibiotic gentamicin. Since it is a specific type of acute renal failure, it is not a separate disease entity, but rather a subset of acute renal failure. Therefore, it is not included in the list of disease entities."},
