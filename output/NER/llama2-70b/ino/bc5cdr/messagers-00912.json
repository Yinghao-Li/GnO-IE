Stereotypy and catalepsy are associated with neurological disorders, while WDS behavior is a symptom of certain movement disorders. Penile erections can be a symptom of various physical or psychological conditions.\n\nIt's worth noting that the paragraph is describing the effects of different doses of trazodone on these behaviors, rather than the diseases themselves."},
