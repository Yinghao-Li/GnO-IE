Identify the specific disease or condition mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Maleate-induced renal injury\n3. Identify any other related or associated conditions mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Increase in renal vascular resistance\n * Increase in urinary excretion of total protein, glucose, sodium, NGAL, and NAG\n * Upregulation of KIM-1\n * Decrease in renal blood flow\n * Decrease in claudin-2 expression\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
