Identify the main entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Liver transplantation (LT)\n * Acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (ALF)\n * Non-acetaminophen-induced ALF\n * Chronic liver disease (CLD)\n2. Determine which of these entities are diseases:\n * Acetaminophen-induced ALF: Yes, this is a disease caused by excessive consumption of acetaminophen.\n * Non-acetaminophen-induced ALF: Yes, this is a disease caused by other factors.\n * Chronic liver disease (CLD): Yes, this is a disease characterized by the gradual and irreversible damage to the liver.\n3. Identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph:\n * Acetaminophen-induced ALF\n * Non-acetaminophen-induced ALF\n * Chronic liver disease (CLD)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
