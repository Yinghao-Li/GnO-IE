Heparin\n\nHeparin is a chemical entity, specifically a glycosaminoglycan, which is a type of polysaccharide. It is a naturally occurring compound found in the cells of the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels) and is used as an anticoagulant drug to prevent blood clots.\n\n2. Anticoagulant drugs\n\nThe paragraph mentions that several new anticoagulant drugs are in development. Anticoagulant drugs are chemical entities that prevent the formation of blood clots or inhibit the activity of clotting factors. They can be classified into different classes based on their mechanism of action, such as vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin), direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran), and factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban).\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are heparin and anticoagulant drugs (a class of drugs that includes various chemical entities with different mechanisms of action)."},
