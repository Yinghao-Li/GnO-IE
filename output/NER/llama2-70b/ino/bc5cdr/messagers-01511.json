Parvalbumin-staining change: Parvalbumin is a protein that is present in the brain and is used as a marker for neuronal damage. A change in parvalbumin staining in the central SNR (substantia nigra pars reticulata) indicates that there has been some damage to the neurons in that area.\n2. Nissl-staining visualized neuronal distortion: Nissl staining is a method used to stain neurons in the brain. The fact that Nissl-staining visualized some neuronal distortion suggests that there has been some alteration in the normal structure of the neurons in the area being studied. This could be indicative of a disease or condition that affects the brain."},

Parvalbumin is a protein that is used as a marker for neuronal damage. It is a chemical substance that is used to detect changes in the brain tissue.\n2. Nissl is a staining technique that is used to visualize neurons in the brain. It involves the use of a chemical dye to stain the neurons, allowing them to be seen under a microscope.\n\nTherefore, both parvalbumin and Nissl are chemical entities in the paragraph."},
