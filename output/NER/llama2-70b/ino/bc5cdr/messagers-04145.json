It is not a disease, but rather a diagnostic tool.\n* Side effects are the negative effects that a patient experiences as a result of a medication or medical procedure. In this paragraph, the side effects of hysterosalpingography with four different media (Dimer-X, Hexabrix, Vasurix polyvidone, and Endografine) are being evaluated.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Hysterosalpingography and Side effects."},
