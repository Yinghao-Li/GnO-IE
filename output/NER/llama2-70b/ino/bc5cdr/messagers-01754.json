Isoprenaline is a drug that can cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, and can be used to test the heart's response to stress.\n2. Propranolol is a drug that can slow down the heart rate and decrease blood pressure, and is used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure, angina, and anxiety.\n3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart, and can be used to diagnose heart rhythm disorders and other heart conditions.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the drugs isoprenaline and propranolol, and the medical test electrocardiogram."},
