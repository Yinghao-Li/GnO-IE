Short P - P intervals are abnormally short intervals between heartbeats, which can be a sign of certain cardiac arrhythmias or abnormal heart rhythms.\n3. The basic sinus cycle refers to the normal, regular rhythm of the heart, which is generated by the sinus node.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the abnormal heart rhythms and the normal heart rhythm."},
