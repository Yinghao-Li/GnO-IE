Elevated reactive oxygen (ROS) / nitrogen species (RNS) - These are not diseases, but rather molecular entities that are believed to play a role in the development of cardiotoxicity.\n2. Adriamycin (ADR) - This is a drug that is known to cause cardiotoxicity, and is therefore a disease-related entity.\n3. Cardiotoxicity - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the damage caused to the heart muscle by the drug.\n4. Cardiomyocyte oxidative / nitrative damage - This is a disease entity, as it refers to the damage caused to the heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cardiotoxicity\n* Cardiomyocyte oxidative / nitrative damage"},
