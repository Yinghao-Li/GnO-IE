Subependymal cysts are a type of brain abnormality that can occur in infants. They are considered a disease entity because they are an abnormality in the brain that can have negative effects on the child's health and development.\n2. Cocaine prenatal exposure is a disease entity because it is a harmful exposure that can have negative effects on the developing fetus. It is associated with an increased risk of various health problems, including subependymal cysts.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are subependymal cysts and cocaine prenatal exposure."},
