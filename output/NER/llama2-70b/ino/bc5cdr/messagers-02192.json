It is a folic acid inhibitor and is commonly used to treat bacterial infections.\n\n2. Hemolytic anemia\n\nHemolytic anemia is a condition where the red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced, leading to anemia. In this paragraph, it is mentioned as a side effect of trimethoprim.\n\n3. Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction\n\nAcute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) is a severe and potentially life-threatening complication that can occur after blood transfusion. It is caused by an immune response to antigens on the donor red blood cells, leading to the destruction of the recipient's red blood cells. In this paragraph, it is mentioned as a presentation of trimethoprim-induced immune hemolytic anemia.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Trimethoprim\n2. Hemolytic anemia\n3. Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction"},
