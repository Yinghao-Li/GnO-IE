Leukopenia: This is a condition where there is a decrease in the number of white blood cells. Therefore, \"leukopenia\" is a \"Disease\" entity.\n2. Thrombocytopenia: This is a condition where there is a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood. Therefore, \"thrombocytopenia\" is a \"Disease\" entity.\n3. Vomitus: Vomiting is a symptom of many diseases, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, \"vomitus\" is not a \"Disease\" entity.\n4. Diarrhea: This is a symptom of many diseases, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, \"diarrhea\" is not a \"Disease\" entity.\n5. Stomatitis: This is a condition where there is inflammation of the mouth and lips. Therefore, \"stomatitis\" is a \"Disease\" entity.\n6. Hand-foot syndrome: This is a condition where there is redness, swelling, and pain on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Therefore, \"hand-foot syndrome\" is a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Leukopenia\n* Thrombocytopenia\n* Stomatitis\n* Hand-foot syndrome"},
