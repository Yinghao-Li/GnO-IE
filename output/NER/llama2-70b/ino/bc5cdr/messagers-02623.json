Epileptiform discharges are a type of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can be a symptom of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy.\n2. Triphasic waves are a specific type of epileptiform discharge that are characterized by three distinct phases: a positive wave, a negative wave, and a return to baseline.\n3. Diffuse generalized slowing refers to a decrease in the frequency of brain waves throughout the brain, which can be a sign of various neurological conditions, including seizures, encephalopathy, and brain injury."},
