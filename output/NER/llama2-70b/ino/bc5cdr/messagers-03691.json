Drug: A drug is a chemical substance that is designed to interact with biological systems and alter their function.

Toxicity: Toxicity is a measure of the degree to which a substance can harm or even kill living organisms. In this paragraph, the term \"toxicity\" refers to the harmful effects of a drug on the body.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the drug itself and the toxicity that it can cause."},
