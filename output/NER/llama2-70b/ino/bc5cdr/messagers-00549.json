These changes can be considered a disease or disorder, as they are an abnormality in the normal functioning of the bladder epithelium. Therefore, both \"Indomethacin - induced morphologic changes\" and \"urinary bladder epithelium\" can be classified as \"Disease\" entities."},

The changes in the epithelium induced by indomethacin are the disease entity in this context."},
