Isoniazid is a chemical compound that is used as an antibiotic and antituberculosis agent.\n2. [35S] TBPS (35S-labeled tuberculin purified protein derivative) is a radioactive derivative of tuberculin, which is a protein extracted from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, used in the diagnosis of tuberculosis.\n3. Beta-carboline is a chemical compound that has been shown to have various biological activities, including anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects.\n\nTherefore, the three chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Isoniazid\n2. [35S] TBPS\n3. Beta-carboline"},
