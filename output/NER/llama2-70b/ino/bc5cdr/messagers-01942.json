Cocaine use disorder\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus is a condition where there is a reduction in blood flow to the globus pallidus, a part of the brain, resulting in damage or dysfunction.\n* Alcohol use disorder and cocaine use disorder are both substance use disorders, which are chronic conditions characterized by excessive and compulsive use of alcohol or cocaine, despite negative consequences.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus\n2. Alcohol use disorder\n3. Cocaine use disorder"},

Alcohol use disorder\n\nThe entity \"cocaine use disorder\" has been removed as it is not directly related to the disease described in the paragraph. The paragraph only mentions cocaine use as a contributing factor to the development of bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus, but it does not explicitly mention cocaine use disorder as a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus\n2. Alcohol use disorder"},
