Identify the main subject of the sentence:\n\nThe main subject of the sentence is \"Sixty-seven men\"\n2. Identify the condition or health status of the main subject:\n\nThe condition of the men is \"metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer\"\n3. Identify any additional health conditions or complications mentioned in the sentence:\n\nThe sentence mentions \"neurologic examinations\" and \"nerve conduction studies (NCS)\" which are diagnostic tests performed to assess the men's neurological health.\n4. Identify any treatments or interventions mentioned in the sentence:\n\nThe sentence mentions \"oral thalidomide\" which is a treatment for the men's prostate cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
