Myocardial stress\n2. Isoproterenol-induced myocardial stress\n\nMyocardial stress refers to the stress or damage caused to the heart muscle, which can lead to various cardiovascular problems. Isoproterenol-induced myocardial stress is a specific type of myocardial stress that is caused by the administration of isoproterenol, a drug that can stimulate the heart and increase its workload, leading to stress and damage to the heart muscle.\n\nI hope this helps!

Myocardial stress\n\nThe entity \"Isoproterenol-induced myocardial stress\" can be removed since it is a specific type of myocardial stress, and \"myocardial stress\" itself is already included in the list.\n\nTherefore, the final list of \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Myocardial stress"},
