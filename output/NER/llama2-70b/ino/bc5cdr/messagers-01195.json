Methadone is a chemical substance, a medication used in the treatment of opioid addiction.\n2. QTc is a measure of the time interval between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in an electrocardiogram (ECG). It is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. QTc is a quantitative measure that can be used to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Methadone and QTc."},
