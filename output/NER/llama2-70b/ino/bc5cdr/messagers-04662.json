Negative mucosal potential (NMP)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Central pain is a type of pain that originates in the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord. It is a disease entity because it is a medical condition that can cause discomfort and disability.\n* Negative mucosal potential (NMP) is a type of signal that is recorded from the mucous membranes of the body, such as those lining the digestive tract. It is a disease entity because it can be an indicator of certain medical conditions, such as inflammation or injury to the mucous membranes.\n\nNote that while chemo-somatosensory evoked potential (CSSEP) is also mentioned in the paragraph, it is not a disease entity but rather a diagnostic test used to assess the function of the somatosensory system."},
