Baseline\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Acute renal insufficiency (ARI) is a disease or condition that affects the kidneys and impairs their ability to filter waste products from the blood.\n2. High-dose melphalan is a chemotherapy drug that can cause damage to the kidneys and lead to ARI.\n3. Serum creatinine level is a measure of the amount of creatinine in the blood, which is a waste product that is normally removed by the kidneys. An increase in serum creatinine level can indicate kidney damage or dysfunction.\n4. Baseline is a reference point or starting point for measuring changes in the serum creatinine level. In this context, it refers to the level of serum creatinine before the patient received high-dose melphalan."},
