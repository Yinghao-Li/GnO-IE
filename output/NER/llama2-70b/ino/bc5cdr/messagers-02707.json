Memory deficit is a disease or condition where an individual experiences difficulty in remembering information.\n2. Morris water maze test is a behavioral test used to evaluate spatial learning and memory in rodents. It is not a disease entity.\n3. STZ ( Streptozotocin ) administration is a method of inducing diabetes in animals, and it is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Memory deficit and STZ ( Streptozotocin ) administration."},
