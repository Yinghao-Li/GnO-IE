Proteinuria\n6. Chronic renal failure\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Losartan is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat high blood pressure and kidney disease.\n2. Glomerulosclerosis is a condition where the glomeruli ( tiny blood vessels in the kidneys) become scarred and hardened, leading to kidney damage.\n3. Tubular atrophy is the shrinkage and loss of tubules in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure.\n4. Interstitial fibrosis is the scarring of the kidney's interstitial tissue, which can lead to kidney failure.\n5. Proteinuria is the presence of protein in the urine, which can be a sign of kidney damage.\n6. Chronic renal failure is the gradual loss of kidney function over time, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the body.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
