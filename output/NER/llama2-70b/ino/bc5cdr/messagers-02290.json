Identify the keywords related to disease:\n\nIn this paragraph, the keywords related to disease are:\n\n* Circumflex artery\n* CxAD (which stands for coronary artery disease)\n* Nitroglycerin (a medication used to treat angina, a symptom of coronary artery disease)\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\nThe entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cromakalim\n* Pinacidil\n* Nitroglycerin\n3. Determine which entities are related to disease:\n\nOut of the three entities mentioned, two are related to disease:\n\n* CxAD (coronary artery disease)\n* Nitroglycerin (used to treat angina, a symptom of coronary artery disease)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* CxAD (coronary artery disease)\n* Angina (mentioned as a symptom of coronary artery disease)"},
