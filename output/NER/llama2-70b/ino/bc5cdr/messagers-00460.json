Side effects are undesirable symptoms or conditions that occur as a result of a medical treatment or intervention. They can be considered a disease or a disorder in their own right, as they can cause harm and discomfort to the patient.\n2. Protease inhibitor is a type of medication used to treat certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, by blocking the activity of proteases, which are enzymes that play a crucial role in the replication of the virus. In this context, protease inhibitor is not a disease entity itself, but it is mentioned as a potential treatment for diseases caused by protease enzymes.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the side effects and the protease inhibitor, as they are both related to the treatment and management of diseases."},

Side effects are undesirable symptoms or conditions that occur as a result of a medical treatment or intervention. They can be considered a disease or a disorder in their own right, as they can cause harm and discomfort to the patient. In the context of the paragraph, side effects are mentioned as a restriction on the use of a potent protease inhibitor in children, indicating that the side effects are a negative consequence of the treatment.\n\nTherefore, the only entity that clearly refers to a disease or disorder in the paragraph is \"side effects\"."},
