    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Glial\n2. Neuronal\n3. Markers\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Glial: Glial cells are a type of cell that provide support and protection to neurons in the central nervous system. They are non-neuronal cells that play a crucial role in maintaining the health and function of neurons.\n2. Neuronal: Neurons are cells that transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. They are the main functional units of the nervous system.\n3. Markers: Markers are chemical substances that are used to detect and identify specific molecules or cells. In this context, markers are used to detect and indicate the presence of glial and neuronal cells in the area of the lesion."},
