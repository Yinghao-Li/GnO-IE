Delayed development of bladder pathology\n\nThe paragraph describes the development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice, which can be considered a disease. The phrase \"delayed development\" suggests that the onset of the disease was not immediate, but rather occurred over time. Therefore, both \"bladder pathology\" and \"delayed development of bladder pathology\" can be classified as disease entities."},
