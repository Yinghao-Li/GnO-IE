Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, a chemical messenger in the brain that helps regulate various physiological and psychological processes, including mood, appetite, and sleep.\n2. Serotonin antagonist is a type of drug that blocks the action of serotonin at synapses, which can have an impact on various physiological and psychological processes. In this context, the use of a serotonin antagonist may have contributed to the development of severe acute major depression disorder."},
