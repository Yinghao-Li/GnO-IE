Epilepsy - The paragraph mentions convulsions, which is a symptom of epilepsy.\n2. Pilocarpine - Pilocarpine is a drug that can cause convulsions and is often used in animal models of epilepsy to induce seizures.\n3. GABA - GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is involved in regulating the activity of neurons in the brain. It has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including epilepsy.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Epilepsy\n* Pilocarpine-induced convulsions\n* GABA-related disorders (although GABA itself is not a disease, it is related to various neurological disorders)"},
