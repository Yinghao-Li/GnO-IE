Therefore, it is a clear reference to a disease.\n\nOn the other hand, \"cardiovascular death\" is a broader term that encompasses various diseases and conditions related to the cardiovascular system, including heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases. While it is related to disease, it is not a specific disease entity, and therefore, it is not included in the revised list."},
