Specific gravity is a measure of the density of a substance, which is a chemical property.\n2. 15 / HTN and 90 / HTN are not chemical entities. They are probably abbreviations for certain medical conditions, but they do not represent any specific chemical substances.\n3. Control is not a chemical entity.
