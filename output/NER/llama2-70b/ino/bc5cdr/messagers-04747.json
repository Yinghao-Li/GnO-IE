It is a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is deficient in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. L-DOPA is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps to replace the missing dopamine and alleviate symptoms of the disease.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* L-DOPA"},
