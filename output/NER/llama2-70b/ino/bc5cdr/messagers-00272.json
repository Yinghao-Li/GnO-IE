Myocardial infarction (MI) - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a heart attack or damage to the heart muscle caused by a blockage of blood flow.\n2. Isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction - This is a disease entity, as it refers to a specific type of heart attack caused by the administration of the drug isoproterenol.\n3. Lipid metabolism - This is not a disease entity, as it refers to the process by which the body metabolizes lipids, which are a type of fat. While abnormalities in lipid metabolism can contribute to the development of certain diseases, the term itself does not refer to a specific disease.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myocardial infarction\n2. Isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction"},

Isoproterenol: Isoproterenol is a chemical compound that is used to induce myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rats.\n4. Lipid metabolism: Lipid metabolism refers to the various chemical reactions that occur in the body to metabolize lipids (fats).\n5.
