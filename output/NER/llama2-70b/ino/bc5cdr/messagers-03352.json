Neutropenia\n\nExplanation:\n\nNeutropenia is a medical condition where the number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood is lower than normal. Neutrophils play a crucial role in fighting infections, and a low neutrophil count can increase the risk of infections. In the paragraph, neutropenia is mentioned as a factor that can adversely affect the cure rate of infections in cancer patients. Therefore, neutropenia is a chemical entity in the paragraph."},

Neutrophils\n\nExplanation:\nNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in fighting infections. They are produced in the bone marrow and are an important part of the immune system. In the paragraph, neutrophils are mentioned as a factor that can affect the cure rate of infections in cancer patients. Therefore, neutrophils are a chemical entity in the paragraph."},
