TNF-a (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)\n4. ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species)\n5. Nitrite levels\n\nThese entities are all related to various diseases and conditions, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph as being diseases themselves. GFAP and CD11b are proteins that are involved in the immune response and are often studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. TNF-a is a cytokine that is involved in inflammation and is associated with various diseases, including arthritis and cancer. ROS are highly reactive molecules that can damage cellular components and are associated with oxidative stress, which can contribute to various diseases. Nitrite levels are often studied in the context of cardiovascular disease."},
