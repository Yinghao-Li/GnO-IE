Hearing loss is a disease entity because it is a condition that affects the normal functioning of the auditory system, leading to impaired hearing.\n2. Kanamycin-induced hearing loss is also a disease entity because it is a specific type of hearing loss that is caused by the use of the antibiotic kanamycin."},
