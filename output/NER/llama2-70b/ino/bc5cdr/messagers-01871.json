Bipolar mania - This is a mental health disorder characterized by periods of mania or hypomania, often alternating with episodes of depression.\n2. Na ( + ) / K ( + ) - ATPase inhibitor - This is a type of drug that inhibits the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase enzyme, which is involved in regulating the concentration of sodium and potassium ions in the body.\n3. Ouabain - This is a specific Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor that has been studied for its effects on the brain and behavior.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Bipolar mania\n* Na ( + ) / K ( + ) - ATPase inhibitor\n* Ouabain"},
