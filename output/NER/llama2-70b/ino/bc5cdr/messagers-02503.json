Propofol\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Delirium is a medical condition characterized by a sudden change in mental status, causing confusion, disorientation, and altered levels of consciousness. It is a serious disturbance in consciousness, attention, and perception that can be caused by various factors, such as medication, infection, surgery, or other medical conditions.\n* Thiopentone and propofol are both medications used for inducing and maintaining anesthesia. They are not diseases, but their use can increase the risk of developing delirium in some individuals.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Delirium\n\nThe other two entities, thiopentone and propofol, are medications that can increase the risk of developing delirium, but they are not diseases themselves."},
