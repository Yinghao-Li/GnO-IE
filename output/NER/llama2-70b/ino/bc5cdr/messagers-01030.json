Aspirin is a chemical compound, specifically a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), that is used to prevent blood clots and relieve pain.\n2. Vascular nephropathy is a disease that affects the kidneys and is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the kidneys. It is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, but rather a disease that can be caused by various factors, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain medications. However, in the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned as an underlying disease that increases the risk of ESRD associated with aspirin use."},
