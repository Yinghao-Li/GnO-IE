VT (sustained ventricular tachycardia)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Nifekalant hydrochloride is a chemical compound that is used as a drug to treat various heart rhythm disorders. It is a chemical entity because it is a substance composed of atoms or molecules that have a specific chemical structure and properties.\n* VT, or sustained ventricular tachycardia, is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that is characterized by a rapid heart rate and irregular heartbeat. While VT is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, it is often referred to as a \"chemical\" entity in medical contexts because it is a physiological response that can be influenced by chemical factors, such as drugs or electrolyte imbalances. In this paragraph, VT is being referred to as a chemical entity because it is being affected by the administration of nifekalant hydrochloride."},
