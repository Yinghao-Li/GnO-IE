Direct thrombin inhibitors\n\nThrombin is a chemical entity because it is a protein that plays a crucial role in blood clotting. Heparin is also a chemical entity because it is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan that is commonly used as an anticoagulant. Direct thrombin inhibitors are chemical entities because they are synthetic or biological molecules that bind directly to thrombin and prevent its activity.\n\nSo, the three chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Thrombin\n2. Heparin\n3. Direct thrombin inhibitors"},
