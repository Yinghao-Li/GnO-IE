Ser (SO3H)7-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE: This is a specific compound that contains the amino acid serine (Ser) with a sulfate group (SO3H) attached to it, followed by an acetyl (Ac) group, and then the peptide CCK-2-8 with a sulfate group (SE) at the end.\n3. Thr (SO3H)7-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE: This is a specific compound that contains the amino acid threonine (Thr) with a sulfate group (SO3H) attached to it, followed by an acetyl (Ac) group, and then the peptide CCK-2-8 with a sulfate group (SE) at the end.\n4. Hyp (SO3H)-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE: This is a specific compound that contains the amino acid hypersine (Hyp) with a sulfate group (SO3H) attached to it, followed by an acetyl (Ac) group, and then the peptide CCK-2-8 with a sulfate group (SE) at the end.\n5.
