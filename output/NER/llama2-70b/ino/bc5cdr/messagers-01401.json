Precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is characterized by the overproduction of immature white blood cells called precursor B cells.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the drugs used in induction chemotherapy and the cancer cells themselves (precursor B cells)."},
