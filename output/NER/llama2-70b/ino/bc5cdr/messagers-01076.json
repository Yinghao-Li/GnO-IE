Hormone Replacement Therapy (HT) - HT is a medical treatment that involves taking hormones to replace those that the body is not producing or producing at lower levels. In this case, it refers to combined estrogen and progesterone therapy.\n2. Estrogen - Estrogen is a hormone that is produced by the ovaries and plays a crucial role in female reproductive and sexual health. In the context of HT, estrogen is used to replace the natural estrogen that the body is not producing or producing at lower levels.\n3. Progesterone - Progesterone is a hormone that is produced by the ovaries and plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and embryogenesis. In the context of HT, progesterone is used to complement estrogen therapy and reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hormone Replacement Therapy (HT)\n* Estrogen\n* Progesterone"},
