Neuronal cell death\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Memory impairment is a cognitive disorder that affects the ability to remember, learn, and retrieve information. It is a symptom of various neurological and psychiatric conditions, and in this paragraph, it is mentioned as a result of STZ-induced glial activation and post-synaptic neurotoxicity.\n* Neuronal cell death, also known as neurodegeneration, is a condition where neurons in the brain die prematurely, leading to various neurological disorders. In this paragraph, it is mentioned as a result of STZ-induced glial activation and post-synaptic neurotoxicity.\n\nTherefore, both memory impairment and neuronal cell death can be classified as \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},
