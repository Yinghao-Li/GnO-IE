Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* NDI is a disease characterized by the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, leading to excessive thirst and urination. It is the primary disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n* Polyuria is a symptom of NDI and other diseases, and it refers to the excessive production of urine. While it is related to disease, it is not a disease entity in itself, and therefore, it is not included in the revised list."},
