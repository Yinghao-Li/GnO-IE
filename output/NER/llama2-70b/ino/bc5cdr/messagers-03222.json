Diabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the kidneys and can lead to kidney failure. It is a disease entity.\n2. Inflammation is a natural response of the body's immune system to injury or infection. While inflammation is a normal process, chronic inflammation can lead to various diseases, such as arthritis, atherosclerosis, and cancer.
