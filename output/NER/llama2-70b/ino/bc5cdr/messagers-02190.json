Mitochondrial abnormalities refer to problems with the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures within cells. Cardiac dysfunction refers to problems with the heart's ability to function properly, and diastolic dysfunction specifically refers to problems with the heart's ability to relax and fill with blood properly."},
