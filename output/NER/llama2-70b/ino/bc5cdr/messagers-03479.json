Beta-agonists\n\nIpratropium bromide is a chemical compound that is used as a bronchodilator to treat respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Beta-agonists, on the other hand, are a class of drugs that work by stimulating beta-adrenergic receptors in the body, which can help to relax airway muscles and improve breathing.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Ipratropium bromide\n* Beta-agonists (as a class, not a specific compound)"},
