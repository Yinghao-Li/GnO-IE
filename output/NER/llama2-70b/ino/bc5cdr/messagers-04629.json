    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hyperprolactinemia\n2. Median eminence (ME)\n3. Dopamine (DA) concentrations\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Hyperprolactinemia is a condition where there is an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood. It is a hormonal disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and infertility.\n2. Median eminence is a part of the brain that plays a role in regulating the release of hormones from the pituitary gland.\n3. Dopamine (DA) concentrations refer to the levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. While dopamine is not a disease, abnormal levels of dopamine have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, addiction, and schizophrenia.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are hyperprolactinemia, median eminence, and dopamine concentrations."},
