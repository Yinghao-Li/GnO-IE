The term \"end-stage\" suggests that the disease has progressed to a advanced stage, and \"renal\" refers to the kidneys, which are organs that play a crucial role in removing waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to identify any other chemical entities in the paragraph!"},
