Castration is a surgical procedure that removes the testes, which are the primary source of testosterone in the body. It is a disease state in which the testes are absent or non-functional, leading to low levels of testosterone.\n2. STZ (Streptozotocin) is a chemical that is used to induce diabetes in animal models. STZ-treated rats are considered a disease model for studying diabetes and its complications.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Castration and STZ-treated rats."},
