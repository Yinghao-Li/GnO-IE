Atypical plasma cholinesterase: This is a condition where the level of plasma cholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, is abnormal.\n2. Homozygocity: This refers to a genetic condition where an individual has two copies of a particular gene, one from each parent, which can result in the expression of a particular trait or disease. In this case, the individual has two copies of the gene for atypical plasma cholinesterase, resulting in homozygocity."},
