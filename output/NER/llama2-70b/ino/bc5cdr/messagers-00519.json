Doxorubicin: Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. It is not a disease entity itself, but it is used to treat diseases.\n2. Cardiac mitochondria: Mitochondria are organelles found in cells that generate energy for the cell through cellular respiration. Cardiac mitochondria are specifically found in heart cells and play a crucial role in maintaining the heart's function.\n3. NADH-dehydrogenase: NADH-dehydrogenase is an enzyme that helps generate energy for the cell through cellular respiration. It is an important enzyme in the electron transport chain, which takes place in the mitochondria.\n4. Mitochondrial calcium-loading capacity: Mitochondrial calcium-loading capacity refers to the ability of mitochondria to take in calcium ions, which is essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondria.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Doxorubicin (a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer)\n2. Cardiac mitochondria (organelles found in heart cells that generate energy for the cell)\n3. NADH-dehydrogenase (an enzyme that helps generate energy for the cell through cellular respiration)\n4. Mitochondrial calcium-loading capacity (the ability of mitochondria to take in calcium ions, which is essential for their proper functioning)"},
