Creatine phosphokinase levels\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Liver function tests are a group of tests that are performed to assess the functioning of the liver. They are typically used to diagnose and monitor liver diseases, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.\n* Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels are a measure of the level of an enzyme in the blood that is released when muscle tissue is damaged. Elevated CPK levels can be indicative of muscle damage or disease, such as muscular dystrophy or muscle inflammation.\n\nTherefore, both liver function tests and CPK levels are considered \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},
