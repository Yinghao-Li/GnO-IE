PGE2 synthesis is a disease entity because it is a process that is being studied and measured in the context of a medical treatment (aspirin).\n2. jj rats and jJ rats are disease entities because they are animal models used to study a medical condition. In this case, they are being used to study the effect of aspirin on PGE2 synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the three disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. PGE2 synthesis\n2. jj rats\n3. jJ rats"},
