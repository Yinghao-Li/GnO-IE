Fever: Fever is a sign of an elevated body temperature, which can be caused by various chemical reactions in the body, such as the release of pyrogens, cytokines, or other inflammatory mediators.\n2. Chill: A chill is a feeling of coldness or shivering, which can be caused by the release of certain chemicals in the body, such as histamine, that cause vasodilation and increased blood flow to the skin.\n3. Vomiting: Vomiting is the act of expelling stomach contents through the mouth, which can be caused by various chemical changes in the body, such as increased levels of serotonin or dopamine, or by the presence of toxins or irritants in the gut.\n4. Jaundice: Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, which can be caused by an excess of bilirubin, a yellow pigment, in the blood. Bilirubin is a chemical produced during the breakdown of red blood cells in the liver.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Pyrogens\n2. Cytokines\n3. Histamine\n4. Serotonin\n5. Dopamine\n6. Bilirubin"},
