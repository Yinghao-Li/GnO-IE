Cysteine protease inhibition\n\nThese three entities can be classified as diseases or disorders because they are all related to cellular dysfunction or damage. Necrosis is a form of cell death that occurs due to injury, infection, or other forms of cellular stress. Thiol depletion refers to a decrease in the levels of thiol molecules, which are important antioxidants that protect cells from oxidative damage. Cysteine protease inhibition refers to the inhibition of enzymes that break down proteins, which can lead to various cellular problems.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Necrosis\n* Thiol depletion\n* Cysteine protease inhibition"},
