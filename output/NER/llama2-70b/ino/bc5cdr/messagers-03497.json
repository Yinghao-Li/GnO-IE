Adrenaline: Also known as epinephrine, it is a hormone and a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the body's \"fight or flight\" response to stress. It is not a disease entity.\n2. Noradrenaline: Also known as norepinephrine, it is a hormone and a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating the body's response to stress and other physiological responses. It is not a disease entity.\n3. Dextrose solution: Dextrose is a type of sugar that is commonly used as a sweetener in foods and drinks. In the context of the paragraph, it is being used as a control substance in the study. It is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the paragraph. The paragraph describes a study that involves healthy volunteers and does not mention any diseases or medical conditions."},
