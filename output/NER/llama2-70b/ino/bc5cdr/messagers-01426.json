Lead\n\nSuccimer is a chemical compound used for chelation therapy, which is a medical treatment that uses chemicals to remove heavy metals or other substances from the body. Lead, on the other hand, is a toxic metal that can be harmful to human health, particularly in children, and can cause cognitive impairment and other health problems.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Succimer (a chemical compound)\n* Lead (a toxic metal)"},
