Therefore, both \"acute kidney injury\" and \"cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury\" can be classified as \"Disease\" entities."},

Acute kidney injury\n\nThe mention of \"cisplatin-induced\" modifies the entity \"acute kidney injury\" and indicates that it is a specific type of acute kidney injury that is caused by cisplatin. Therefore, \"acute kidney injury\" is the most relevant entity that refers to Disease in the given paragraph."},

Kinin B2 receptor\n\nCisplatin is a chemical compound that is used as a chemotherapy drug to treat various types of cancer. It is a platinum-based drug that works by damaging DNA and disrupting cell division, leading to cell death in cancer cells.\n\nKinin B2 receptor is a protein that is found on the surface of certain cells and plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure and inflammation. It is a G-protein coupled receptor that binds to kinins, which are a family of peptide hormones that cause blood vessels to dilate.\n\nIn the paragraph, the author is studying the role of the kinin B2 receptor in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. They are using kinin B2 receptor knockout mice, which are mice that have had the gene for the kinin B2 receptor removed, to investigate the role of this receptor in cisplatin's toxic effects on the kidneys."},
