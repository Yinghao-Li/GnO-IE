Nocistatin: This is a drug that is being administered to mice in the study. It is not a disease entity.\n2. Scopolamine: This is a drug that is known to impair cognitive function, including memory and learning. It is a disease entity.\n3. Spontaneous alternation: This is a behavioral phenomenon in which mice alternate between two different paths or actions. It is not a disease entity.\n4. Passive avoidance task: This is a behavioral task used to study learning and memory in mice. It is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Scopolamine-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance behaviors.\n\nThis phrase describes the negative effect of scopolamine on the mice's ability to perform the spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance tasks, which can be considered a disease-like condition."},
