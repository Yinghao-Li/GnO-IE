Left ventricular dysfunction is a disease entity as it refers to a impairment in the functioning of the left ventricle of the heart.\n2. Cardiac output is a physiological measure of the heart's ability to pump blood, and decline in cardiac output can be an indication of disease.\n3. E / A ratio is a measure of the heart's diastolic function, and an abnormal E / A ratio can be indicative of disease.\n4. LV dysfunction is a disease entity as it refers to a impairment in the functioning of the left ventricle of the heart.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Left ventricular dysfunction, Cardiac output, E / A ratio, and LV dysfunction."},

LV dysfunction is a disease entity as it refers to a impairment in the functioning of the left ventricle of the heart.\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as cardiac output and E / A ratio, are not directly related to disease, but rather are measures of cardiac function that can be used to assess disease severity.
