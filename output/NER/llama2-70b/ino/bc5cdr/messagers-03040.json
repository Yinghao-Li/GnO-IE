QT prolongation\n\nQT prolongation is a condition where the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is longer than normal. It can be a sign of various heart conditions, such as arrhythmias or structural heart disease. In the context of the paragraph, QT prolongation is mentioned as a potential side effect of drugs, and the assessment of drug potential for QT prolongation is the focus of the paragraph. Therefore, QT prolongation can be classified as a disease entity in this context."},

QT prolongation\n\nQT prolongation is a cardiac arrhythmia condition that can lead to irregular heartbeats and is considered a potential side effect of certain drugs. In the context of the paragraph, QT prolongation is the disease entity being discussed."},

QT prolongation\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are cells that are derived from adult cells, such as skin or blood cells, and are reprogrammed to have the ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body, similar to embryonic stem cells.\n2. Cardiomyocytes are cells that make up the muscle tissue of the heart.\n3. Drugs refer to chemical substances that are designed to interact with biological systems and have a therapeutic effect.\n4. QT prolongation refers to an increase in the time interval between the Q and T waves in the electrocardiogram (ECG), which can be a sign of abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
