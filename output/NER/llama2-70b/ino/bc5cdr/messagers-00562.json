Cancer\n\nThalidomide is a drug that is used to treat certain diseases, including cancer. The paragraph mentions that thalidomide blocks the activity of angiogenic agents, which are proteins that promote the growth of new blood vessels. The growth of new blood vessels is a process that is necessary for the growth and spread of cancer, so thalidomide can help to prevent the growth and spread of cancer by blocking the activity of these proteins. Therefore, cancer is a disease that is relevant to the paragraph and can be considered a \"Disease\" entity."},
