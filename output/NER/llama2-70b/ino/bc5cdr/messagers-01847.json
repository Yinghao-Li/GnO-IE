Rhabdomyolysis\n\nThe term \"ischemic stroke\" refers to a type of stroke that occurs due to a blockage in a blood vessel, which can cause damage to the brain. While it is a serious medical condition, it is not a disease in the classical sense, but rather a symptom or a condition caused by various underlying factors. Therefore, it is not considered a \"Disease\" entity in this context."},

Methadone and heroin are both chemical substances, and they are mentioned as separate entities in the paragraph.\n2. Rhabdomyolysis is a medical condition that involves the breakdown of muscle tissue, which can release myoglobin and other intracellular contents into the bloodstream. While rhabdomyolysis is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, it is a condition that can be caused by chemical substances, such as methadone and heroin, and is therefore included in this list.\n3. Ischemic stroke is a medical condition that occurs when blood flow to the brain is reduced or blocked, resulting in tissue damage or death. Like rhabdomyolysis, ischemic stroke is not a chemical entity, but it is a condition that can be caused by chemical substances, such as methadone and heroin, and is therefore included in this list.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are methadone, heroin, rhabdomyolysis, and ischemic stroke."},
