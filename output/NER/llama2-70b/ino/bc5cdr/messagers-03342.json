Epilepsy - The paragraph mentions \"seizure models\" and \"anticonvulsant effects,\" which suggest that the research is related to epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures.\n2. Lithium - Lithium is a medication commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, which is a mental illness.\n3. Pilocarpine - Pilocarpine is a medication that can cause seizures and is used in animal models of epilepsy to induce seizures.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Epilepsy\n* Bipolar disorder\n\nI hope this helps!
