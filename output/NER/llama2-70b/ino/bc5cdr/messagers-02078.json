Histological alterations\n\nThese are all indicators or markers of disease, rather than the disease itself. TNFalpha and MDA are both markers of inflammation, while caspase-3 activity is a marker of apoptosis (programmed cell death). Histological alterations refer to changes in the structure of tissues, which can be indicative of disease.\n\nThe disease being referred to in the paragraph is not explicitly stated, but based on the mention of BCNU administration and the mention of tumor necrosis factor - alpha, it is likely that the disease being studied is cancer."},

MDA (malondialdehyde) - a compound formed as a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, which is a marker of oxidative stress\n5.
