Teratogenic refers to the ability of a substance to cause developmental abnormalities in a fetus, which is a disease or condition that affects the development of an embryo or fetus.\n2. Pregnant rats are not a disease entity in themselves, but they are mentioned in the context of the study as the test subjects for the administration of the compounds. The mention of pregnant rats suggests that the study is related to reproductive health and the potential risks of the compounds on fetal development."},
