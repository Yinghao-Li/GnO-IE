Chronic hyperprolactinemia is a medical condition characterized by an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood for an extended period. It is a type of endocrine disorder.\n2. Changes in dopamine neurons refer to alterations in the neurons that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including mood regulation, motivation, and reward processing. These changes could be indicative of a neurological disorder or disease."},
