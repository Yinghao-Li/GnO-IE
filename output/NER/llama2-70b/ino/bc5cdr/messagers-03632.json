FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. PS is a chemical compound that activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which is a nuclear receptor that plays a role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism.\n2. AMNS is a chemical compound known as Adriamycin, which is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer.\n3. FSGS is a disease entity, specifically a type of kidney disease characterized by scarring of some of the glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are PS and AMNS, as they are both chemical compounds. FSGS is not a chemical entity, but rather a disease entity that is mentioned as a consequence of the administration of PS and AMNS."},
