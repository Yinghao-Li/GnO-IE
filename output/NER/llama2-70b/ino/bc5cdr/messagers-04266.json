Eosinophilic myocarditis is a condition where the heart muscle becomes inflamed due to the presence of eosinophils, which are a type of white blood cell. In this case, it is induced by carbamazepine.\n3. Hemosiderosis is a condition where there is an accumulation of iron in the body, which can cause damage to organs such as the heart.\n4. Cardiogenic shock is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, leading to symptoms such as low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and shortness of breath."},
