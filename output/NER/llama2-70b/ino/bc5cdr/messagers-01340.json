Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that is given before the primary treatment (usually surgery) to shrink the tumor and reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.\n2. Epirubicin and paclitaxel (Taxol) are both chemotherapy drugs used to treat various types of cancer, including breast cancer.\n3. Cyclophosphamide is also a chemotherapy drug used to treat cancer.\n\nTherefore, all four entities mentioned in the paragraph are related to cancer treatment and can be classified as \"Disease\" entities."},
