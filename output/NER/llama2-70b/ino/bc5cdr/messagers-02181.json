Botox\n\nBotox is a chemical entity that is a popular cosmetic treatment used to temporarily relax facial muscles and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. It is also used medically to treat various muscle-related conditions, such as blepharospasm (eyelid spasms), strabismus (crossed eyes), and cervical dystonia (abnormal neck movements). Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin, which is a neurotoxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum.\n\n2. Botulinum toxin\n\nBotulinum toxin is a chemical entity that is produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. It is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is involved in muscle contraction. By blocking the release of acetylcholine, botulinum toxin can cause muscle paralysis.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Botox and botulinum toxin."},
