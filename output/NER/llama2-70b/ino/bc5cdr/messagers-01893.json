    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Flecainide plasma concentration\n2. Reference range\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Flecainide plasma concentration is a measure of the level of the drug flecainide in the blood, and it is used to diagnose and monitor various cardiac arrhythmias.\n2. Reference range is a range of values that is considered normal or typical for a particular laboratory test or measurement. In this case, the reference range for flecainide plasma concentration is 200-1000 microg/L.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the flecainide plasma concentration and the reference range for flecainide plasma concentration."},
