The entity \"creatinine\" is a chemical waste product that can be used to diagnose and monitor certain medical conditions, but it is not a disease itself. The entity \"age\" is not a disease, but rather a demographic characteristic that can be a risk factor for certain diseases.\n\nTherefore, the two entities that clearly refer to diseases in the paragraph are:\n\n1.

Creatinine is a chemical compound that is produced by the body and is used as a marker for kidney function. It is measured in micromoles per liter (μmol/L) or milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).\n2. Blood pressure is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of the paragraph as a physiological parameter that is related to the risk of ACE inhibitor intolerance.
