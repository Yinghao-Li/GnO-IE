    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Aminoglycosides\n\nThese are a class of antibiotics that are composed of amino sugars and are known to have potential nephrotoxic effects. Examples of aminoglycosides include gentamicin, streptomycin, and tobramycin.\n\n2. Gentamicin\n\nGentamicin is a specific aminoglycoside antibiotic that is often used to treat bacterial infections. It is composed of a mixture of gentamicin C1 and gentamicin C2, which are both aminoglycosides.\n\n3. Streptomycin\n\nStreptomycin is another aminoglycoside antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is composed of a mixture of streptomycin A and streptomycin B, which are both aminoglycosides.\n\n4. Tobramycin\n\nTobramycin is a third aminoglycoside antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is composed of a mixture of tobramycin A and tobramycin B, which are both aminoglycosides.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* Aminoglycosides (a class of antibiotics)\n* Gentamicin (a specific aminoglycoside antibiotic)\n* Streptomycin (a specific aminoglycoside antibiotic)\n* Tobramycin (a specific aminoglycoside antibiotic)"},

The term \"aminoglycosides\" is a class of antibiotics that includes these three compounds, but it is not a specific chemical entity and can be removed from the list."},
