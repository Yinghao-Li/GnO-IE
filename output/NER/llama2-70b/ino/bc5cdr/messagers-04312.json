Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n* Animal behavior\n* Seizures\n* Death\n* Cortical EEG tracings\n2. Determine which of these entities are related to disease:\n\n* Seizures and death can be symptoms or consequences of various diseases.\n* Cortical EEG tracings can be used to diagnose and monitor certain neurological disorders.\n3. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Seizures\n* Death\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the entities that are directly related to disease, which are seizures and death."},

Seizures: Seizures are a chemical change in the brain that can be caused by various factors, including changes in neurotransmitter levels, ion imbalances, or other chemical disturbances.\n2. Death: Death can be caused by various chemical changes in the body, such as changes in blood chemistry, electrolyte imbalances, or toxicity due to chemical substances.\n3. Cortical EEG tracings: EEG tracings are a measure of the electrical activity of the brain, which is influenced by chemical changes in the brain, such as changes in neurotransmitter levels or ion concentrations.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Seizures\n* Death\n* Cortical EEG tracings"},
