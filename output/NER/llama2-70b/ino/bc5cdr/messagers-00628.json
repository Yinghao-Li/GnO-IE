Apoptosis\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Acute liver failure is a disease condition where the liver suddenly stops functioning properly and fails to perform its normal functions.\n* Apoptosis is a programmed form of cell death, which can occur due to various reasons, including signaling errors or damage to cells. In the context of the paragraph, apoptosis is mentioned as a possible factor in the development of acute liver failure.\n\nTherefore, both acute liver failure and apoptosis can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},

Acute liver failure\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Acute liver failure is a disease condition where the liver suddenly stops functioning properly and fails to perform its normal functions. It is clearly mentioned in the paragraph as a disease entity.\n\nApoptosis, on the other hand, is a natural process of programmed cell death, and while it can contribute to the development of diseases, it is not a disease entity in and of itself. Therefore, it has been removed from the list of \"Disease\" entities in this context."},
