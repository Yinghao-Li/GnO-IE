YMDD motif mutants\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"YMDD motif mutants\" as the target of detection using PCR-RFLP. The term \"motif\" refers to a specific sequence or pattern of nucleotides in DNA or protein, and a \"mutant\" is a variant of that sequence that has undergone a change, often associated with a disease or disorder. Therefore, \"YMDD motif mutants\" can be inferred to be a disease or disorder entity."},
