Mutation: A change in the DNA sequence of an organism that can result in a change in the function or structure of a protein, which can lead to a disease or disorder.\n2. Catalytic triad: A group of three amino acids in an enzyme that work together to form the active site and perform the enzymatic reaction. Disruption of the catalytic triad can result in a loss of enzymatic activity, leading to a disease or disorder.\n3. Silent phenotype: A phenotype that does not display any visible or measurable effects, but may still have an impact on the organism's health or function. In this context, the silent phenotype refers to the fact that the mutation does not result in an obvious change in the protein's structure or function, but still disrupts its activity."},
