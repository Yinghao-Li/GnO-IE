Antithrombotic drugs\n\nThese are chemical substances that prevent the formation of blood clots or thrombi, and are used to treat conditions such as stroke, heart attack, and pulmonary embolism. Examples of antithrombotic drugs include aspirin, warfarin, and clopidogrel.\n\n2. Cerebral microbleeds\n\nCerebral microbleeds are small bleeds that occur in the brain, often as a result of abnormalities in the blood vessels. These bleeds can be caused by various factors, including trauma, stroke, and underlying medical conditions.\n\n3. Intracerebral hemorrhage\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage is a type of stroke that occurs when there is bleeding within the brain tissue itself. This can be caused by various factors, including high blood pressure, aneurysms, and blood vessel malformations.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Antithrombotic drugs\n* Cerebral microbleeds\n* Intracerebral hemorrhage"},
