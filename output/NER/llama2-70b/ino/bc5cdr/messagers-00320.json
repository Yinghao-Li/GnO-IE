Older age: This is a risk factor for many diseases, and it is mentioned as a possible contributing factor in the paragraph.\n2. Cumulative dose: This refers to the total amount of a medication or substance that a person has taken over time. Cumulative dose can be a contributing factor to the development of certain diseases, such as side effects or toxicity."},

Cumulative dose\n\nThe mention of \"older age\" is not directly related to a specific disease, so it's not included in the list of disease entities. \"Cumulative dose\" is a contributing factor to the development of certain diseases, making it a relevant entity in this context."},

The paragraph mentions the following entities:\n\n* Older age\n* Cumulative dose\n\nNeither of these entities can be considered chemical entities. \"Older age\" is a temporal concept, and \"cumulative dose\" is a measure of the total amount of a substance that has been administered or exposure to a substance over time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nNo chemical entities were found in the given paragraph."},
