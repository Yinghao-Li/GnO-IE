    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Hyperalgesia\n2. Allodynia\n3. Clinical pain disorders\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Hyperalgesia refers to an increased sensitivity to pain, which is a symptom of various pain disorders.\n2. Allodynia refers to pain resulting from a normally non-painful stimulus, which is also a symptom of various pain disorders.\n3. Clinical pain disorders refer to actual pain conditions that affect patients, such as chronic pain, acute pain, neuropathic pain, etc.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the pain disorders that are being studied using intradermal injections of glutamate and capsaicin in human experimental pain models."},

Hyperalgesia and allodynia are both symptoms of pain disorders and are therefore relevant to the context of disease.\n2. Clinical pain disorders are not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, so it's not clear which specific diseases are being referred to. Therefore, it's better to focus on the symptoms that are being studied in the context of pain research."},
