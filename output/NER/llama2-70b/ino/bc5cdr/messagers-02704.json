Morphine-induced memory impairment: This is a disease state or condition that is caused by the use of morphine, a drug that can impair memory.\n2. Hippocampal LTP: This is a disease state or condition that refers to the long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, a part of the brain that plays a key role in memory formation. The attenuation of this process by CCK-8 suggests that it may be involved in the development of memory impairment.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Morphine-induced memory impairment\n* Hippocampal LTP"},
