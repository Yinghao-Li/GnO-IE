Hyperkalemia\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Hyperkalemia is a condition where there is an abnormally high level of potassium in the blood, which can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and heart arrhythmias. In severe cases, it can lead to cardiac arrest.\n\nTherefore, the only \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is Hyperkalemia."},
