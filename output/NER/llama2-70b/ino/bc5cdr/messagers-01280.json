Renal damage is a disease that affects the kidneys and can be caused by various factors, including exposure to certain chemicals like chloroacetaldehyde.\n2. Anti-tumor therapy refers to the treatment of cancer, which can sometimes result in adverse effects such as renal damage.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"renal damage\" and \"anti-tumor therapy\"."},
