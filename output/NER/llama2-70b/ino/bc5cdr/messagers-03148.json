Paresthesias\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Paresthesias refer to abnormal sensations, such as numbness, tingling, or burning, that occur without any obvious cause. It is a symptom of a disease or condition that affects the nervous system.\n\nThe entity \"visual loss\" is not a disease entity, as it is a symptom of a disease or condition that affects the eye or the brain, but it is not a disease itself.\n\nI hope this revised answer meets your requirements.
