Pallidotomy is a surgical procedure that involves the destruction of a small area in the brain called the pallidum. This procedure is typically performed to treat certain movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and essential tremor.\n2. Gamma knife is a non-invasive surgical procedure that uses highly focused beams of radiation to treat various conditions, including brain tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and trigeminal neuralgia.\n\nIn the paragraph, \"pallidotomy with the gamma knife\" refers to a specific medical procedure that combines both entities, and the phrase \"a positive experience\" suggests that the outcome of the procedure was beneficial for the patient."},
