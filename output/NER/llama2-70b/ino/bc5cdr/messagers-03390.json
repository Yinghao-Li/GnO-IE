However, the text does mention two types of receptors, AT1aR and AT2R, which are involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph can be inferred as:\n\n1. Hypertension (high blood pressure) - The RAAS is activated in response to low blood pressure, and an imbalance in the expression of AT1aR and AT2R has been linked to hypertension.\n2. Kidney disease - The paragraph specifically mentions the expression of AT1aR and AT2R in adult offspring, which suggests that the study being discussed may have implications for kidney development or disease.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are Hypertension and Kidney disease."},

Angiotensin II (AT2R) is a chemical entity because it is a protein that is produced in the body and has a specific function.\n2. PCE (perchlorate) is a chemical entity because it is a chemical compound that is used in the study described in the paragraph."},
