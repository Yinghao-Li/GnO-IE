End-stage renal disease\n5. SHR (Spontaneously hypertensive rats)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Losartan is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat high blood pressure and kidney disease.\n2. ADR (Angiotensin II receptor) is a protein that is involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which regulates blood pressure and electrolyte balance.\n3. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a condition where some of the glomeruli in the kidneys become scarred, leading to kidney damage.\n4. End-stage renal disease is the final stage of chronic kidney disease, where the kidneys are no longer able to function properly and require dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n5. SHR (Spontaneously hypertensive rats) are a breed of rats that are genetically predisposed to develop high blood pressure, and are often used in scientific research to study hypertension and related diseases."},
