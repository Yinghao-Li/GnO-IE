Identify the keywords: The keywords in the paragraph are \"pathological Ca (2 + ) signaling,\" \"aconitine poisoning,\" \"in vitro,\" and \"in vivo.\"\n2. Identify the entities:\n\na. Pathological Ca (2 + ) signaling - This is a biological process that occurs in cells and is related to the regulation of calcium ions. It is not a disease entity.\n\nb. Aconitine poisoning - Aconitine is a toxic alkaloid that can cause poisoning in humans and animals. This is a disease entity.\n\nc. In vitro - This means \"in the glass\" and refers to experiments or studies conducted in a laboratory setting using cells or tissues in a controlled environment. It is not a disease entity.\n\nd. In vivo - This means \"in the living\" and refers to experiments or studies conducted on living organisms. It is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Aconitine poisoning"},
