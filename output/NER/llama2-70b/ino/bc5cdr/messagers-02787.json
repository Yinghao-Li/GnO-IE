Therefore, elevated levels of cTnT can be an indicator of cardiotoxicity.\n3. \"cardiotoxicity\" - Cardiotoxicity is the disease entity in this sentence, as it refers to the damage to the heart muscle caused by chemotherapy.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cardiotoxicity"},
