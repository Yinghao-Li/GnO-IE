Diabetes: The paragraph mentions \"streptozotocin diabetic rats,\" which indicates that the rats have been induced with diabetes using streptozotocin. Diabetes is a disease characterized by high blood sugar levels, and it is often associated with complications such as cardiovascular disease.\n2. Cardiotoxic effect: The paragraph mentions that isoproterenol has a cardiotoxic effect, which means that it can damage the heart. This is a disease-related entity because it describes a harmful effect on the body.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are diabetes and cardiotoxic effect."},
