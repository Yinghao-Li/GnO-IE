It is not a \"Disease\" entity in this context.\n4. \"flunarizine\" - This term refers to a drug that is used to treat certain neurological disorders, including epilepsy and migraines. It is not a \"Disease\" entity in this context.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Tonic convulsions\n2. Audiogenic tonic convulsions"},
