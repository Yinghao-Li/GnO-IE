Lorazepam is a chemical compound and a drug that is used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and other conditions. It is a benzodiazepine, which is a class of drugs that work by enhancing the effect of a neurotransmitter in the brain called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\n2. VLBW is an abbreviation for very-low-birth-weight, which refers to infants who are born with a birth weight of less than 1,500 grams (3.3 pounds). VLBW is not a chemical entity, but rather a term used to describe a specific medical condition.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is lorazepam."},
