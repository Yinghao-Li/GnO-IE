PDTC\n3. 0.15 M NaCl solution\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this paragraph, the authors are describing a research study in which female Wistar rats were injected with different substances to investigate their effects. Gentamicin and PDTC are both drugs that are known to have therapeutic effects, but they can also have adverse effects or toxicities, especially when used in high doses or for extended periods. Therefore, they can be considered as \"Disease\" entities in this context, as they have the potential to cause harm to the rats.\n\nThe 0.15 M NaCl solution is a control substance that is used as a comparison to the gentamicin and gentamicin + PDTC treatments. It is not a disease entity in this context, as it is not expected to have any significant therapeutic or adverse effects on the rats."},
