Epilepsy\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Epileptogenesis refers to the process by which a person develops epilepsy. It is a disease process that involves changes in the brain that lead to the development of seizures.\n2. Cognitive deficits refer to impairments in cognitive function, such as memory, attention, or learning difficulties, that can be caused by various diseases or disorders, including epilepsy.\n3. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. It is a disease that affects the brain and can cause a variety of symptoms, including seizures, cognitive impairments, and other neurological deficits."},
