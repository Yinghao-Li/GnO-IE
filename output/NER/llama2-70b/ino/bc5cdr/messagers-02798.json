Group NP, Group F, Group M, and Group FM are not diseases, but rather groups or categories of patients in a study. They are not diseases themselves, but rather a way to classify patients for the purpose of the study.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Myoclonus\n\nI hope this helps!
