Dobutamine induced ischaemia is a specific type of ischaemia that is caused by the administration of the drug dobutamine, which can cause a decrease in blood flow to certain areas of the body.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are ischaemia and dobutamine induced ischaemia."},
