Doxorubicin is a chemical drug used in cancer treatment.\n2. Liposomes are artificially prepared vesicles made up of lipids that can be used to encapsulate drugs and deliver them to specific targets in the body.\n3. Stomatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the mouth and lips, which can be a side effect of certain drugs, including doxorubicin.\n4. Hand-foot syndrome, also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, is a condition characterized by painful redness and swelling of the hands and feet, which can also be a side effect of certain drugs, including doxorubicin.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the drug doxorubicin, the liposomes used to deliver the drug, and the two side effects, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome, that can occur as a result of using the drug."},
