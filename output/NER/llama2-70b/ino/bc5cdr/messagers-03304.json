Serum cardiac marker enzyme: This is a chemical substance that is produced by the heart and released into the bloodstream, and its levels can be used to diagnose and monitor cardiac diseases.\n2. Histopathological variables: Histopathology is the study of the microscopic structure of tissues, and histopathological variables refer to the chemical and physical changes that occur in tissues as a result of disease or injury.\n3. Protein levels: Proteins are large, complex molecules that are composed of amino acids and play a crucial role in nearly all cellular processes. Protein levels refer to the concentration of specific proteins in a biological sample, which can be used to diagnose and monitor various diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
