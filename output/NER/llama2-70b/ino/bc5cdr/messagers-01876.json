Here are the entities in the paragraph that correspond to the \"Disease\" category:\n\n* hyperlocomotion\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Hyperlocomotion is a condition where rats exhibit excessive movement or locomotor activity, which is not a normal behavior in healthy rats. In this paragraph, the authors are suggesting that ouabain at certain concentrations can induce this condition in rats. Therefore, hyperlocomotion can be considered a disease or abnormal condition in this context."},

Here's the revised list of entities that correspond to the \"Disease\" category in the given paragraph:\n\n* None\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The paragraph only mentions hyperlocomotion, which is not a disease or a medical condition. It's a behavioral response to a stimulus (ouabain) and doesn't fit the category of \"Disease\" in this context. Therefore, there are no entities that clearly refer to a disease in this paragraph."},
