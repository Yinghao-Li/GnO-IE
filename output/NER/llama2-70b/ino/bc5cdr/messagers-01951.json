Enhancement is a disease entity because it is an abnormality in the brain that can be indicative of various neurological conditions, such as a tumor, infection, or inflammation.\n2. Pontine refers to the pons, a part of the brainstem. The use of the term \"typical signs\" suggests that the enhancement in this region is a common feature of a particular disease or condition.\n3. Posterior regions refer to the back part of the brain. The mention of enhancement in this region, along with the pontine region, suggests that the disease or condition affects a specific area of the brain."},

Contrast agent: The paragraph mentions \"enhancement,\" which suggests the use of a contrast agent to improve the visibility of certain structures in the brain. The contrast agent is a chemical substance that is injected into the body and accumulates in the brain, allowing for better imaging of the brain's internal structures.\n2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents: These are chemicals that are specifically designed to be used in MRI scans. They are injected into the body and interact with the magnetic fields and radio waves used in MRI scans, allowing for better imaging of the brain's internal structures.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
