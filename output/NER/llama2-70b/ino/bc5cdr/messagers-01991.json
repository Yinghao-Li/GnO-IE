Seroconversion - The process of converting from a negative to a positive blood test result for HIV antibodies, indicating infection with the virus.\n3. Hazard ratio (HR) - A measure of the risk of developing a disease or condition over time, comparing the risk in a group of individuals with a specific characteristic (e.g., daily smokers of crack cocaine) to a reference group.\n4. Confounders - Factors that can affect the relationship between a risk factor and a disease, which need to be controlled for in order to accurately assess the relationship between the risk factor and the disease.\n5. Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 - Time periods during which the risk of HIV seroconversion was evaluated.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* HIV\n* Seroconversion\n* Hazard ratio (HR)\n* Confounders\n* Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (as they relate to the risk of HIV seroconversion)"},
