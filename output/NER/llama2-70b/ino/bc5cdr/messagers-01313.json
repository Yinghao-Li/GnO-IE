Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors. It is considered a disease or disorder because it affects the normal development and functioning of the brain and can significantly impact an individual's quality of life.\n2. Aggression, behavioral dyscontrol, and inattention are all symptoms or behaviors that can be associated with autism. Aggression refers to hostile or violent behavior towards oneself or others, behavioral dyscontrol refers to difficulty regulating one's behavior, and inattention refers to difficulty paying attention or focusing. These symptoms can interfere with daily functioning and are often targeted for treatment in individuals with autism.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are autism, aggression, behavioral dyscontrol, and inattention."},
