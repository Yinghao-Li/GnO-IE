Aconitine: Aconitine is a toxic alkaloid that can cause various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, and cancer.\n2. Ca (2+): Calcium ion (Ca2+) is essential for various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and cell signaling. However, an overload of Ca2+ can cause cell damage and lead to various diseases, such as cardiac arrhythmias, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer.\n3. Ca (2+)-handling proteins: These proteins play a crucial role in regulating Ca2+ levels in cells and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of these proteins can lead to various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, and cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Aconitine\n2. Ca (2+)-overload\n3. Cardiovascular disease\n4. Neurological disorders\n5. Cancer"},
