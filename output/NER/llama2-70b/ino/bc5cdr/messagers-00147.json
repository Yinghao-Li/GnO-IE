    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. Ureteral lithiasis - Lithiasis refers to the presence of stones or calculi in the urinary tract. The stones are made up of chemical substances such as calcium oxalate, uric acid, or cystine.\n2. Nephrostomy tube - A nephrostomy tube is a medical device used to drain urine from the kidney when the normal flow of urine is blocked, such as in cases of kidney stones or other obstructions. The tube is made of a chemical material, such as silicone or polyurethane.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Calcium oxalate\n* Uric acid\n* Cystine\n* Silicone\n* Polyurethane"},
