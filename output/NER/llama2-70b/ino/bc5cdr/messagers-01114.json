Liver function tests are medical tests that assess the liver's ability to perform its various functions, such as producing bile, detoxifying harmful substances, and storing energy. Abnormal liver function test results can indicate liver disease or damage.\n2. Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) is an enzyme found in the liver that is involved in the transfer of an amino group from one molecule to another. Elevated levels of GGT in the blood can indicate liver damage or disease, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. In the paragraph, the result of the GGT test is mentioned as being greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit, indicating a potential liver problem."},

Therefore, the only entity that clearly refers to a disease in the paragraph is \"Gamma glutamyl transferase\" (GGT), which is a specific enzyme that can be elevated in certain liver diseases."},
