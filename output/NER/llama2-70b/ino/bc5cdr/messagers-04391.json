Desmethylfluoxetine\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Acute hyperkinetic delirium is a disease or medical condition characterized by a sudden onset of confusion, agitation, and changes in mental status.\n2. High serum total fluoxetine concentration refers to an abnormally high level of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, desmethylfluoxetine, in the bloodstream, which can be indicative of a toxic or adverse reaction to the medication.\n3. Fluoxetine is a medication used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other conditions.\n4. Desmethylfluoxetine is an active metabolite of fluoxetine, which means it is a substance produced by the body as it processes the medication. In this context, it is mentioned as a contributing factor to the high serum total fluoxetine concentration."},
