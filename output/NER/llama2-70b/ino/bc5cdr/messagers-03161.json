Chemical compounds\n\nThe seed decoction contains unspecified chemical compounds that are extracted from the seeds. These compounds could include a variety of organic molecules, such as alkaloids, glycosides, phenolic compounds, terpenes, or other types of natural products.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
