Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is discussing the effects of different isomers of propranolol on cardiac arrhythmias in cats.\n2. Identify the condition being studied: The condition being studied is cardiac arrhythmias.\n3. Identify the species being studied: The species being studied is cats.\n4. Identify any mention of a disease or disorder: The paragraph does not mention any specific disease or disorder, but it does mention cardiac arrhythmias, which can be a symptom of various cardiovascular diseases.\n5. Identify any mention of a treatment or intervention: The paragraph mentions the use of propranolol isomers to prevent adrenaline-induced cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cardiac arrhythmias\n2. Cardiovascular diseases (mentioned indirectly)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the conditions that are being studied or treated, which include cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular diseases."},
