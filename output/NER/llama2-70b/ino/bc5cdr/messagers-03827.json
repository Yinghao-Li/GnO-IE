It is a soft, silvery-white alkaline earth metal that is not found in its elemental form in nature. Barium is often used in a wide range of applications, including the production of electronic devices, fireworks, and as a contrast agent in medical imaging. In the paragraph, barium is mentioned as the substance that is ingested and has adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system.\n\nTherefore, barium is a chemical entity in the paragraph."},
