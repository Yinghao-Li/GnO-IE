Identify the keywords related to disease:\n\nIn this paragraph, the keywords related to disease are \"seizures\" and \"CSF\" (cerebrospinal fluid).\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the sentence:\n\nThe entities mentioned in the sentence are:\n\n* Fetal serum\n* Maternal brain\n* CSF\n3. Determine which entities are diseases:\n\nOut of the three entities mentioned, \"seizures\" is a disease, while \"fetal serum\" and \"maternal brain\" are not diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Seizures"},
