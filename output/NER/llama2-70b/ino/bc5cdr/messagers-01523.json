BCNU - exposed\n\nThe term \"BCNU\" is an acronym for a chemical compound that is known to be toxic and carcinogenic, and the phrase \"BCNU - exposed\" clearly implies that the rats in this group were exposed to this harmful substance. Therefore, this entity can be considered a disease or negative health effect."},

BCNU (1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in animals, including humans. It is a chemical entity that is produced naturally in the body.\n* BCNU, on the other hand, is a synthetic chemical compound that is used as a chemotherapy drug. It is also known as carmustine.\n\nSo, the two chemical entities in the paragraph are melatonin and BCNU."},
