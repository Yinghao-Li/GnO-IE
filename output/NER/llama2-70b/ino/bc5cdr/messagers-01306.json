Interfering behaviors\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors. It is considered a disease or disorder because it affects the normal functioning of the brain and can significantly impact an individual's quality of life.\n* Interfering behaviors are not a disease or disorder in themselves, but they can be a symptom or complication of autism. In this context, interfering behaviors are likely referring to behaviors that are problematic or disruptive, such as aggression, self-injury, or other forms of disruptive behavior that may be associated with autism.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are autism and interfering behaviors."},
