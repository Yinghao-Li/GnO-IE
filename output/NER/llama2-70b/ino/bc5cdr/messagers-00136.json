Identify the context: The paragraph is describing a comparison of the toxicity of two substances, NS-718 and Fungizone, in vitro and in vivo.\n2. Identify the entities mentioned:\n* NS-718\n* Fungizone\n* amphotericin B\n* sodium deoxycholate\n* renal cell cultures\n* kidney\n* rats\n3. Determine which entities are diseases:\n* None of the entities mentioned are diseases.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},
