Central venous catheters: These are tubes made of silicone or polyurethane that are inserted into a vein in the neck, chest, or groin to monitor blood pressure, draw blood samples, or administer medication. They are made of synthetic materials and do not contain any chemicals.\n2. Arterial catheters: These are tubes made of silicone or polyurethane that are inserted into an artery in the arm or leg to monitor blood pressure or draw blood samples. Like central venous catheters, they are made of synthetic materials and do not contain any chemicals.\n3. Routine noninvasive monitoring: This refers to the measurement of various physiological parameters, such as blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature, using devices that do not penetrate the skin or enter the body. Examples include blood pressure cuffs, pulse oximeters, and thermometers. These devices do not contain any chemicals.\n\nTherefore, there are no \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph."},
