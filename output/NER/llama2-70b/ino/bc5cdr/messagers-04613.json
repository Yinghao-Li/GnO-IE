    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. QT interval\n2. QTc interval\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. QT interval: The QT interval is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. It is a physiological parameter that is affected by the activity of the heart and is often used in electrocardiography (ECG) to assess the heart's electrical activity.\n2. QTc interval: The QTc interval is a corrected version of the QT interval that takes into account the heart rate. It is calculated by dividing the QT interval by the square root of the RR interval (the time between two consecutive heartbeats). The QTc interval is also a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, but it is adjusted for the heart rate, making it a more accurate measure of the heart's electrical activity.\n\nNeither of these entities is a chemical substance, but they are both physiological parameters that are related to the electrical activity of the heart and are often used in medical diagnosis and treatment."},
