Cyclophosphamide is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, and its metabolites can cause damage to cells and tissues, leading to various side effects and toxicities. Therefore, the entity \"cyclophosphamide metabolites\" can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n\nHere's the list of disease entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. Cyclophosphamide metabolites"},
