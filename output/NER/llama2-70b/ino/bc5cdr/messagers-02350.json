Danazol\n\nDanazol is a synthetic steroid hormone that is used to treat endometriosis, fibrocystic breast disease, and hereditary angioedema. It is a chemical entity because it is a synthetic compound that has a specific chemical structure and properties.\n\n2. Adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions are undesirable effects that occur as a result of exposure to a chemical entity, in this case, danazol. Adverse reactions are not chemical entities themselves, but they are related to the chemical entity (danazol) being discussed.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are danazol and adverse reactions."},
