Myocardial metabolic demand\n\nThe paragraph discusses the effects of various drugs on the dilation of coronary arteries, which suggests that the coronary arteries are diseased or disordered in some way. Additionally, the mention of myocardial metabolic demand implies that there is an increased demand for oxygen and nutrients in the heart muscle, which can be a sign of disease or disorder.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Coronary arteries\n* Myocardial metabolic demand"},
