Pentylenetetrazole: This is a drug that is known to induce convulsions in animals, so it is not a disease.\n2. Bemegride: This is another drug that is known to induce convulsions in animals, so it is not a disease.\n3. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA): This is a receptor that plays a role in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory, and it is not a disease.\n4. Picrotoxin: This is a toxin that can cause convulsions and seizures, so it is not a disease.\n5. Electroshock: This is a method of inducing convulsions or seizures using electrical current, so it is not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Clonic convulsions\n* Convulsions\n* Seizures\n\nThese are all terms that refer to medical conditions or disorders that can affect the nervous system."},
