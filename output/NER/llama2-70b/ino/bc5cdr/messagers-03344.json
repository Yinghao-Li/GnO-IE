Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, and it is mentioned in the paragraph as the condition that the research is focused on.\n2. Lithium-pilocarpine model and pilocarpine model are both animal models used to study epilepsy. They are considered \"disease\" entities because they are used to simulate the symptoms of epilepsy in animals for research purposes.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are epilepsy, lithium-pilocarpine model, and pilocarpine model."},
