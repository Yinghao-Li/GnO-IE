Azotemia: Azotemia is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of nitrogen-containing compounds, such as urea, in the blood.\n2. Body fluid insufficiency: This refers to a decrease in the amount of body fluids, such as blood plasma, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\n3. Bacterial infections: Bacterial infections are caused by the presence of bacteria, which are microorganisms that can cause disease.\n\nSo, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Urea\n* Electrolytes\n* Bacteria"},
