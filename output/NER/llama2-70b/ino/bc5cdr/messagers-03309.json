Myocardial ischemia - Myocardial ischemia is a disease characterized by a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to a lack of oxygen and nutrients.\n2. Acute myocardial ischemia - Acute myocardial ischemia is a sudden and severe reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, which can lead to heart muscle damage or even death.\n3. Apoptotic pathways - Apoptosis is a programmed form of cell death, which can occur due to various factors such as injury, disease, or abnormal cell growth. Apoptotic pathways refer to the biochemical pathways that regulate the process of programmed cell death.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Myocardial ischemia\n2. Acute myocardial ischemia\n3. Apoptosis (programmed cell death)"},
