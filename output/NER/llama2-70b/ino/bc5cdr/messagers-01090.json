Hepatocellular pattern of damage: This refers to a type of liver damage that affects the liver cells (hepatocytes) and is a common finding in liver disease.\n2. Inverse correlation with age: This suggests that the hepatocellular pattern of damage is more common in younger individuals, which could imply that it is a disease that affects younger people more frequently.\n3. Worst outcome: This implies that the hepatocellular pattern of damage has a negative impact on the outcome of the disease, suggesting that it is a serious condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hepatocellular pattern of damage\n2. Liver disease (implied by the mention of liver cells and liver damage)\n\nIt is important to note that the paragraph does not explicitly mention a specific disease name, but the context suggests that the discussion is related to liver disease."},
