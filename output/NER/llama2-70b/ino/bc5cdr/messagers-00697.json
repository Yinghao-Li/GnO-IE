Isopropyl - 6 - benzyloxy - 4 - methoxymethyl - beta - carboline - 3 - carboxylate (abecarrnil)\n\nThis is a single chemical compound, which contains several functional groups:\n\n* Isopropyl (a branched alkyl group)\n* Benzyloxy (a phenyl group with a methyl group attached to the benzene ring)\n* Methoxymethyl (a methyl group attached to a methoxy group, which is a hydroxyl group with a methyl group attached)\n* Beta-carboline (a heterocyclic ring containing a carbon atom and a nitrogen atom)\n* Carboxylate (a carboxylic acid group)\n\nSo, this compound contains five chemical entities: isopropyl, benzyloxy, methoxymethyl, beta-carboline, and carboxylate.\n\n2. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)\n\nThis is a single chemical entity, which is an amino acid with a side chain that contains a hydroxyl group and a branched carbon chain.\n\nTherefore, the total number of chemical entities in the paragraph is six:\n\n1.
