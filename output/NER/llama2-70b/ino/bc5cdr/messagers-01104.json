Urinary N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) - a marker of renal tubular injury.\n\nThese two entities clearly refer to disease markers or indicators of kidney damage, which is the main focus of the paragraph. The other two entities, SOD and CAT, are enzymes that protect against oxidative stress, but they are not directly related to disease in this context."},
