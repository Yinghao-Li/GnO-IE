Gamma Knife is a brand name for a type of stereotactic radiosurgery device that uses gamma radiation to treat various conditions, including brain tumors. The term \"Gamma Knife\" refers to the device itself, which is a physical entity that emits gamma radiation.\n2. Radiofrequency refers to the type of energy used in the treatment procedure. Radiofrequency is a form of electromagnetic radiation with a frequency range that can be used to heat or ablate tissue. In this context, the term \"radiofrequency\" refers to the energy used in the treatment procedure, which is a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are Gamma Knife and radiofrequency."},
