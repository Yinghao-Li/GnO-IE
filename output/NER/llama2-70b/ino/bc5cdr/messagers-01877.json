Striatum\n5. Amygdala\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. TBARS and superoxide generation are both measures of oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Oxidative stress has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders.\n2. The prefrontal cortex, striatum, and amygdala are all brain regions that are affected in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. The prefrontal cortex is involved in executive function, decision-making, and mood regulation, while the striatum is involved in motor control and reward processing. The amygdala is involved in emotional processing and fear response.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph suggests that increased oxidative stress in these brain regions may be associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders."},
