These models are used to study the effects of exercise and isoproterenol on the body. Therefore, they are not actual diseases, but rather experimental conditions designed to mimic certain physiological responses."},

Isoproterenol\n\nIsoproterenol is a chemical compound that is used as a beta-adrenergic agonist. It is a synthetic form of the hormone isoproterenol, which is produced by the adrenal glands.\n\n2. Body weight\n\nBody weight is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the paragraph as a parameter for determining the dose of isoproterenol to be administered to the animals.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Isoproterenol\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
