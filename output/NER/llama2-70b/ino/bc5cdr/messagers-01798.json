Graves' disease is a medical condition characterized by the overproduction of thyroid hormones, which can lead to symptoms such as rapid weight loss, nervousness, and irregular heartbeat. It is an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid gland to produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormones.\n2. ANCA positive carbimazole induced vasculitis is a rare side effect of the drug carbimazole, which is used to treat hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease. It is a type of vasculitis, a condition where the blood vessels become inflamed, which can lead to damage to various organs in the body. In this case, the patient developed ANCA positive carbimazole induced vasculitis as a complication of treatment for their Graves' disease."},
