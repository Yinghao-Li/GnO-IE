Parkinson's disease (PD) - The paragraph mentions \"levodopa therapy,\" which is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. Although the paragraph does not explicitly mention Parkinson's disease, it can be inferred from the context.\n2. Motor fluctuations - The paragraph mentions \"levodopa-induced motor fluctuations,\" which refers to the variations in motor symptoms that can occur in people with Parkinson's disease, especially after long-term use of levodopa medication.\n3. Dyskinesia - The paragraph mentions \"dyskinesia,\" which refers to involuntary movements that can occur as a side effect of long-term levodopa use in people with Parkinson's disease.\n4. Wearing-off - The paragraph mentions \"wearing-off,\" which refers to the decrease in the effectiveness of levodopa medication over time, leading to a return of Parkinson's symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Parkinson's disease (PD)\n2. Motor fluctuations\n3. Dyskinesia\n4. Wearing-off"},
