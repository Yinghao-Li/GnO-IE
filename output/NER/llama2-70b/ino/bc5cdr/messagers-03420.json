Identify the keywords: The keywords in the paragraph are \"Inorganic As,\" \"exposure,\" \"adverse health effects,\" and \"adulthood.\"\n2. Identify the entities: The entities in the paragraph are \"Inorganic As\" and \"adulthood.\"\n3. Determine the type of entities: \"Inorganic As\" is a substance, and \"adulthood\" is a stage of life.\n4. Identify the \"Disease\" entities: Since \"adverse health effects\" is a phrase that refers to negative impacts on health, we can identify it as a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Adverse health effects\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nAdverse health effects"},
