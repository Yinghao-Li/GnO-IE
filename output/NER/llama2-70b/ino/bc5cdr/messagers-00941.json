Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking and behavior, and a lack of motivation. It is a disease that affects the brain and can cause significant impairment in social and occupational functioning.\n2. Atypical antipsychotic agents are a class of medications used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. They work by blocking the action of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, such as dopamine and serotonin, which helps to reduce symptoms of psychosis.\n\nTherefore, both schizophrenia and atypical antipsychotic agents are related to the disease entity in the paragraph."},
