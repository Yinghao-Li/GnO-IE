    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given paragraph, the \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n1. QT prolongation\n2. Multichannel blockers\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. QT prolongation: QT prolongation is a condition where the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is longer than normal. It is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. Prolongation of the QT interval can be a sign of various heart conditions, such as arrhythmias, and can increase the risk of sudden death.\n2. Multichannel blockers: Multichannel blockers are a class of drugs that block the activity of multiple ion channels in the heart, leading to a prolongation of the QT interval. They are used to treat various cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Examples of multichannel blockers include quinidine, disopyramide, and amiodarone.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are QT prolongation and multichannel blockers, as they are both related to heart conditions and are mentioned in the context of the study aimed at detecting QT prolongation induced by multichannel blockers using FPD from MEA of hiPS-CMs."},
