Hyperalgesia refers to an increased sensitivity to pain, which can be a symptom of various diseases or conditions.\n2. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia is a condition where the use of opioids leads to an increased sensitivity to pain, which can be a side effect of opioid medication.\n\nTherefore, both \"hyperalgesia\" and \"opioid-induced hyperalgesia\" can be classified as \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},
