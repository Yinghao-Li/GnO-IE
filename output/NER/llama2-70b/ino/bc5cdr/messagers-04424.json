The paragraph discusses the effect of chronic doxorubicin administration on the ECG of freely moving BALB/c mice and the efficacy of ICRF-187 as a protective agent. Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, but it is not a disease entity. ECG (electrocardiogram) is a diagnostic test used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. ICRF-187 is a protective agent that is being investigated for its potential to prevent or reduce the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* None"},
