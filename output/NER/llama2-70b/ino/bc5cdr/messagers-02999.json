Mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I - IV\n3. Apoptosis-inducing factor\n4. Oxidative stress markers\n\nThese entities can be classified as \"Disease\" or \"Disorder\" because they are all related to abnormalities or disturbances in the normal functioning of the body. Cardiac disturbances refer to problems with the heart's function, while mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I - IV and apoptosis-inducing factor are all related to mitochondrial dysfunction, which can lead to various diseases. Oxidative stress markers are indicators of oxidative stress, which can also contribute to the development of various diseases."},
