Chronic administration of estrogen is a potential disease cause, as it is a prolonged exposure to a substance that can lead to negative health effects.\n2. Growth of large, hemorrhagic pituitary tumors is a disease outcome, as it is an abnormal growth that can cause various health problems, including hormonal imbalances, vision loss, and potentially life-threatening complications."},

Fischer 344 (F344) rat is not a chemical entity, but a breed of rat that is used in scientific research. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the animal model used for the study.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is estrogen."},
