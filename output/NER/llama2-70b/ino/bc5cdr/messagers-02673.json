Seizures are a symptom or a clinical manifestation of a disease or a neurological disorder. In this paragraph, seizures are mentioned as the health problem that occurred in four children.\n2. Incidence refers to the rate or frequency of occurrence of a disease or health problem in a population. In this paragraph, the incidence of seizures is given as 14.8%, which means that 14.8% of the children in the population studied experienced seizures.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Seizures and Incidence."},
