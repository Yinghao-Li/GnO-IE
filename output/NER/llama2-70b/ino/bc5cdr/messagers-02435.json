Sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) - SCEs are a type of chromosomal aberration that involves the exchange of genetic material between two sister chromatids.\n2. Proliferation rate index (PRI) - PRI is a measure of the rate at which cells are dividing and replicating their DNA.\n3. Mitotic Index - The mitotic index is a measure of the number of cells in a given population that are undergoing mitosis, which is the stage of cell division where chromosomes are replicated and separated.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs)\n* Proliferation rate index (PRI)\n* Mitotic Index"},
