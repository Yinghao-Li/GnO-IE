Amitriptyline is a chemical compound that is used as an antidepressant drug.\n2. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially life-threatening side effect of neuroleptic drugs, which include antipsychotics and certain antidepressants like amitriptyline.\n3. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur when certain medications, including antidepressants like amitriptyline, cause excessive levels of serotonin to accumulate in the body.\n4. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is involved in mood regulation and other physiological processes. It is a chemical messenger that transmits signals between neurons in the brain."},
