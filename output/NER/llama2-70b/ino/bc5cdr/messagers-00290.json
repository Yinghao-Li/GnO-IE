Chest pain is a symptom that can be indicative of a disease or medical condition, such as angina or myocardial infarction.\n2. Cocaine use is a risk factor for various medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and stroke.\n3. Tropinin I level is a diagnostic marker used to diagnose and monitor various cardiovascular conditions, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are chest pain, cocaine use, and tropinin I level."},

Chest pain is a symptom that can be indicative of a disease or medical condition, such as angina or myocardial infarction.\n2. Myocardial infarction (heart attack) is a medical condition that can cause chest pain and is relevant to the mention of tropinin I level in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are chest pain and myocardial infarction."},
