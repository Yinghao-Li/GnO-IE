ACE (Angiotensin-converting enzyme) - a protein that plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which regulates blood pressure.\n2. ARB (Angiotensin II receptor blocker) - a class of drugs that blocks the action of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.\n3. Potassium sparing agents - a class of drugs that help the kidneys retain potassium ions, which can help lower blood pressure.\n4.
