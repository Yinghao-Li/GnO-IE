Accelerated beating rhythm\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Arrhythmia is a disease characterized by an abnormal heart rhythm, which can be caused by various factors, including Ca2+ overload.\n* Accelerated beating rhythm is not a disease itself, but it can be a symptom of an underlying disease or condition, such as arrhythmia. In this paragraph, it is mentioned as a consequence of Ca2+ overload, which suggests that it is an abnormal condition."},
