Myopathic disease is a disease of the muscles, and the authors are discussing the efficacy of anabolizing steroids in treating this condition.\n2. Dystrophic injury refers to the damage or disorder of the muscle tissue, which is a common symptom of muscular dystrophy.\n3. Virility is not a disease, but it is mentioned in the context of the side effects of the drug on human health. The authors suggest that high dosage of anabolizing steroids cannot be carried out continuously because it affects virility."},
