Oligomenorrhea\n\nThese three entities can be classified as \"Disease\" or \"Disorder\" because they are medical conditions that affect the body and can cause symptoms or harm.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each entity:\n\n1. Hyperprolactinemia: This is a condition where the level of prolactin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, is abnormally high. It can cause symptoms such as galactorrhea (spontaneous milk production), amenorrhea (loss of menstrual period), and infertility.\n2. Amenorrhea: This is the absence of menstrual periods. It can be caused by various factors, including hyperprolactinemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid disorders, and premature ovarian failure.\n3. Oligomenorrhea: This is a condition where menstrual periods occur less frequently than normal. It can be caused by factors such as polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid disorders, and hyperprolactinemia.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
