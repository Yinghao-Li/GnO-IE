Plasticity - Plasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experience or learning. While it is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, it is often studied in the context of neuroplasticity, which involves changes in the brain's neural connections and chemistry.\n2. Sensory processing - Sensory processing refers to the way the brain processes sensory information from the environment. This process involves various chemicals and neurotransmitters that transmit and modulate sensory signals.\n3. Cerebellar sensory processing - The cerebellum is a part of the brain that plays a crucial role in sensory processing, including the processing of auditory, visual, and somatosensory (touch and movement) information. The cerebellum contains various chemicals and neurotransmitters that are involved in these processes.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Plasticity\n2. Sensory processing\n3. Cerebellar sensory processing"},

Plasticity - Plasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experience or learning, which can involve changes in the brain's chemical structure and function.\n2. Neurotransmitters - Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons in the brain.
