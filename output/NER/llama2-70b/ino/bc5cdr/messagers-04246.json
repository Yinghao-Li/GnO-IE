Cirrhosis is a disease that affects the liver and is characterized by the replacement of liver tissue with scar tissue.\n2. Renal dysfunction, also known as kidney dysfunction, refers to impaired kidney function, which can be caused by various diseases or disorders. In this paragraph, it is mentioned as a side effect of indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)."},
