Parkinson's disease (PD)\n\nLevodopa is a chemical compound that is used to treat Parkinson's disease. It is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps to replace the dopamine that is lost in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease, on the other hand, is a neurological disorder that affects movement and motor control. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a disease that is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Levodopa\n2.
