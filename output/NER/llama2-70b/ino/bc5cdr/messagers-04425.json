Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. It is considered a disease entity because it is a medication used to treat a disease or condition.\n2. ST interval is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. An abnormal ST interval can be a sign of various heart conditions, such as coronary artery disease, cardiac ischemia, or cardiac arrhythmias. In this paragraph, the ST interval is mentioned as being significantly widened, which could indicate a potential heart condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are Doxorubicin and ST interval."},
