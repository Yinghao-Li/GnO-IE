Identify the organ/tissue being discussed: urinary bladder\n2. Identify the condition/lesions being studied: cyclophosphamide-induced lesions\n3. Identify the species being studied: rat\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cyclophosphamide-induced lesions of the urinary bladder\n2. Urinary bladder\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the lesions that are induced by cyclophosphamide in the urinary bladder of rats."},

Cyclophosphamide-induced lesions\n\nThe term \"urinary bladder\" is not a disease entity, but rather a normal anatomical structure. The paragraph is discussing the effects of cyclophosphamide on the bladder, so the term \"cyclophosphamide-induced lesions\" is the most relevant disease entity in this context."},
