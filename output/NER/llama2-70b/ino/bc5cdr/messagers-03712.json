The paragraph discusses flurothyl seizure thresholds in mice treated neonatally with a single injection of monosodium glutamate (MSG) and the evaluation of experimental parameters in flurothyl seizure testing.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the paragraph implies that the mice are being studied as a model for seizure disorders, and that the research is aimed at understanding the effects of MSG on seizure threshold. Therefore, seizure disorders could be considered an indirect disease entity in this context."},
