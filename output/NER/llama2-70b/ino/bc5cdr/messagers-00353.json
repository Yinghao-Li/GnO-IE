    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. The first entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"microglia,\" which are a type of cell in the brain. Therefore, \"microglia\" is a biological entity.\n2. The next entity mentioned is \"PDN groups,\" which likely refers to \"perinatal depression\" groups, as the paragraph is discussing the effects of perinatal depression on the brain. Therefore, \"PDN groups\" is a psychological entity.\n3. The next entity mentioned is \"prefrontal cortex,\" which is a region of the brain.
