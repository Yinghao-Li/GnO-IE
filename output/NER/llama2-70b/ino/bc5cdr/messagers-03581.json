Myocardial fibrosis\n\nMyocardial fibrosis is a condition where there is an abnormal thickening and scarring of the heart muscle, which can lead to loss of cardiac function and potentially lead to heart failure. In this paragraph, myocardial fibrosis is mentioned as the outcome or effect of isoproterenol induction. Therefore, it can be classified as a disease entity."},

Isoproterenol\n\nIsoproterenol is a chemical compound that is used to induce myocardial fibrosis in the study. It is a synthetic catecholamine that acts as a beta-adrenergic agonist and can stimulate the heart to beat faster and stronger.\n\nTherefore, \"Isoproterenol\" is a chemical entity in the paragraph."},
