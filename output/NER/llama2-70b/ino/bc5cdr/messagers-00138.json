This implies that the rats had a disease or condition that caused an increase in these concentrations, which are indicative of kidney dysfunction or damage. Therefore, \"serum blood urea\" and \"creatinine concentrations\" can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this context."},

D-AmB (D-AmB 3 mg/kg) - D-AmB is a chemical compound, specifically a type of aminoglycoside antibiotic.\n2. NS-718 (NS-718 3 mg/kg) - NS-718 is a chemical compound, which is a negative control in this study.\n3. Serum - Serum is a fluid component of blood that contains various chemicals, including proteins, lipids, and metabolites.\n4. Blood urea - Urea is a chemical compound that is produced in the liver and excreted in the urine. It is also a metabolite that can be measured in the blood.\n5. Creatinine - Creatinine is a chemical compound that is produced in the muscles and excreted in the urine. It is also a metabolite that can be measured in the blood.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* D-AmB\n* NS-718\n* Urea\n* Creatinine"},
