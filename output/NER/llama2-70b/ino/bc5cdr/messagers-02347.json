Identify the symptoms:\n * Menstrual abnormalities\n * Weight gain\n * Muscle cramps/myalgias\n * Transaminase elevations\n2. Determine if any of the symptoms are diseases:\n * Menstrual abnormalities: Yes, this can be a symptom of various menstrual disorders or diseases.\n * Weight gain: No, weight gain is not a disease, but it can be a symptom of various medical conditions.\n * Muscle cramps/myalgias: No, muscle cramps and myalgias are not diseases, but they can be symptoms of various medical conditions.\n * Transaminase elevations: Yes, transaminase elevations can be a symptom of liver disease or damage.\n3. Identify the diseases associated with the symptoms:\n * Menstrual abnormalities: Menstrual disorders, such as amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, or menorrhagia\n * Transaminase elevations: Liver disease or damage, such as hepatitis or liver cirrhosis\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
