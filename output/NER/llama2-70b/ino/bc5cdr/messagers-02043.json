CD4 + T - cell counts\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Alcohol use is a disease because it is a harmful habit that can lead to various health problems, including liver damage, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.\n* CD4 + T - cell counts are a measure of the immune system's function, and low levels of CD4 + T cells are associated with a weakened immune system, which can make the body more susceptible to opportunistic infections and diseases.\n\nTherefore, both alcohol use and CD4 + T - cell counts are related to health and disease in this paragraph."},

CD4 + T - cell counts\n\nThe mention of CD4 + T - cell counts in the paragraph suggests that the study being discussed may have been conducted to investigate the relationship between alcohol use and immune system function in individuals with HIV/AIDS or other immune-compromising conditions. Therefore, CD4 + T - cell counts can be considered a disease entity in this context."},
