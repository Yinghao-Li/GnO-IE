It is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, but it is often treated with medications that affect blood pressure, such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta blockers.\n2. 15/HTN - This is a group name that refers to a subset of patients in the study who received a certain treatment (15% oxygen and hypertension medication).\n3. 90/HTN - This is another group name that refers to a subset of patients in the study who received a different treatment (90% oxygen and hypertension medication).\n4.
