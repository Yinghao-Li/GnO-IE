Nicotinic receptor: A protein found in the nervous system that responds to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and plays a role in various physiological processes, including muscle contraction and neurotransmission.\n2. Alpha-bungarotoxin: A toxin that binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are found in the nervous system. It is used as a tool in scientific research to study the nicotinic receptor and its function.\n3. Hippocampal: Relating to the hippocampus, a part of the brain that plays a major role in memory and spatial navigation.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the nicotinic receptor, alpha-bungarotoxin, and the hippocampus."},
