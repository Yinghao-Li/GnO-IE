Angio-oedema is a medical condition characterized by swelling of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. It is a potential side effect of ACE inhibitors, and patients with pre-existing angio-oedema are at a higher risk of experiencing adverse reactions to these medications. Therefore, angio-oedema can be classified as a disease entity in this paragraph.\n2. Adverse reactions refer to harmful or undesirable effects that can occur as a result of using a medication, in this case, ACE inhibitors. The paragraph highlights the possibility of adverse reactions occurring after long-term use of these medications, particularly in patients with pre-existing angio-oedema. Therefore, adverse reactions can also be classified as a disease entity in this paragraph."},

Therefore, I have removed adverse reactions from the list of disease entities."},
