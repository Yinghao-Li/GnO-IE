Serum potassium: \"Serum potassium\" refers to the level of potassium ions (K+) in the blood serum. Potassium is a chemical element with the symbol K and atomic number 19. It is an essential electrolyte that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including maintaining the body's water balance, transmitting nerve impulses, and regulating heart rhythm.\n2. Serum: \"Serum\" is the liquid portion of the blood that separates from the clot when blood coagulates. It contains various chemicals, including proteins, sugars, lipids, and electrolytes, such as potassium.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Potassium (K+)\n2. Serum"},
