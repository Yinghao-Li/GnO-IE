Bradycardia\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Syncope is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a sudden decrease in blood flow to the brain. It is a symptom of various medical conditions, such as heart disease, neurological disorders, or low blood pressure.\n* Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, usually defined as a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute. It can be a normal finding in healthy individuals, but it can also be a sign of various medical conditions, such as heart block, sinus node dysfunction, or medication side effects.\n\nIn the paragraph, syncope and bradycardia are reported as adverse effects of intranasal dexmedetomidine administration for sedation during a voiding cystourethrogram procedure in an 11-year-old girl. Therefore, they are considered \"Disease\" entities in this context."},
