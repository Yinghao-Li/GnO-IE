Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is discussing the effectiveness of levetiracetam treatment in reducing seizure frequency in cats.\n2. Identify the entities related to the main topic:\n * Levetiracetam\n * Seizure frequency\n * Cats\n3. Identify the entities that are diseases or medical conditions:\n * Seizure frequency (as it is a symptom of a neurological disorder)\n4. Identify the entities that are not diseases or medical conditions:\n * Levetiracetam (it is a medication)\n * Cats (they are the animals being treated, not diseases)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Seizure frequency"},
