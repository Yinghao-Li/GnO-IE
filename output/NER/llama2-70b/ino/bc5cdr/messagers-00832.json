PPARalpha is a protein that is encoded by the PPARA gene and is involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. The paragraph suggests that the effects of amiodarone are dependent on the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene, indicating that PPARalpha is also a chemical entity in this context."},

Amiodarone\n\nAmiodarone is a chemical compound that is used as an anti-arrhythmic drug. It is the only chemical entity that is explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. PPARalpha, although a protein, is not explicitly mentioned as a chemical entity in the paragraph, but rather as a gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism.
