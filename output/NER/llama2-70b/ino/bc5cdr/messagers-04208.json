Identify the mention of a disease or disorder:\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"Parkinson's disease\" and \"motor disability\" and \"dyskinesias\".\n2. Determine if the mention of the disease or disorder is a symptom or a diagnosis:\n\n\"Motor disability\" and \"dyskinesias\" can be symptoms of Parkinson's disease, while \"Parkinson's disease\" is a diagnosis.\n3. Identify the entities that correspond to the disease or disorder:\n\nThe entities that correspond to the disease or disorder are:\n\n* Parkinson's disease\n* Motor disability\n* Dyskinesias\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Parkinson's disease\n* Motor disability\n* Dyskinesias"},
