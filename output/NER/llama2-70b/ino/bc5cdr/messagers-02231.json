Post-necrotic tissue repair\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Fibrotic areas refer to the formation of scar tissue in the body, which can be a result of various diseases or injuries.\n2. Post-necrotic tissue repair refers to the body's natural healing process after cell death (necrosis) has occurred. This process can be a result of various diseases or injuries, and is often associated with fibrosis.\n\nTherefore, both fibrotic areas and post-necrotic tissue repair can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the given paragraph."},
