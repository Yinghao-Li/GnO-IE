HT (Hormone Therapy)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Menopause is a natural biological process that occurs in women, typically between the ages of 45 and 55, when the ovaries stop producing eggs and hormone levels decrease. It is not a disease, but it can cause various symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness.\n* Oestrogen deficiency is a condition that occurs when the levels of oestrogen hormone in the body are lower than normal. It can cause symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and bone loss.\n* HT (Hormone Therapy) is a medical treatment that involves taking hormones to replace those that the body is not producing or producing at lower levels. It is used to treat symptoms of menopause and oestrogen deficiency, and it can also help prevent osteoporosis.\n\nIn the paragraph, the authors are discussing a trial that analyzed subgroups of relatively healthy women taking combined continuous HT and oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The trial aimed to evaluate the effects of these treatments on various health outcomes."},
