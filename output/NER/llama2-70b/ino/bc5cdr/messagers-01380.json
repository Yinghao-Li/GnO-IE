GTN is a medication used to treat angina, heart failure, and hypertension. In this context, \"disease\" entities would refer to medical conditions that the patient may have, such as angina, heart failure, or hypertension. However, the paragraph does not mention any specific disease entities. It only describes the effect of the medication on the patient's blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nNo disease entities are mentioned in the paragraph."},
