Cardiac dysfunction is a disease entity as it refers to a impairment in the functioning of the heart, which can lead to various cardiovascular problems.\n2. Myocardial strain is a disease entity as it refers to a measure of the deformation of the heart muscle, which can be an indicator of cardiac dysfunction.\n3. High-sensitive cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a disease entity as it is a protein that is released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged, and its levels can be used to diagnose and monitor cardiac disease.\n\nTherefore, the three disease entities in the paragraph are cardiac dysfunction, myocardial strain, and high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (cTnT)."},

Myocardial strain is a disease entity as it refers to a measure of the deformation of the heart muscle, which can be an indicator of cardiac dysfunction.\n\nHigh-sensitive cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is not a disease entity in this context, as it is a protein that is released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged, but it is not a disease itself. It is a marker or indicator of cardiac damage or disease.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are cardiac dysfunction and myocardial strain."},
