It is a disease entity because it is a specific medical condition with a distinct set of symptoms and causes.\n* IT chemotherapy, also known as immunotherapy, is a type of cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to fight cancer. It is a disease entity because it is a specific medical intervention with a distinct set of mechanisms and effects.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are axonal neuropathy and IT chemotherapy."},
