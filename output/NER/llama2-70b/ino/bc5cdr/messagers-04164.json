It is a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent that can be used to treat various types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer. It works by alkylating DNA, which prevents the cancer cells from reproducing and eventually leads to their death.\n\nTherefore, cyclophosphamide is the chemical entity in the paragraph."},
