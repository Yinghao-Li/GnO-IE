It is a disease caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which codes for a protein involved in copper transport.\n* Penicillamine-related side effects are adverse reactions that can occur when a patient takes penicillamine, a medication used to treat Wilson's disease. These side effects can include gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rashes, and neurological problems.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Wilson's disease and penicillamine-related side effects."},
