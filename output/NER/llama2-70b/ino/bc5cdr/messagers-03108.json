Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death, which can be a disease or a symptom of various diseases.\n2. Cardiac histology refers to the study of the structure and function of the heart tissue, which can be affected by various cardiovascular diseases.\n3. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay is a technique used to detect DNA fragmentation, which is a hallmark of apoptosis.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Apoptosis, Cardiac histology, and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay."},
