Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Heterozygous atypical silent genotype: This is a genetic condition that affects the activity of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme.\n2. Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase: This is a condition where the activity of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme in the patient's plasma is lower than normal.\n\nThe other terms in the paragraph, such as butyrylthiocholine (BTC), benzoylcholine, dibucaine, and fluoride numbers, are not diseases but rather substances or measurements that are related to the diagnosis or treatment of the genetic condition."},
