Electrocardiogram (ECG) - ECG is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart, which is a chemical process involving ions and electrolytes.\n2. Ventricular tachycardia - Ventricular tachycardia is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that can be caused by chemical imbalances in the body, such as changes in potassium, magnesium, or calcium levels.\n3. Fibrillation - Fibrillation is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that can be caused by chemical imbalances in the body, such as changes in potassium, magnesium, or calcium levels.\n4. QRS prolongation - QRS prolongation is a condition where the QRS complex in the ECG is longer than normal, which can be caused by chemical imbalances in the body, such as changes in potassium, magnesium, or calcium levels.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
