Identify the cells being discussed:\n * Astrocytes\n * Microglia cells\n2. Determine if these cells are affected by a disease or condition:\n * Yes, the paragraph mentions that the cells are transformed, which implies that they are not healthy or normal.\n3. Identify the disease or condition affecting the cells:\n * The paragraph does not explicitly mention a disease or condition, but based on the context, it can be inferred that the cells are affected by some kind of neurodegenerative disorder or injury.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Astrocytes\n2. Microglia cells\n3. Neurodegenerative disorder or injury (implied but not explicitly mentioned)"},
