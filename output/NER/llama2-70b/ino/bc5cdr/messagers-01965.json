Cerebral edema is a condition where there is an accumulation of fluid in the brain, leading to swelling. It is a chemical change in the brain tissue caused by an imbalance of fluids.\n2. Intracranial hypertension is a condition where there is an increase in pressure inside the skull, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including chemical changes in the brain.\n\nTherefore, both cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension are chemical entities in the paragraph."},
