Therefore, \"insulin resistance\" is a \"Disease\" entity.\n2. \"clozapine\" - This is a medication used to treat schizophrenia. It is not a disease entity.\n3. \"olanzapine\" - This is a medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is not a disease entity.\n4. \"risperidone\" - This is a medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
