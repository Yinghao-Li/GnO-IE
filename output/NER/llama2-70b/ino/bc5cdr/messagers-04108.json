Bepridil\n\nBepridil is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat various medical conditions, including angina pectoris and hypertension. It is a calcium channel blocker that works by relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels, which leads to increased blood flow and decreased blood pressure. Bepridil is the chemical entity that is being studied in the paragraph for its ability to induce bradycardia.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Bepridil"},
