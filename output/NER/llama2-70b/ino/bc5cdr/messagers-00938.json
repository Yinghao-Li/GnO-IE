Fibrosis is a disease that refers to the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue, which can lead to scarring and loss of organ function. In this paragraph, fibrosis is mentioned as a condition found in the animals killed on day 30.\n2. Renal function recovery refers to the restoration of normal kidney function, which had been impaired or damaged prior to the recovery. In this paragraph, renal function recovery is mentioned as a positive outcome in the animals killed on day 30, despite the presence of fibrosis.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are fibrosis and renal function recovery."},
