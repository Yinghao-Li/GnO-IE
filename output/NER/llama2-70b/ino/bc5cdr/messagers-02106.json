High levels of creatinine in the blood can be a sign of kidney disease.\n4. \"range 0.7-4.9 mg/dl\" - This range refers to the range of creatinine levels in the blood, which can be an indicator of kidney function.\n5. \"gender\" - Gender is not a disease.\n6. \"age\" - Age is not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Kidney disease (mentioned in the context of creatinine levels)\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nDisease entities:\n\n1.
