Fatal bacterial infections\n\nThe paragraph mentions the possibility of fatal bacterial infections related to bortezomib plus high-dose dexamethasone in elderly patients, which implies that bacterial infections are a potential health problem that can be fatal in certain cases. Therefore, \"bacterial infections\" and \"fatal bacterial infections\" are both considered \"Disease\" entities."},

Fatal bacterial infections\n\nThe term \"bacterial infections\" is still relevant, but the mention of \"fatal\" specifically highlights the severity of the condition and the potential for it to be a life-threatening disease. Therefore, \"fatal bacterial infections\" is the most relevant entity that clearly refers to a disease in the given paragraph."},
