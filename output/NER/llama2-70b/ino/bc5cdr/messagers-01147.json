Fanconi's anemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of blood cells. It is a disease that affects the bone marrow and leads to anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.\n2. Androgens are a class of hormones that are used to treat Fanconi's anemia. They are not a disease entity in this context, but rather a treatment for the disease.\n3. Corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland. They are used to treat a variety of conditions, including Fanconi's anemia. They are not a disease entity in this context, but rather a treatment for the disease.\n4. Transfusions are a medical procedure in which blood or its components are transferred from one person to another. They are not a disease entity in this context, but rather a treatment for the disease.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is Fanconi's anemia."},
