Intracellular vacuoles are small, membrane-bound structures within cells that can contain various chemical substances, such as ions, metabolic waste products, or signaling molecules.\n3. Smooth muscle cells are cells that make up the muscular layer of blood vessels and are responsible for contraction and relaxation of the vessel wall. They are composed of various chemical components, including proteins, lipids, and other biomolecules.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the given paragraph are small arteries, intracellular vacuoles, and smooth muscle cells."},
