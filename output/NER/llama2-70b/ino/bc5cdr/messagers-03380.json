Ozone (O3) - Ozone is a chemical compound composed of three oxygen atoms (O3). It is a toxic gas that can cause respiratory problems and irritate the eyes, nose, and throat. In the paragraph, \"ozone\" is mentioned as a chemical entity.\n2. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) - Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollutant that consists of small particles, typically less than 100 micrometers in diameter. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These particles can come from various sources, including industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and natural sources like wildfires. In the paragraph, \"fine particulate matter\" is mentioned as a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Ozone (O3)\n2. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)"},
