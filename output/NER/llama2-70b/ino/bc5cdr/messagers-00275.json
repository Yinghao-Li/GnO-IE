Torsade de pointes is a specific type of ventricular fibrillation that can lead to sudden death, while QT prolongation is a prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram, which can increase the risk of developing Torsade de pointes and other arrhythmias.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Torsade de pointes and QT prolongation."},
