It is a disease entity in the paragraph because it is the condition being treated with methylprednisolone therapy.\n2. Methylprednisolone (MP) therapy is a treatment for RA, and it is a disease entity in the paragraph because it is the intervention being studied.\n3. Decline in pulse rate is a side effect of methylprednisolone therapy and is a disease entity in the paragraph because it is an outcome being measured."},
