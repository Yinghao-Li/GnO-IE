Indomethacin groups\n\nThe control group is not a disease entity, as it is a reference group used for comparison.\n\nThe indomethacin groups, on the other hand, are being studied for their response to the drug indomethacin. Therefore, the indomethacin groups are not disease entities either.\n\nThe paragraph also mentions two phenomena:\n\n1. Increased numbers of mast cells in the mucosa\n2. Penetration of lanthanum nitrate through intercellular areas of the epithelium\n\nNeither of these phenomena can be considered a disease entity, as they are merely observations or effects of the drug being studied.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
