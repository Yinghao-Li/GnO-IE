Taussig-Bing malformation\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Isotretinoin embryopathy is a disease caused by exposure to isotretinoin, a medication used to treat acne, during pregnancy. It can result in various congenital anomalies.\n* Bilateral anotia is a condition where there is a absence of the external ear on both sides.\n* Taussig-Bing malformation is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by a combination of heart defects, including pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, and aortic arch hypoplasia.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Isotretinoin embryopathy, Bilateral anotia, and Taussig-Bing malformation."},
