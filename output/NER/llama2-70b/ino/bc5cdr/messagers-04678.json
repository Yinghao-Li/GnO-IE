D-glucarate is a chemical compound, specifically a sugar acid, that is used as a medication to protect the kidneys from damage caused by certain drugs.\n2. Antibiotics are a class of chemical compounds that are used to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms, such as bacteria. In this paragraph, the author is referring to basic antibiotics, which are a specific class of antibiotics that have a basic pH.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are D-glucarate and basic antibiotics."},

The term \"administration\" is also not a chemical entity, as it refers to the act of giving a substance to a patient, rather than the substance itself.\n\nTherefore, the revised list of chemical entities in the paragraph is:\n\n1.
