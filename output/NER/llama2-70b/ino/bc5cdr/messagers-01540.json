However, it is not explicitly stated in the paragraph that the animals in the study had cancer, so it's unclear whether \"DOX\" can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is that there are no clear disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},

Therefore, \"DOX\" is listed as a disease entity with some uncertainty."}
