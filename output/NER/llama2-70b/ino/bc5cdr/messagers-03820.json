Barbiturate anesthesia is a medical treatment, and control-fed rats are a reference group used for comparison in scientific research. Myocardial contractile indices refer to the ability of the heart muscle to contract and pump blood effectively, and depression of these indices suggests a potential disease or disorder. Barium-exposed rats are also a disease model, as exposure to barium can cause cardiovascular problems."},
