Asystole is a medical condition characterized by a complete absence of heartbeat, which can also be a side effect of lidocaine.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are lidocaine, hypotension, and asystole."},

Lidocaine is a chemical drug used as a local anesthetic.\n\nThe other two entities mentioned in the paragraph, hypotension and asystole, are medical conditions that can be side effects of lidocaine, but they are not chemical entities themselves.
