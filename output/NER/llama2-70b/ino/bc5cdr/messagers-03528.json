Hypertrophied hearts: This is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened, which can lead to various cardiovascular problems.\n2. Increased ornithine decarboxylase activity: This is a biochemical change that occurs in the body, specifically in the heart, and is associated with various diseases, including hypertension and heart failure.\n\nTherefore, both \"hypertrophied hearts\" and \"increased ornithine decarboxylase activity\" can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},

Hypertrophied hearts: This is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened, which can lead to various cardiovascular problems. It is a disease entity that is directly mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nThe other entity, \"increased ornithine decarboxylase activity,\" is not a disease entity in itself, but rather a biochemical change that can be associated with various diseases. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the topic of disease in the paragraph, and can be removed from the list of disease entities."},

Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) - an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ornithine to putrescine.\n2.

Putrescine - a polyamine that is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation.\n4. Hypertrophied hearts - hearts that have become enlarged as a result of hypertrophy, a condition in which the heart muscle cells increase in size in response to increased workload or pressure.\n\nI hope this helps!
