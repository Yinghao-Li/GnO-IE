Nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor\n\nThese are the chemical entities in the paragraph because they are all molecules or molecular structures that are involved in the regulation of gene expression. PPARalpha is a protein that acts as a transcription factor, ligand is a small molecule that binds to PPARalpha and activates its activity, and nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor is a class of proteins that regulate gene expression in response to hormones and other signaling molecules."},

Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha (PPARalpha)\n\nThese are the only two entities in the paragraph that clearly refer to chemicals or chemical structures. The term \"nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor\" refers to a class of proteins that regulate gene expression, but it does not specifically refer to a chemical entity."},
