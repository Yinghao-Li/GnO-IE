Microfilarial load\n\nThe term \"microfilarial load\" refers to the quantity or amount of microfilariae present in a subject's body. Microfilariae are tiny, immature parasitic worms that are present in the bloodstream of infected individuals. Therefore, \"microfilarial load\" can be considered a chemical entity as it represents a measure of the amount of a specific substance (microfilariae) present in the body."},
