Nephrotoxicity is a disease entity as it refers to the damage caused to the kidneys by the drug.\n2. Symptoms are a disease entity as they are the manifestations of the disease or condition that the patient is experiencing.\n3. Laboratory values are not typically considered a disease entity, but in this context, they are being used to assess the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, they can be considered a disease entity in this context."},
