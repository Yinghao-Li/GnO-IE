Drug: A drug is a chemical substance that is used to prevent, diagnose, or treat a disease or medical condition. In this paragraph, the drug is the cause of hepatotoxicity.\n2. Hepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxicity refers to the damage caused to the liver due to exposure to a toxic substance, such as a drug. In this paragraph, hepatotoxicity is the result of the drug-induced damage to the liver.\n3. Hepatitis: Hepatitis is a medical condition characterized by the inflammation of the liver. In this paragraph, hepatitis is the consequence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in this paragraph are the drug that causes hepatotoxicity, the hepatotoxicity itself, and the hepatitis that results from it."},
