Reduced NRVMs viability\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Myocardial injury refers to damage or injury to the heart muscle, which can lead to various cardiovascular problems.\n* Reduced NRVMs viability refers to a decrease in the ability of nucleated red blood cells (NRVMs) to function properly, which can lead to anemia or other blood-related disorders.\n\nTherefore, both myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},

Myocardial injury\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Myocardial injury refers to damage or injury to the heart muscle, which can lead to various cardiovascular problems. This is a clear reference to a disease or medical condition.\n\nThe mention of reduced NRVMs viability is not a clear reference to a disease, as it could be a temporary or non-pathological condition. Therefore, it is not included in the revised list of \"Disease\" entities."},
