TBM (Tubulo-Bowel Mucosa)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* NSAIDs-associated ATIN is a disease caused by the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which leads to acute inflammation in the tubules and interstitium of the kidney.\n* Granular immune complex is a disease entity that refers to the accumulation of immune complexes in the kidney, which can cause inflammation and damage to the kidney tissues.\n* TBM (Tubulo-Bowel Mucosa) is not a disease entity, but rather a term used to describe the tissue that lines the tubules and bowel. However, in the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned as a location where the granular immune complex deposits are present."},
