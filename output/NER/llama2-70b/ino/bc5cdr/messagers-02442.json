It is a chronic condition that requires continuous management and care.\n* Levodopa therapy is a treatment for Parkinson's disease that involves taking the medication levodopa to manage the symptoms of the disease. In this paragraph, the patients have been on uninterrupted levodopa therapy for at least 6 months, indicating that they have been receiving continuous treatment for their Parkinson's disease."},
