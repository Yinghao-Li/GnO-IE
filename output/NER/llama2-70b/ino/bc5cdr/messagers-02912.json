Autonomic neuropathy\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Peripheral neuropathy is a disease that affects the peripheral nervous system, specifically the nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body.\n2. Neuropathy is a broader term that refers to any disease or disorder that affects the nervous system.\n3. Sensory neuropathy refers to damage to the nerves that transmit sensory information, such as pain, temperature, and touch.\n4. Motor neuropathy refers to damage to the nerves that control muscle movement.\n5. Autonomic neuropathy refers to damage to the nerves that control involuntary functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.\n\nIn the paragraph, the disease entity \"peripheral neuropathy\" is mentioned first, followed by the symptoms of the disease, which include sensory, motor, and autonomic neuropathy. Therefore, all five entities are relevant to the paragraph."},
