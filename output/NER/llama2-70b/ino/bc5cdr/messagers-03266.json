Lithium-fed PKCa KO mice (lithium-fed protein kinase C alpha knockout mice)\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this paragraph, the author is comparing the levels of urinary sodium, potassium, and calcium in two groups of mice: wild-type mice fed lithium (lithium-fed WT) and protein kinase C alpha knockout mice fed lithium (lithium-fed PKCa KO). The comparison is being made to investigate the effect of lithium on these mice, with the assumption that lithium may cause changes in the levels of these electrolytes. Therefore, both groups of mice are considered \"disease\" entities in this context, as they are being studied for their response to lithium treatment."},
