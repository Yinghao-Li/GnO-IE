Identify the keywords related to disease:\n * Hypertensive response\n * Systolic blood pressure\n * Diastolic blood pressure\n2. Identify the entities mentioned in the context of the keywords:\n * 30 patients\n3. Determine whether the entities are diseases or not:\n * 30 patients is a group of people, not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypertensive response\n\nThe paragraph describes a study in which a hypertensive response occurred in 30 patients (1%) during dobutamine stress echocardiography. The hypertensive response is the disease entity in this context."},
