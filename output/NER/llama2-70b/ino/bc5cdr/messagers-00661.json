Treatment failure refers to the inability of the medical treatment to effectively manage or cure the underlying disease or condition.\n2. Enucleation refers to the surgical removal of the eye, which is typically performed as a last resort when other treatments have failed.\n3. Histological examination refers to the study of tissue samples under a microscope to diagnose or monitor diseases.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
