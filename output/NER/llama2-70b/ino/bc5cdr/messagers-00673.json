Diabetes mellitus is a chemical entity because it is a disease that affects the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels. It is a metabolic disorder that can lead to a variety of complications, including damage to the eyes, kidneys, and nerves.\n2. Glaucoma is a chemical entity because it is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which can lead to vision loss and blindness. It is often associated with increased pressure in the eye, which can be caused by a buildup of fluid.\n3. Smoking (heavy) is a chemical entity because it involves the inhalation of chemicals, such as nicotine and tar, which can have harmful effects on the body. Prolonged exposure to these chemicals can increase the risk of various health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems.\n\nI hope this helps!
