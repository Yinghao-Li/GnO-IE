H-2 blockers (a class of drugs that includes ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine, and cimetidine)\n2. Omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor drug)\n3. Sucralfate (a medication that binds to ulcers and protects them from further damage)\n4. Milk\n5. Alkali (a substance that raises the pH of a solution, such as baking soda or antacids)\n6. Calcium (a chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20, which is found in milk and is involved in the syndrome)\n7. Hypercalcemia (a condition in which there is too much calcium in the blood)\n8. Alkalosis (a condition in which there is too much alkali in the blood)\n9.
