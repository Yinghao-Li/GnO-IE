Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS): EPS refers to a group of symptoms that are associated with the use of certain medications, such as antipsychotics. EPS can include movement disorders, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, as well as other symptoms such as dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. EPS is a disease entity because it is a recognized medical condition that can cause harm to patients.\n2. Adverse events: Adverse events refer to any undesirable or harmful effects that occur during the use of a medication or medical treatment. Adverse events can include a wide range of symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness, as well as more serious conditions, such as allergic reactions, cardiovascular events, and liver damage. Adverse events are a disease entity because they can cause harm to patients and may require medical intervention."},
