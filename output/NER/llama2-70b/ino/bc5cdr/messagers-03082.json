Brain oxidative stress\n\nKindling is a process of gradual development or progression of a disease or condition, often used to describe the progression of neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Cognitive impairment refers to a decline in mental function, such as memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with problem-solving. Brain oxidative stress refers to the damage caused to brain cells due to an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. All three entities can be classified as diseases or medical conditions."},
