They should not be classified as \"Disease\" entities.\n3. \"patients\" - This term refers to individuals who are suffering from a disease or medical condition. In this context, it should be classified as a \"Disease\" entity.\n4. \"controls\" - This term refers to individuals who do not have the disease or medical condition being studied. They are being used as a comparison group to contrast with the patients. \"Controls\" should not be classified as a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* abnormal left ventricular filling\n* patients\n\nThe entities that are not \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n* resting and peak exercise\n* controls"},
