GSSG (glutathione disulfide) - a chemical compound composed of two glutathione molecules linked together by a disulfide bond.\n2. Hepatocytes - cells that make up the liver tissue.\n3. Oxidant stress - a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. ROS can damage cellular structures and lead to various diseases.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are GSSG, hepatocytes, and oxidant stress (ROS)."},
