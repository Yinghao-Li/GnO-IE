Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome - This is a medical condition caused by the obstruction of the superior vena cava, a major vein that carries blood from the head, neck, and upper limbs to the heart. It is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, but rather a medical condition that can have chemical implications, such as changes in blood chemistry or electrolyte imbalances.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the given paragraph is:\n\n1. Electrolyte - This refers to electrically charged particles, such as ions or charged molecules, that are present in the body's fluids and play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contractions. Electrolytes can become imbalanced in conditions such as SVC syndrome, leading to serious complications."},
