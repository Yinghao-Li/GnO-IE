Identify the keywords related to disease:\n\nIn this paragraph, the keywords related to disease are:\n\n* Cardiotoxicity\n* Isoproterenol\n* Solidago virgaurea extract\n2. Identify the entities that are associated with the disease:\n\nThe entities associated with the disease in this paragraph are:\n\n* Rats (as the experimental model)\n* Isoproterenol (as the substance that induces cardiotoxicity)\n3. Identify the disease entity:\n\nThe disease entity in this paragraph is:\n\n* Cardiotoxicity\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cardiotoxicity\n* Isoproterenol (as the cause of cardiotoxicity)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the conditions or disorders that are associated with the heart and are caused by the administration of isoproterenol."},
