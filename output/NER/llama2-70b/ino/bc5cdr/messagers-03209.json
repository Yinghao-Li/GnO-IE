VTD regimen: VTD is a chemotherapy regimen consisting of three drugs: Velcade (bortezomib), thalidomide, and dexamethasone. Therefore, VTD regimen is a chemical entity.\n2. Bortezomib: Velcade (bortezomib) is a proteasome inhibitor, which is a type of chemotherapy drug. Therefore, bortezomib is a chemical entity.\n3. Thalidomide: Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug, which is also a type of chemotherapy drug. Therefore, thalidomide is a chemical entity.\n4. Dexamethasone: Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid drug, which is a type of steroid hormone. Therefore, dexamethasone is a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* VTD regimen\n* Bortezomib\n* Thalidomide\n* Dexamethasone"},
