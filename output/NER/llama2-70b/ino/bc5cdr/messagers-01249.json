Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\n\nThese are all names of medical conditions or proteins that are associated with various diseases. Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme that is involved in the immune system and is often elevated in conditions such as inflammation and infection. Proteinase-3 is a proteolytic enzyme that is involved in the breakdown of proteins and is associated with various diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cystic fibrosis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is a type of autoantibody that is produced in response to the immune system attacking the body's own neutrophils, and is associated with diseases such as autoimmune vasculitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome."},
