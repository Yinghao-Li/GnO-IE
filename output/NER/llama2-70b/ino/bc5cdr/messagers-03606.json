Thiabendazole (a drug)\n\nExplanation:\n\nJaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes caused by an excess of bilirubin in the blood. It is a symptom of various diseases, such as liver disease, gallstones, and pancreatitis. In this paragraph, jaundice is mentioned as the man's symptom, indicating that he has developed a disease.\n\nThiabendazole is a drug used to treat parasitic infections, and it is not a disease. However, it is mentioned in the paragraph as the possible cause of the man's jaundice, as he developed the symptom two weeks after exposure to the drug. Therefore, thiabendazole is also a \"Disease\" entity in this context, as it may be the cause of the man's jaundice."},
