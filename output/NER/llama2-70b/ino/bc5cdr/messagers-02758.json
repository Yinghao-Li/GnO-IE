HR (Heart Rate) - HR is a measure of the number of times the heart beats per minute, and it is a chemical entity as it is a physiological measure of the body's functioning.\n2. Dysrhythmia - Dysrhythmia is an abnormal heart rhythm, which can be caused by various chemical imbalances in the body, such as changes in electrolyte levels or drug interactions. Therefore, it can be considered a chemical entity.\n3. Asystole - Asystole is a condition where the heart stops beating, and it is a chemical entity as it is a result of changes in the body's chemical balance.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* HR\n* Dysrhythmia\n* Asystole"},
