Theophylline is a chemical compound, specifically a xanthine alkaloid, that is used as a bronchodilator in medicine.\n2. Serum is the liquid portion of blood that separates from the clot when blood coagulates. It contains various proteins, nutrients, and waste products.\n3. Protein is a macromolecule composed of amino acids that performs various functions in the body, including transporting molecules and catalyzing biochemical reactions.\n4. Dialysis is a medical process that uses a semipermeable membrane to separate molecules from a solution, in this case, to measure the binding of theophylline to serum proteins."},
