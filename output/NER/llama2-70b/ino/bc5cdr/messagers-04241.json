Arthralgia and sensory neuropathy are both adverse effects (side effects) of the chemical substance being studied. They are not chemical entities in themselves, but they are related to the chemical substance being tested.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* 225 mg/m2\n* 250 mg/m2\n\nI hope this helps!
