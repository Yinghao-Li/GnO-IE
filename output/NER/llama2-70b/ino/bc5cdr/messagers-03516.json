Terbutaline\n\nTerbutaline is a chemical compound that is used as a bronchodilator in the treatment of bronchial asthma. It is a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, which means it works by stimulating the beta-2 receptors in the lungs to relax the smooth muscle and dilate the airways, making it easier to breathe. Terbutaline is available in various formulations, including tablets, inhalers, and injectable solutions. It is typically used as a rescue medication to relieve acute bronchospasm, but it can also be used as a maintenance medication to prevent bronchospasm from occurring in the first place.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
