Drugs: These are chemical substances that are used to treat medical conditions. They are composed of specific molecules that interact with biological systems to produce a therapeutic effect.\n2. AV node: The atrioventricular node (AV node) is a small group of cells located in the heart that acts as a electrical relay station between the atria and the ventricles. It is responsible for slowing down the electrical impulses that pass through it, allowing the ventricles to fill with blood before they contract.\n3. Peripheral circulation: The peripheral circulation refers to the circulation of blood in the blood vessels outside of the heart and lungs. It includes the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins that carry blood to and from the body's tissues."},
