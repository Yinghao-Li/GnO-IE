Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a disease entity because it is a medical condition that affects the kidneys and can lead to kidney failure.\n* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not a disease entity, but rather a class of drugs that are used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. However, long-term use of NSAIDs has been linked to an increased risk of ESRD, making it a relevant disease entity in the context of the paragraph."},
