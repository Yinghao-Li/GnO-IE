Creatinine is a chemical waste product produced by muscle metabolism and is commonly measured in blood tests to assess kidney function.\n2. Albumin is a type of protein found in blood plasma that can be used as a marker of kidney function. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio is a measure of the amount of albumin present in urine, which can indicate kidney damage or disease.\n3. Leukocytes (white blood cells) are a type of blood cell that can be present in urine in certain conditions, such as urinary tract infections or kidney disease.
