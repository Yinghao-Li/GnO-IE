Phosphorylated Smad3: This is a protein that has undergone a chemical modification called phosphorylation.\n2. Immunoprecipitation: This is a chemical process that involves using antibodies to isolate specific proteins from a sample.\n3. Western blotting: This is a laboratory technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample, which involves separating proteins by size using gel electrophoresis and then transferring them to a membrane for detection.\n4. Confocal microscopy: This is a technique used to create high-resolution images of samples, which involves using a laser to scan the sample and create a three-dimensional image.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Phosphorylated Smad3\n* Antibodies\n* Gel electrophoresis buffers\n* Membrane\n* Laser\n\nI hope this helps!
