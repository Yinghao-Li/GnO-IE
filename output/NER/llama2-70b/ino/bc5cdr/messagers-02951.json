Coefficient of variation (CV)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a statistical measure that is used to assess the reproducibility of a measurement or a test. It is a chemical entity because it is a mathematical concept used in statistics and data analysis.\n2. Coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure that is used to quantify the variability of a measurement or a dataset. It is a chemical entity because it is a mathematical concept used in statistics and data analysis.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities in the given paragraph are ICC and CV."},

Coefficient of variation (CV)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure that is used to quantify the variability of a measurement or a dataset. It is a chemical entity because it is a mathematical concept used in statistics and data analysis, and it is commonly used in chemical research to describe the variability of experimental data."},
