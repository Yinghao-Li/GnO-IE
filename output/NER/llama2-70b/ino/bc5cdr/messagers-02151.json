Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is discussing the effects of a drug (morphine) and a combination of drugs (morphine and CNSB002) on pain relief.\n2. Identify the types of pain being discussed: The paragraph mentions two types of pain: inflammatory and neuropathic pain.\n3. Identify the entities associated with each type of pain:\n * Inflammatory pain: The paragraph mentions \"inflammatory models\" in which the pain is induced.\n * Neuropathic pain: The paragraph mentions \"neuropathic models\" in which the pain is induced.\n4. Identify the \"Disease\" entities: The \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are the conditions or models that are associated with the pain, namely:\n * Inflammatory models\n * Neuropathic models\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Inflammatory models\n2. Neuropathic models"},
