Polyneuropathy is a disease that affects the peripheral nervous system and is characterized by damage to multiple nerves.\n2. Motor loss refers to the loss of muscle function or movement, which can be a symptom of various neurological diseases or disorders.\n3. Thiotepa combination chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer that involves the use of a combination of drugs, including thiotepa, to destroy cancer cells. However, it can also have adverse effects on the nervous system, as described in the paragraph."},

Thiotepa is a chemical compound used in chemotherapy.\n2. Intrathecal refers to the method of administration of the chemotherapy drugs, which involves injecting them directly into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord. In this context, intrathecal is not a chemical entity but a route of administration, but it is related to the chemical entities being administered."},
