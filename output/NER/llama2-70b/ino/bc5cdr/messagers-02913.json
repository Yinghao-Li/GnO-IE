Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - MRI is a medical imaging technique that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. It does not contain any chemical entities.\n2. Spine - The spine is a column of vertebrae that runs down the middle of the back, extending from the base of the skull to the tailbone. It is made up of bones, ligaments, and other tissues, but does not contain any chemical entities.\n3. C2 - C2 is the second cervical vertebra, which is located in the neck region of the spine. It is a bone and does not contain any chemical entities.\n4. C6 - C6 is the sixth cervical vertebra, which is located in the lower neck region of the spine. It is also a bone and does not contain any chemical entities.\n5. Subacute combined degeneration - This is a medical condition that affects the spine and is characterized by degenerative changes in the discs and joints of the spine. It does not contain any chemical entities.\n\nTherefore, there are no chemical entities in the given paragraph."},
