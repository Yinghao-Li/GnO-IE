Methyldopa-induced hemolytic anemia\n\nThe paragraph mentions that the patient was diagnosed with hemolytic anemia, which is a disease characterized by the destruction of red blood cells. The phrase \"methyldopa-induced\" suggests that the hemolytic anemia was caused by the patient's use of methyldopa, a medication used to treat high blood pressure. Therefore, \"methyldopa-induced hemolytic anemia\" can also be considered a disease entity in this paragraph."},

Hemolytic anemia\n\nThe mention of \"near-syncope\" could potentially refer to a disease or condition, but it's not clear from the context whether it's directly related to the patient's hemolytic anemia or not. Therefore, I've removed it from the list of disease entities."},

Methyldopa\n\nMethyldopa is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat high blood pressure. It is a dopamine receptor agonist, which means it works by mimicking the action of dopamine in the brain to help regulate blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, \"methyldopa\" is a chemical entity in the paragraph."},
