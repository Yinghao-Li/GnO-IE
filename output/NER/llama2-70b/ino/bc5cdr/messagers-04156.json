It is a malignant disease.\n2. Renal pelvis - This is the area where the kidney meets the ureter, and it is where the cancer has developed.\n3. Cyclophosphamide therapy - This is a type of chemotherapy that was used to treat a nonmalignant disease.\n4. Nonmalignant disease - This refers to a disease that is not cancerous.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Invasive carcinoma\n* Nonmalignant disease"},
