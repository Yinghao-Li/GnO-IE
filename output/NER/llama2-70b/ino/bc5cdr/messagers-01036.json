QT prolongation\n\nThis is a medical condition that refers to an abnormal prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram. It can be a sign of various heart conditions, including arrhythmias, and can increase the risk of sudden death.\n\nTherefore, the entity \"QT prolongation\" can be classified as a Disease entity."},
