QT prolongation (a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat)\n2. Bradycardia (a condition where the heart rate is slower than normal)\n3. Dizziness (a symptom of a physical or mental condition, often described as a feeling of lightheadedness or unsteadiness)\n4.
