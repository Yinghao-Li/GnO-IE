Anti-dopaminergic effect\n\nThe term \"anti-dopaminergic effect\" refers to the ability of a substance to block or reduce the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including mood regulation and motivation. This term is often used in the context of neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and addiction. Therefore, it can be considered a \"Disease\" entity in this context."},
