GDNF (Glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor)\n3. c-Ret (Tyrosine kinase receptor)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. PCE is a potential disease because it is mentioned as a factor that inhibits the expression of the AT2R gene and protein in fetal kidneys.\n2. GDNF is a gene that is involved in the signaling pathway that is repressed by PCE. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n3. c-Ret is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is part of the GDNF signaling pathway. Since the expression of this pathway is repressed by PCE, it can also be considered a disease entity in this context."},
