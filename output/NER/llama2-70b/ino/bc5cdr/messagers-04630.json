Hyperprolactinemia is a condition where there is an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood. It is a hormonal disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and infertility.\n2. ME (Microenvironment) refers to the environment in which cells or tissues are placed in a culture or in vivo. In this context, it is likely that ME refers to a specific type of cell culture or tissue culture.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Hyperprolactinemia and ME."},
