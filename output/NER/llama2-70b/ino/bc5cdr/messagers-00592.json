Chloride (Cl-) - a negatively charged ion that plays a crucial role in the functioning of the skeletal muscle chloride channel.\n2. Chloride channel - a protein that regulates the flow of chloride ions across the cell membrane.\n3. Skeletal muscle - a type of muscle tissue that is responsible for voluntary movement.\n4. Membrane - a thin layer of lipid and protein molecules that surrounds a cell and regulates the flow of ions and molecules in and out of the cell.\n5. Depolarization - a process in which the membrane potential of a cell becomes less negative, which can lead to the activation of various cellular processes.\n\nI hope this helps!
