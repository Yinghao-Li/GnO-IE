Subependymal cyst formation is a condition where cysts form in the subependymal region of the brain. It is a disease entity because it is an abnormality in the brain that can cause harm or disrupt normal brain function.\n2. Cocaine prenatal exposure is a disease entity because it is a harmful exposure that can affect the development of the fetus and increase the risk of various health problems, including subependymal cyst formation."},
