Current psychotic symptoms\n\nThe term \"psychotic symptoms\" is still relevant because it refers to a set of symptoms that are characteristic of psychotic disorders, which are a group of mental health conditions that can cause a person to lose touch with reality. \"Current psychotic symptoms\" is also relevant because it specifically refers to the presence of these symptoms in the present time, indicating that the individual is currently experiencing a psychotic episode.\n\nI hope this revised list is helpful!
