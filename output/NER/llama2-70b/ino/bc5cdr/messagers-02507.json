Methamphetamine (METH) - This is a drug that can cause negative effects on the body and mind, and can lead to addiction.\n2. Monoaminergic system disruption - This refers to the disruption of the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, which can lead to various negative effects on mood and cognitive function.\n3. Depressive symptoms - This refers to symptoms of depression, which can include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities.\n4. Drug withdrawal - This refers to the physical and psychological symptoms that can occur when an individual stops using a drug to which they have become addicted.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Methamphetamine (METH)\n* Monoaminergic system disruption\n* Depressive symptoms\n* Drug withdrawal"},
