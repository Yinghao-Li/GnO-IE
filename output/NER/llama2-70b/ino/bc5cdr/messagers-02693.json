Systemic vascular resistance\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Antagonists are chemical substances that bind to receptors and prevent the action of another substance, in this case, they prevent the fall in systemic vascular resistance.\n2. Systemic vascular resistance is a measure of the resistance to blood flow in the systemic circulation, and it is a physiological parameter that can be influenced by various chemical substances, including drugs and hormones.\n\nTherefore, both antagonists and systemic vascular resistance can be considered chemical entities in the context of the given paragraph."},
