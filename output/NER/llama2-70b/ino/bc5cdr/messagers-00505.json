Blood and brain are both composed of various chemical compounds, such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and neurotransmitters. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a specialized structure that separates the brain from the bloodstream and is composed of various chemical components, including proteins and lipids."},

Brain\n\nThe term \"barrier\" is not a chemical entity, so it can be removed from the list. The phrase \"blood-brain barrier\" (BBB) is a term used to describe a specialized structure in the body, but it does not refer to a specific chemical compound, so it can also be removed from the list.\n\nThe remaining entities, \"blood\" and \"brain,\" are both chemical entities because they are composed of various chemical compounds."},
