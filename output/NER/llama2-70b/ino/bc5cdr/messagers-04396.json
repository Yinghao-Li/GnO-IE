Syndrome: A syndrome is a set of symptoms that occur together and are associated with a particular disease or condition. In this paragraph, the syndrome is not explicitly named, but it is mentioned as a condition that developed in four of the ten patients who were infused with Ara-C.\n2. IL-1, IL-2, TNF, and PAF: These are all biological molecules that are involved in the immune response. They are being measured in the patients' bodies as part of the biological assays performed during the Ara-C infusion.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the syndrome that developed in the patients, as well as the biological molecules that are being measured as part of the assays."},
