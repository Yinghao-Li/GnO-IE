    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the entities related to diseases are:\n\n1. Mutation: The paragraph mentions a specific mutation, p.Val204Asp, which is a genetic alteration that can potentially lead to disease.\n2. Disruption of hydrogen bonding: The mutation disrupts the hydrogen bonding between Gln223 and Glu441, which can affect the structure and function of the protein.\n3. Disruption of the catalytic triad functionality: The disruption of the hydrogen bonding leads to the movement of Ser198 and His438 away from each other, which can disrupt the functionality of the catalytic triad, potentially leading to disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mutation (p.Val204Asp)\n2. Disruption of hydrogen bonding\n3. Disruption of the catalytic triad functionality"},
