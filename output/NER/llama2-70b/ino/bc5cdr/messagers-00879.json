Hemoglobin (Hb) - Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. It is a chemical compound made up of four subunits: two alpha subunits and two beta subunits.\n2. Anemia - Anemia is a medical condition where the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells or a lower than normal amount of hemoglobin in the blood. Anemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency, chronic diseases, and blood loss.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
