    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. Taqman assays - Taqman is a brand name for a type of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that uses a specific type of DNA probe called a Taqman probe. The probe is designed to bind to a specific DNA sequence and emit a fluorescent signal that can be detected and quantified.\n2. Allelic discrimination - This refers to the process of distinguishing between different alleles (versions) of a gene. In the context of the paragraph, allelic discrimination is used to determine which version of the gene (rs4704559, rs10942891, or rs4704560) is present in each patient's DNA.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Taqman assays\n* Taqman probes\n* DNA\n* Alleles (rs4704559, rs10942891, and rs4704560)"},
