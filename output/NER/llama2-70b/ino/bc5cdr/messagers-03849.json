PAN glomeruli refers to a type of glomerulopathy, a disease that affects the glomeruli, which are tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.\n2. Mesangial areas with dysfunction refer to the areas within the glomeruli where the mesangial cells, which provide support and structure to the glomeruli, are not functioning properly. This dysfunction can lead to various kidney diseases and disorders."},
