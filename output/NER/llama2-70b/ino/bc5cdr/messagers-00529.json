To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph, we need to look for words or phrases that refer to medical conditions or disorders.\n\nHere are the possible \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. \"cocaine-induced locomotor activity\" - This phrase refers to the increased movement and activity that occurs in response to cocaine use, which can be a sign of drug addiction or drug-induced hyperactivity.\n2. \"adenosine receptor agonists\" - These are drugs that activate adenosine receptors, which are involved in various physiological processes, including regulation of the immune system, inflammation, and neurotransmission.\n3. \"A2A receptor agonist\" - This refers to a type of adenosine receptor agonist that specifically activates the A2A receptor, which is involved in regulating the immune response and inflammation.\n4. \"A1 receptor agonist\" - This refers to a type of adenosine receptor agonist that specifically activates the A1 receptor, which is involved in regulating the immune response and neurotransmission.\n5. \"A2/A1 receptor agonist\" - This refers to a drug that activates both the A2 and A1 receptors, which can have a combined effect on the immune response and neurotransmission.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cocaine-induced locomotor activity\n* Adenosine receptor agonists\n* A2A receptor agonist\n* A1 receptor agonist\n* A2/A1 receptor agonist"},
