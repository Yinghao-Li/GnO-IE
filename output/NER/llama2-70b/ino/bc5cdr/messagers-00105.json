Anorexigen refers to a class of drugs that stimulate the central nervous system and suppress appetite, leading to weight loss. It is a chemical substance that can be synthesized or derived from natural sources.\n2. Pulmonary hypertension is a medical condition characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, which can lead to heart failure and death. While it is not a chemical entity in itself, it is mentioned in the context of the paragraph as a potential side effect of anorexigen use.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Anorexigen and Pulmonary hypertension."},
