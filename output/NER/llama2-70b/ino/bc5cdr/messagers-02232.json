Temsirolimus is a chemical entity because it is a drug that is used to treat cancer. It is a targeted therapy that inhibits the mTOR pathway and has cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects.\n2. Conventional chemotherapy refers to traditional cancer treatments that use drugs to kill cancer cells. It is a broader term that encompasses a range of chemical entities, including alkylating agents, antimetabolites, antitumor antibiotics, and plant alkaloids.\n\nI hope this helps!
