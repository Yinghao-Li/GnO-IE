Catalepsy - Catalepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by a trance-like state, immobility, and resistance to external stimuli.\n2. Haloperidol - Haloperidol is a drug used to treat various psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, but it can also induce catalepsy as a side effect.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Catalepsy\n* Haloperidol-induced catalepsy"},
