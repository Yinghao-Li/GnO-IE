It is considered a disease entity because it is a abnormal condition that can cause neurological symptoms and impair cognitive function.\n* BCNU-exposed cortical dysplasia group is a disease entity because it is a group of individuals who have been exposed to a chemical substance (BCNU) and have developed cortical dysplasia as a result. This group is distinct from the control group, which did not have exposure to BCNU and did not develop cortical dysplasia."},
