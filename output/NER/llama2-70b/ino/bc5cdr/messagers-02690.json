H1 - histamine antagonists: These are drugs that block the action of histamine, a chemical messenger involved in allergic reactions and other physiological processes.\n2. H2 - histamine antagonists: These are also drugs that block the action of histamine, but they work on a different receptor (H2) than H1 antagonists.\n3. d-tubocurarine: This is a drug that blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in muscle contraction and other physiological processes.\n4. cimetidine: This is a drug that blocks the action of histamine on H2 receptors and is used to treat conditions such as gastric ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n5. chlorpheniramine: This is a drug that blocks the action of histamine on H1 receptors and is used to treat conditions such as allergies, hay fever, and hives.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Gastric ulcers\n* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n* Allergies\n* Hay fever\n* Hives"},

Histamine antagonists: This term refers to a class of drugs that block the action of histamine, a chemical messenger in the body. The paragraph doesn't specify which histamine antagonists were used, so we can't identify them as specific chemical entities.\n2. Placebo: A placebo is an inactive substance used as a control in medical experiments. It's not a chemical entity, but rather a term used to describe a lack of active treatment.\n3. d-tubocurarine: This is a chemical entity, specifically a drug used as a muscle relaxant.\n4. Cimetidine: This is a chemical entity, specifically a drug used to treat ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n5.
