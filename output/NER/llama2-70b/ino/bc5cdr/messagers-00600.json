Respiratory pattern\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, and it is considered a disease.\n* Respiratory pattern refers to the way a person or animal breathes, and in this context, it is being studied in a rat model of epilepsy, which means that the rats are being used to model the disease epilepsy for research purposes. Therefore, respiratory pattern is also a disease entity in this context."},
