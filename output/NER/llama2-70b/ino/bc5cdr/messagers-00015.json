Identify the keywords that indicate the presence of a disease or medical condition:\n * Azotemia\n * Bacterial infections\n * Dehydration\n2. Identify the entities that are associated with these keywords:\n * Azotemia: 26 episodes\n * Bacterial infections: 18 episodes\n * Dehydration: 14 episodes\n3. Determine whether these entities are diseases or medical conditions:\n * Yes, all three entities are diseases or medical conditions.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Azotemia\n2. Bacterial infections\n3. Dehydration"},
