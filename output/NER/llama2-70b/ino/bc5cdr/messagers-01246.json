Stroke is a disease that affects the brain and is characterized by a sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain, leading to brain cell death.\n2. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motivation, pleasure, and reward processing in the brain. While dopamine itself is not a disease, abnormalities in dopamine signaling have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, addiction, and schizophrenia. In the context of the paragraph, dopamine is mentioned as a factor that enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients."},
