Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\n\nThese three entities are all related to the medical condition or disease that is being described in the paragraph. Angio-oedema is a condition characterized by swelling of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, which is caused by the accumulation of fluid. Long-term therapy refers to the prolonged use of a medication or treatment, in this case, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. An ACE inhibitor is a medication that is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Angio-oedema\n* Long-term therapy\n* Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor"},

Therefore, they are not included in the list of disease entities."},
