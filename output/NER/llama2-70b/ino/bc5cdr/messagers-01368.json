Potassium is a chemical element with the symbol K and atomic number 19. It is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including muscle contractions, heart function, and nerve function.\n2. Potassium level refers to the concentration of potassium ions (K+) in the blood. In this paragraph, the potassium level is mentioned as 3.34 meq/L, which is a measure of the amount of potassium present in the blood serum. Meq/L is an abbreviation for milliequivalents per liter, which is a unit of measurement for the concentration of ions in a solution."},
