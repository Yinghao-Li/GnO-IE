Creatinine is a chemical compound that is produced by the metabolism of creatine in the body. It is a waste product that is normally removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in the urine.\n2. Serum creatinine is the level of creatinine in the blood. It is a measure of how well the kidneys are functioning, and it is often used to diagnose and monitor kidney disease. In this paragraph, the serum creatinine level is mentioned as 1.9 mg/dL, which is an increase from the previous day's level of 1.2 mg/dL and the level on admission, which was 0.8 mg/dL."},
