Coronary artery bypass grafting: This is a surgical procedure used to treat coronary artery disease.\n2. Myocardial infarction: This is a medical term for a heart attack, which is a disease that occurs when the blood flow to the heart is blocked.\n3. Hyperkalemia: This is a condition where there is an abnormally high level of potassium in the blood, which can be caused by various factors, including kidney disease, certain medications, and potassium supplements.\n4. Bradycardia: This is a condition where the heart rate is abnormally slow, which can be caused by various factors, including medication side effects, heart disease, and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Coronary artery disease\n2. Myocardial infarction\n3. Hyperkalemia\n4. Bradycardia"},

Hyperkalemia (high level of potassium in the blood)\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as coronary artery bypass grafting and bradycardia, are not directly referring to diseases, but rather to medical procedures and symptoms that can be related to diseases.

Myocardial infarction - this is a medical term for a heart attack, which occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle.\n4. Bradycardia - this is a condition where the heart rate is abnormally slow, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including hyperkalemia.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Potassium (K+)\n* Coronary artery bypass grafting\n* Myocardial infarction\n* Bradycardia"},
