In this context, the term \"aberrant\" suggests that the cardiomyocytes are not functioning or structured normally, which could be indicative of a disease or condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are the abnormal cardiomyocytes that are being studied in the research."},
