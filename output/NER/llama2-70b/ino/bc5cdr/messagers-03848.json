PAN (Pancreatic amylase nitrogen) is a chemical compound that is produced by the pancreas and is involved in the digestion of carbohydrates.\n3. Mesangium is a chemical structure in the kidney that is involved in the filtration of blood.\n4. Sclerosis is a chemical process that refers to the hardening or thickening of tissues, which can occur due to various chemical changes in the body.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the given paragraph are CC, PAN, mesangium, and sclerosis."},
