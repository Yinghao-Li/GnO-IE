The paragraph discusses the effects of suxamethonium on healthy children, and therefore, there is no mention of any disease or medical condition.\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"muscle fasciculations\" caused by suxamethonium, but fasciculations are not typically considered a disease entity. They are a symptom or a physiological response that can occur in various conditions, including neurological disorders, but they can also occur in healthy individuals, as in the case of the children studied in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nNo disease entities are mentioned in the paragraph."},
