Nifedipine (a medication used to treat certain heart conditions)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Atrial flutter is a type of cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, that affects the atria. It is a disease of the heart's electrical system.\n* Ventricular rate refers to the number of times the ventricles of the heart contract per minute. In this paragraph, the ventricular rate is mentioned as 70/min, which is a normal range for adults.\n* Nifedipine is a medication used to treat certain heart conditions, such as angina, high blood pressure, and some types of arrhythmias. It is not a disease entity in itself, but it is mentioned in the context of treating a heart condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Atrial flutter and Ventricular rate."},

Atrial flutter\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Atrial flutter is a type of cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, that affects the atria. It is a disease of the heart's electrical system.\n\nThe ventricular rate and nifedipine are not diseases, but rather a physiological response and a medication used to treat certain heart conditions, respectively. Therefore, they are not relevant to the \"Disease\" category."},
