Acute renal failure is a disease entity because it is a sudden and severe loss of kidney function that can be caused by various factors, including medication side effects, such as high-dose methotrexate therapy.\n2. Ileostomy is a disease entity because it is a surgically created opening in the small intestine that can be caused by various conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, or trauma.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Acute renal failure and Ileostomy."},
