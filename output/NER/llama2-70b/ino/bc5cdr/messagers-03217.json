Kidney lesions are a disease entity as they are abnormalities in the kidney tissue that can be indicative of various kidney diseases.\n2. TGF-b, NF-kb, mTOR, PCNA, TP53, KIM-1, and CTGF are all proteins or genes that are associated with various diseases, including cancer and kidney disease.\n3. The paragraph suggests that short CsA treatment may result in slight or absent kidney lesions, indicating that these proteins and genes may be involved in the development or progression of kidney disease.\n4. Therefore, all of these entities can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},

NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) - a protein complex that regulates gene expression and inflammation.\n4. mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) - a protein that regulates cell growth and metabolism.\n5.

TP53 (tumor protein p53) - a protein that regulates cell growth, DNA repair, and apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n7.
