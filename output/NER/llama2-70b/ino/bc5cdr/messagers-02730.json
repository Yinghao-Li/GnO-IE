Neuroradiologic central nervous system late effects\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is a disease that is being treated in the context of the paragraph.\n* Neurocognitive late effects and neuroradiologic central nervous system late effects are both conditions that can occur as a result of treatment for ALL. They are therefore also considered diseases in this context.\n* Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat ALL, and the paragraph suggests that it may be a contributing factor to the development of neurocognitive and neuroradiologic late effects. However, methotrexate is not a disease entity in this context, but rather a treatment that may have unintended consequences."},
