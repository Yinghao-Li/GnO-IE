L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Dopaminergic lesion: A lesion is a damage or abnormality in a biological tissue or organ. In this context, a dopaminergic lesion refers to damage to the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, which can lead to various neurological disorders.\n2. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias: Dyskinesias are involuntary, abnormal movements that can be caused by certain medications, including L-DOPA, which is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias are therefore a type of drug-induced disease."},

Dopaminergic lesion\n\nThe entity \"L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias\" is not a disease in itself, but rather a side effect or complication of a medication (L-DOPA) used to treat a disease (Parkinson's disease). Therefore, it is not included in the list of diseases."},
