Bile-diverted rats - Bile diversion is a surgical procedure that diverts bile from the liver to the small intestine. This procedure is often used to study the effects of bile acid malabsorption, which can be associated with certain diseases such as bile acid malabsorption syndrome or Crohn's disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are:\n\n1.
