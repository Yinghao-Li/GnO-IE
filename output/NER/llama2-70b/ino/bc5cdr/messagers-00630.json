Normal control subjects\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Acute liver failure is a medical condition where the liver suddenly stops functioning properly, leading to various complications such as liver damage, inflammation, and failure of other organs. It is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.\n* Normal control subjects refer to individuals who do not have any underlying medical conditions, specifically acute liver failure, and are used as a reference point for comparison in medical studies. In this paragraph, they are used as a control group to compare the serum levels of sFas (soluble Fas) with those of patients with acute liver failure."},
