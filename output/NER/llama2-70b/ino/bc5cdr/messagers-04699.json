Intrathecal methotrexate\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Paraplegia is a disease characterized by paralysis of the lower half of the body, typically caused by damage to the spinal cord or nervous system.\n2. Methotrexate is a drug that is sometimes used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory diseases. However, it can also cause side effects, including paraplegia, when administered intrathecally (into the spinal fluid).\n3. Intrathecal methotrexate refers to the administration of methotrexate into the spinal fluid, which can cause paraplegia as a side effect.\n\nTherefore, all three entities can be classified as \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},

Paraplegia is a disease characterized by paralysis of the lower half of the body, typically caused by damage to the spinal cord or nervous system.\n\nThe other two entities, \"Methotrexate\" and \"Intrathecal methotrexate,\" are not directly referring to a disease, but rather a drug and its method of administration, respectively. While they may be related to the development of paraplegia in some cases, they are not directly diseases themselves. Therefore, the only entity that clearly refers to a disease in the given paragraph is \"Paraplegia.\""},
