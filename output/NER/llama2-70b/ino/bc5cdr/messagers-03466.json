It is a disease entity because it is a pathological condition that can cause symptoms and potentially lead to serious complications.\n* Ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia is a specific type of ventricular tachycardia that is caused by the administration of the drug ouabain. It is also a disease entity because it is a pathological condition that can cause symptoms and potentially lead to serious complications."},
