Cocaine-associated chest pain is a medical condition that occurs as a result of using cocaine and is characterized by chest pain or discomfort. It is considered a disease entity because it is a health problem that requires medical attention.\n2. Troponin I is a protein that is released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged. It is used as a diagnostic marker to detect heart muscle damage and is often elevated in patients with acute coronary syndrome. In the context of the paragraph, troponin I is being discussed as a tool for diagnosing and managing cocaine-associated chest pain. Therefore, it is also a disease entity in this context."},
