Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland and play a crucial role in the body's response to stress. They are chemical messengers that help regulate various physiological processes, including metabolism, immune response, and inflammation.\n2. ER stress (endoplasmic reticulum stress) refers to the stress or pressure that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when it is unable to properly fold and process proteins. This can lead to the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can have both short-term and long-term effects on the cell.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
