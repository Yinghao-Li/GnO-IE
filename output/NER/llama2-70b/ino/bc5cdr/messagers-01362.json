Blood pressure: Blood pressure is a measure of the force exerted by blood on the walls of blood vessels. It is expressed in units of millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Therefore, \"120/80 mmHg\" can be considered a chemical entity as it represents a quantity of a physical parameter that is measured in chemical units.\n2. Pulse rate: Pulse rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. It is a physiological parameter that can be measured using chemical means, such as electrocardiography (ECG). Therefore, \"100 x/minute\" can be considered a chemical entity as it represents a quantity of a physiological parameter that can be measured using chemical means.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
