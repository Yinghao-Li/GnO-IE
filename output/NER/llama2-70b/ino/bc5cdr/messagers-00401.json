Chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis is a disease caused by the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside, a drug that can cause damage to the kidneys.\n2. Glomerular injury refers to damage to the glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. This can be a symptom of various kidney diseases, including chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis."},
