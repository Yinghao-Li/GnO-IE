Cardiac myocytes - This refers to cells in the heart muscle that are responsible for contraction and relaxation of the heart.\n2. Mitochondrial respiration - This refers to the process by which cells produce energy in the form of ATP through the breakdown of glucose and other organic molecules using oxygen.\n3. Cellular vacuolization - This refers to the formation of vacuoles or small sacs within cells, which can be a sign of cellular stress or disease.\n4. Doxorubicin - This is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cardiac myocytes\n* Mitochondrial respiration\n* Cellular vacuolization\n* Doxorubicin (as a drug that can cause cellular stress and disorder)"},
