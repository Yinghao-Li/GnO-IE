Molecular alterations\n\nIn this context, \"early-life exposure\" refers to the exposure of animals or humans to chemical substances or pollutants during their early stages of life, such as during fetal development or childhood. \"Molecular alterations\" refer to changes at the molecular level, such as changes in DNA, RNA, proteins, or metabolites, that can be caused by exposure to chemical substances.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Chemical substances or pollutants that can cause early-life exposure\n2. Chemical substances or pollutants that can cause molecular alterations\n\nI hope this helps!
