The surgical procedure (Mitral Annulus Plasty or MAP) and the use of prosthetic bands and mattress sutures are medical interventions, but they are not diseases. Therefore, the table above shows that no disease entities are mentioned in the paragraph."}

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Prosthetic band\n2. Mattress sutures\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Prosthetic band: A prosthetic band is a synthetic or artificial material used to replace or support a natural structure, in this case, the posterior mitral annulus. It is made of chemical materials such as polymers, metals, or ceramics.\n2. Mattress sutures: Mattress sutures are used to close wounds or incisions in surgical procedures. They are made of chemical materials such as polyester, polyglycolic acid, or polydioxanone, which are biocompatible and can be absorbed by the body over time.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are the prosthetic band and mattress sutures, both of which are made of chemical materials."},
