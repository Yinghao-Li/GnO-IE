Terfenadine\n\nThese are the two drugs mentioned in the paragraph that are known to prolong the QTc interval, which is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. Prolongation of the QTc interval can increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes, which can be fatal. Therefore, Amiodarone and Terfenadine are relevant \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
