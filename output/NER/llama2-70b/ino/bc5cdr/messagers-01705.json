Hump-like deposits\n\nThese are all signs of disease in the kidneys, specifically glomerular disease. The presence of membrane spikes, swelling of podocytes, and subepithelial deposits are all indicative of glomerular damage or disease. The hump-like deposits are likely referring to large subepithelial deposits that have formed in the glomeruli, which can be a sign of certain kidney diseases such as membranous nephropathy."},

The presence of membrane spikes and subepithelial deposits are both signs of glomerular damage or disease, while the swelling of podocytes is a common feature of various glomerular diseases."},
