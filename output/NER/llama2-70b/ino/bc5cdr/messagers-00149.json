Sulfadiazine is a chemical compound used in the treatment of bacterial infections.\n2. Water is a chemical compound that is essential for human health and is involved in many physiological processes, including the excretion of waste products through urination.\n3. Alcalinization (alkalization) refers to the process of increasing the pH of a solution or substance, which can be achieved through the addition of a base or by other means. In the context of the paragraph, alcalinization of the urine is mentioned as a possible step in the treatment with sulfadiazine."},
