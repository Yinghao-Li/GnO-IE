Tumor: A tumor is an abnormal growth of cells that can be benign or malignant. In this paragraph, the tumor is induced by estrogen.\n2. Hemorrhagic phenotypes: Hemorrhagic phenotypes refer to the symptoms or characteristics of a disease that are related to bleeding or hemorrhage. In this paragraph, the hemorrhagic phenotypes are associated with the tumor.\n3. Estrogen-induced tumor: This is a type of tumor that is caused by the hormone estrogen. It is a disease entity because it is a condition that affects the body and can cause symptoms."},
