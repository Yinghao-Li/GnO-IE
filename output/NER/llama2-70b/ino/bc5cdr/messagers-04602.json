Overall response rate\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Complete responses and partial responses are both measures of the effectiveness of a treatment in combating a disease. They indicate the extent to which the disease has responded to the treatment.\n* Overall response rate is a measure that combines complete and partial responses to give a comprehensive picture of the treatment's effectiveness in addressing the disease.\n\nTherefore, all three entities are related to the disease being treated and are relevant to the effectiveness of the treatment."},
