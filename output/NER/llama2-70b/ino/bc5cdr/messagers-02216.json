EndoMT (Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition) - a process that occurs in response to various stimuli, including injury, inflammation, or exposure to toxic substances, and is associated with various diseases, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and fibrosis.\n2. Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) - substances that form when proteins or lipids react with sugars, leading to the accumulation of cross-linked, oxidized, and fluorescent compounds, which are known to play a role in the development and progression of various diseases, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease.\n3. Atherosclerosis - a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the arterial wall and is characterized by the accumulation of lipids, inflammatory cells, and fibrous tissue, leading to the formation of plaques that can obstruct blood flow and cause cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* EndoMT\n* Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs)\n* Atherosclerosis"},
