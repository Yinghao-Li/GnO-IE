To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we need to look for any mentions of medical conditions or disorders.\n\n1. \"cocaine\" - Cocaine is a drug that can cause physical and psychological dependence, and long-term use can lead to various health problems, including cardiovascular issues, respiratory problems, and neurological damage. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity.\n2. \"ethanol\" - Ethanol, also known as alcohol, is a psychoactive substance that can cause dependence and various health problems, including liver damage, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. Therefore, it can also be considered a disease entity.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cocaine\n2. Ethanol"},
