Citrate is a chemical compound that is used in medical procedures to prevent blood clotting.\n2. Anticoagulation is a chemical process that prevents the formation of blood clots. It is achieved through the use of anticoagulant drugs or agents that inhibit the production of clotting factors.\n\nTherefore, both citrate and anticoagulation are chemical entities in the given paragraph."},
