Pollutants - This is a general term that refers to chemical substances that are present in the environment and can have harmful effects on human health or the environment.\n2.

Dopamine - Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motor control, reward, and other physiological processes. It is produced and released by dopaminergic neurons.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Pollutants\n* Dopaminergic neurons\n* Dopamine"},
