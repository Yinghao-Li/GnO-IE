Renin-angiotensin system\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Type 1 diabetes is a disease characterized by the body's inability to produce enough insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels.\n2. Nephropathy, also known as kidney disease, is a complication of diabetes that affects the kidneys and can lead to kidney failure. Early diabetic nephropathy refers to the early stages of this disease.\n3. Normoalbuminuria is a condition where the level of albumin in the urine is normal, which is used as a marker for kidney damage in diabetes.\n4. The renin-angiotensin system is a physiological system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. Blockade of this system is a potential treatment for diabetic nephropathy.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the conditions and systems that are directly related to the study's objective, which is to investigate the progression of early diabetic nephropathy and the potential role of the renin-angiotensin system in its pathogenesis."},

Renin and angiotensin are both proteins that are involved in the renin-angiotensin system, which is a hormonal system that regulates blood pressure and electrolyte balance.\n2. Albumin is a protein found in blood plasma that plays a role in maintaining fluid balance and transporting various molecules throughout the body.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are renin, angiotensin, and albumin."},
