Sotalol\n2. d,l-sotalol (this is a mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers of sotalol)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Sotalol is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat certain heart rhythm disorders. It is a beta blocker that is used to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.\n* d,l-sotalol is a mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers of sotalol. Enantiomers are molecules that have the same chemical formula but differ in their spatial arrangement of atoms. In this case, the R-enantiomer and S-enantiomer of sotalol have the same chemical formula (C12H16N2O4) but differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space. The d,l-notation indicates that the mixture contains equal amounts of both enantiomers."},
