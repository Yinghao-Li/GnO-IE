They are not diseases themselves, but rather medications used to treat diseases. Therefore, they are not considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph.\n\nThe paragraph describes the dosages of carboplatin and paclitaxel used in patient cohorts, indicating that these drugs are being used to treat some kind of disease or condition.
