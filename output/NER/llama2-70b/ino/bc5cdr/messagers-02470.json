Everolimus is a chemical compound that is used as an immunosuppressant drug to prevent rejection in organ transplant patients. It is a synthetic derivative of the fungal metabolite rapamycin.\n2. AL amyloidosis is a type of amyloidosis, a group of diseases characterized by the accumulation of insoluble, fibrous protein aggregates known as amyloid fibers. In this case, the amyloid fibers are composed of the protein AL (amyloid light chain)."},
