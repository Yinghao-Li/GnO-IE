Acute myocardial ischemic injury is a disease entity as it is a condition that results in a sudden reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to tissue damage or necrosis.\n2. Isoproterenol is a disease entity as it is a drug that can cause a sudden increase in heart rate and blood pressure, which can lead to acute myocardial ischemic injury.\n\nTherefore, both Acute myocardial ischemic injury and Isoproterenol are disease entities in the paragraph."},

Acute myocardial ischemic injury is a disease entity as it is a condition that results in a sudden reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to tissue damage or necrosis.\n\nIsoproterenol, which was mentioned in the original list, is not a disease entity in this context as it is a drug that can cause a sudden increase in heart rate and blood pressure, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, the updated list only includes Acute myocardial ischemic injury as a disease entity."},
