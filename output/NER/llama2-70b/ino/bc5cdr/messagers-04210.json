Dystonic dyskinesias are typically associated with dystonia, a neurological disorder that causes muscle contractions that can result in abnormal postures or movements. Choreic dyskinesias, on the other hand, are associated with chorea, a type of movement disorder characterized by rapid, jerky movements that can affect the arms, legs, or face.\n\nI hope this helps!
