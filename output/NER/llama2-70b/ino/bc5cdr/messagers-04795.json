Identify the adverse events mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n* Increase in blood urea nitrogen levels\n* Development of gingival hyperplasia\n2. Determine whether each adverse event can be considered a disease.\n\na. Increase in blood urea nitrogen levels: Yes, this can be considered a disease or a medical condition, specifically a side effect of the medication.\n\nb. Development of gingival hyperplasia: Yes, this can also be considered a disease or a medical condition, specifically a side effect of the medication.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
