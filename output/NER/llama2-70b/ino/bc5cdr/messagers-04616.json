Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * follow-up\n * patients\n * nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence\n * sudden death\n2. Determine which entities are diseases:\n * Nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence and sudden death are both diseases.\n3. Remove any entities that are not diseases:\n * Follow-up is not a disease, it's a medical procedure or process.\n * Patients are not diseases, they are individuals who have diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence\n2. Sudden death"},
