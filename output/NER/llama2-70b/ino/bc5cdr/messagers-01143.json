It is an indication that the treatment is working, but more work needs to be done to achieve a complete response.\n* S-1 treatment is a therapy or medication that is being used to treat the patient's disease. It is a disease-modifying agent that aims to alter the course of the disease.\n\nTherefore, both partial response and S-1 treatment are related to the disease that the patient is suffering from, and can be considered \"Disease\" entities."},
