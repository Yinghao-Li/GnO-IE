Radiotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells. It is a chemical entity because it involves the use of ionizing radiation, which is a chemical agent that can interact with biological molecules and cause damage to cancer cells.\n2. Topotecan is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat various types of cancer, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It is a chemical entity because it is a synthetic compound that is designed to interact with specific biological molecules and inhibit the growth of cancer cells.\n\nI hope this helps!
