Morbidity\n\nThese three entities can be classified as \"Disease\" because they are all related to health problems or medical conditions. Chronic heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs. Mortality refers to death, and morbidity refers to having a disease or medical condition, especially one that is chronic or serious.\n\nI hope this helps!

Chronic heart failure (CHF)\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as mortality and morbidity, are not specific diseases, but rather general health outcomes or conditions that can be influenced by various factors, including disease. Therefore, they are not directly relevant to the \"Disease\" entity category.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
