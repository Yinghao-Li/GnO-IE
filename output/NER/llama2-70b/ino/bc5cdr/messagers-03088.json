Non-transgenic (NON-TXG) littermates\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph describes a study in which mice were injected with DOX for 5 weeks. The mice used in the study were MHC-CB7 mice, which express dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes, and their non-transgenic littermates. Therefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. MHC-CB7 mice, which have a genetic modification that causes them to express dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes.\n2. Non-transgenic (NON-TXG) littermates, which do not have the genetic modification and serve as a control group for comparison."},
