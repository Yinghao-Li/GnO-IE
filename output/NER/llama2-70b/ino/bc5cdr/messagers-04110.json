Bepridil is a drug that is being tested in vitro on isolated sino-atrial tissue from rabbit hearts. It is not a disease entity in itself, but it is being used to investigate its effects on the tissue.\n2. Sino-atrial tissue is a type of tissue from the heart that is being studied in vitro. It is not a disease entity, but rather a normal tissue that is being used to understand the effects of bepridil.\n3. Rabbit heart is the source of the sino-atrial tissue being studied. It is not a disease entity, but rather a normal heart tissue that is being used as a model to study the effects of bepridil.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
