Hypoparathyroidism is a disease characterized by a deficiency of parathyroid hormone, which leads to hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) and hyperphosphatemia (elevated phosphate levels).\n2. Milk-alkali syndrome is a disease caused by excessive intake of calcium and alkali substances (such as antacids), which can lead to metabolic alkalosis, hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels), and kidney damage.\n\nIn the paragraph, the patient was treated with calcium carbonate and calcitriol for hypoparathyroidism, but this treatment resulted in two admissions to the hospital for milk-alkali syndrome. Therefore, both hypoparathyroidism and milk-alkali syndrome are \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},
