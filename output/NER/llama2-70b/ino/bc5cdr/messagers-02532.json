Treatment groups: The paragraph mentions \"three treatment groups\" without specifying what they are. Since the context is mortality, it can be inferred that the treatment groups are likely to be different chemical compounds or drugs being tested for their effect on mortality.\n2. Control: The paragraph also mentions a \"control\" group, which is a standard against which the treatment groups are compared. The control group likely consists of a placebo or a standard treatment that is already established and widely used.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the treatment groups and the control."},
