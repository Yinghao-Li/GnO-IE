Proarrhythmia refers to an abnormal heart rhythm, which is a disease or condition that affects the normal functioning of the heart.\n2. Amiodarone-induced proarrhythmia is a specific type of proarrhythmia that is caused by the drug amiodarone.

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. Amiodarone\n\nAmiodarone is a chemical compound that is used as a drug to treat various types of arrhythmias. It is a class III antiarrhythmic drug, which means it works by blocking the potassium channels in the heart and increasing the duration of the action potential.\n\n2. Proarrhythmia\n\nProarrhythmia is a chemical entity in the sense that it is a term used to describe a change in the heart's rhythm caused by a drug or other substance. In this case, the proarrhythmia is caused by amiodarone therapy.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Amiodarone\n2. Proarrhythmia (as a chemical entity, not a clinical condition)"},
