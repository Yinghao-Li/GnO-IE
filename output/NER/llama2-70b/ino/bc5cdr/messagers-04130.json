Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to the presence of foreign substances (antigens) in the body. They are made up of various chemical compounds such as amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.\n2. IgM is a type of antibody that is produced in the early stages of an immune response. It is a large antibody molecule that can activate complement and trigger other immune responses. IgM is composed of a combination of chemical compounds, including proteins and carbohydrates.\n\nTherefore, both \"antibodies\" and \"IgM class\" can be considered \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph."},
