Cardiac toxicity refers to the harmful effects of a substance on the heart, which can lead to various cardiovascular diseases.\n2. Cocaethylene (CE) is a metabolite of cocaine that is formed when cocaine is combined with ethanol. It can cause harmful effects on the body, particularly the cardiovascular system.\n3. Cocaine metabolite refers to the breakdown products of cocaine in the body, which can also have harmful effects on the body.\n\nTherefore, all three entities can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},
