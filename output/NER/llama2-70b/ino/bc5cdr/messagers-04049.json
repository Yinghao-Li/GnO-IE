Higher cumulative dose refers to a larger amount of a drug or substance that has been administered over a period of time, which can have an effect on the body.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the heart muscle, a radioactive substance used to image the heart muscle, and a higher dose of a drug or substance that can affect the body."},
