Hyperlipidemia (high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood)\n\nThe mention of \"niacin extended-release/lovastatin\" implies that the patients in question have hyperlipidemia, which is a disease characterized by high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Therefore, this entity is relevant to the disease category.\n\nThe other two entities, \"liver enzymes\" and \"muscle enzymes,\" are not directly related to the disease category, and their mention in the paragraph is related to the safety and side effects of the drug combination, rather than the disease itself.\n\nI hope this revised list is helpful.
