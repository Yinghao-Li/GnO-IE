Albumin is a protein found in blood plasma that plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid balance and transporting various molecules throughout the body.\n2. Serum albumin is the concentration of albumin in the blood serum.\n3. Ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, which can be caused by various factors, including nephrotic syndrome, liver disease, and heart failure.\n4. Hydrothorax is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity, which can be caused by various factors, including heart failure, lung disease, and pleural injury.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are albumin, serum albumin, ascites, and hydrothorax."},
