Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)\n\nThe term \"cerebral microbleeds\" (MB) refers to a condition where small blood vessels in the brain experience bleeding, which can potentially lead to a more severe condition like intracerebral hemorrhage. Therefore, it is not a disease entity in this context, but rather a precursor or risk factor for a disease."},
