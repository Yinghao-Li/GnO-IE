Control dogs\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this paragraph, \"doxorubicin - treated dogs\" are dogs that have been treated with the drug doxorubicin, which is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer. \"Control dogs\" are dogs that have not been treated with doxorubicin and are used as a comparison group to assess the effects of the drug.\n\nTherefore, both \"doxorubicin - treated dogs\" and \"control dogs\" can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph, as they represent two different states of health: diseased (doxorubicin - treated dogs) and healthy (control dogs)."},
