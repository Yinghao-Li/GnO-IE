Identify the main entities in the paragraph:\n * Isoniazid\n * L-glutamic acid decarboxylase\n * Pilocarpine\n * Seizures\n * Status epilepticus\n2. Determine which of these entities are related to disease:\n * Isoniazid: Yes, it is a medication used to treat tuberculosis.\n * L-glutamic acid decarboxylase: No, it is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of GABA, a neurotransmitter.\n * Pilocarpine: Yes, it is a medication used to treat various eye disorders, and it can also cause seizures at high doses.\n * Seizures: Yes, they are a symptom of various neurological disorders.\n * Status epilepticus: Yes, it is a condition characterized by prolonged seizures or recurrent seizures without a return to normal consciousness.\n3. Identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph:\n * Tuberculosis (related to isoniazid)\n * Seizures (related to pilocarpine and status epilepticus)\n * Status epilepticus\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Tuberculosis\n2. Seizures\n3. Status epilepticus"},
