Recurrent squamous cell carcinoma\n\nThe paragraph is specifically discussing a clinical trial for patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, which is a type of cancer. Therefore, both \"squamous cell carcinoma\" and \"recurrent squamous cell carcinoma\" can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this context."},

Recurrent squamous cell carcinoma\n\nThe term \"squamous cell carcinoma\" is a type of cancer, and \"recurrent\" modifies the cancer, indicating that it has returned after previous treatment. Therefore, \"recurrent squamous cell carcinoma\" clearly refers to a disease entity."},
