Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is the effect of melatonin on the cerebellar cortex in a rat model of cortical dysplasia.\n2. Identify the key words related to disease: The key words related to disease in the paragraph are \"cortical dysplasia\" and \"BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia\".\n3. Identify the entities: Based on the key words, we can identify the following entities:\n * Cortical dysplasia\n * BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia\n4. Determine the type of entity: Both \"cortical dysplasia\" and \"BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia\" are diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cortical dysplasia\n2. BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia"},
