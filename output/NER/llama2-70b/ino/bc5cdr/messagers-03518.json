Identify the condition being studied: The condition being studied is bronchial asthma.\n3. Identify the population being studied: The population being studied is patients with bronchial asthma.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Bronchial asthma\n2. Patients with bronchial asthma\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the condition being studied (bronchial asthma) and the population being studied (patients with bronchial asthma)."},

Procaterol is a chemical compound that is being studied in the trial. It is a beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulant, which means it works by stimulating the beta-2 receptors in the body.\n2. Beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulant is a class of drugs that work by stimulating the beta-2 receptors in the body. In this context, it is referring to the mechanism of action of Procaterol.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities in the paragraph are Procaterol and beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulant."},
