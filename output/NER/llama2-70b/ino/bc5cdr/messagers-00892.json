Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are organelles found in the cells of most eukaryotes, and they play a crucial role in energy production and other cellular processes. They are considered chemical entities because they are composed of various chemical compounds, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which are arranged in a specific structure to perform specific functions.\n\nTherefore, the sentence \"with mitochondria being the most extensively and progressively injured subcellular organelle\" implies that the mitochondria are being damaged or injured, which is a chemical change occurring at the molecular level."},
