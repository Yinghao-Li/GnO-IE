Vitamin E is a chemical compound that belongs to the class of fat-soluble vitamins. It is a chemical entity that can be isolated and purified from natural sources or synthesized artificially.\n2. Muscles are not chemical entities in the classical sense, but they are made up of various chemical compounds such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and other biomolecules. However, when we talk about the effects of vitamin E deficiency on muscles, we are referring to the chemical changes that occur within the muscle tissue, such as the degradation of muscle fibers, which can be measured and studied using various biochemical assays. Therefore, for the purpose of this paragraph, muscles can be considered as a chemical entity."},
