Caffeine is a chemical substance that is consumed in various forms, such as coffee, tea, and chocolate. It is a stimulant that can have various effects on the body, including stimulating the central nervous system and increasing alertness.\n2. Prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) refers to the exposure of a developing fetus to caffeine during pregnancy. This can occur when a pregnant woman consumes caffeine-containing products.\n3. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is a condition where a developing fetus does not grow at a normal rate inside the womb. It can be caused by various factors, including prenatal caffeine exposure."},
