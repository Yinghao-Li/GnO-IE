Indomethacin - a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat acute gouty arthritis.\n2.

Renal insufficiency - a condition where the kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate and the ability of the kidneys to remove waste products from the blood.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are indomethacin, potassium ions (K+), and waste products."},
