However, we can identify two potential disease entities that could be relevant in this context:\n\n1. Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity: The paragraph mentions that plasma concentrations sufficient to result in CNS toxicity did not produce manifestations of cardiac toxicity. Therefore, CNS toxicity can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n2. Cardiac Toxicity: The paragraph mentions that plasma concentrations sufficient to result in CNS toxicity did not produce manifestations of cardiac toxicity. Therefore, cardiac toxicity can also be considered a disease entity in this context.\n\nSo, the two disease entities that can be identified in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
