Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, and it is considered a disease.\n2. Hyperammonemia is a condition where there is an abnormally high level of ammonia in the blood, and it is also considered a disease.\n3. Renal transplantation is a surgical procedure to replace a diseased or damaged kidney with a healthy one, and it is not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Epilepsy and Hyperammonemia."},
