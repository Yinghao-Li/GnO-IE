Glomerulonephritis\n\nGlomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease that affects the glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. It is not a specific chemical entity, but rather a medical condition that can be caused by various chemical and biological factors.\n\n3. Membranous glomerulonephritis\n\nMembranous glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerulonephritis that is characterized by the presence of thickened membranes in the glomeruli. It is also not a specific chemical entity, but rather a medical condition that can be caused by various chemical and biological factors.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is Amiodarone."},
