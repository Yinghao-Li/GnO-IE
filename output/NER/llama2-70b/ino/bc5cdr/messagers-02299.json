Hypercalcemia is a medical condition in which the level of calcium in the blood is abnormally high. It is a disease or disorder that affects the body's mineral homeostasis.\n2. Phosphate binder refers to a medication or substance used to bind to phosphate in the gut and prevent its absorption into the bloodstream. In this context, it is being used to treat hyperphosphatemia (high levels of phosphate in the blood), which is a common complication in patients with kidney failure who are undergoing dialysis.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are hypercalcemia and phosphate binder."},
