Pronounced changes in the surface ECG (cycle length, QT, and QTc)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Torsades de pointes is a type of ventricular fibrillation that can be caused by a prolonged QT interval, which is a disturbance in the heart's electrical activity. It is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.\n2. Pronounced changes in the surface ECG (cycle length, QT, and QTc) are abnormalities in the heart's electrical activity that can increase the risk of developing torsades de pointes. These changes can be detected by measuring the duration of the QT interval and other parameters on an electrocardiogram (ECG).\n\nTherefore, both torsades de pointes and pronounced changes in the surface ECG are disease entities in the paragraph."},

Torsades de pointes is a type of ventricular fibrillation that can be caused by a prolonged QT interval, which is a disturbance in the heart's electrical activity.
