The paragraph suggests that the low contribution of de-novo synthesis to cellular inositol supply may be a reason for the lack of effects.\n2. lithium: Lithium is a drug that is used to treat bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions. The paragraph suggests that lithium may inhibit the de-novo synthesis of inositol, which may also contribute to the lack of effects.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are de-novo synthesis and lithium, as they are both related to the regulation of inositol levels in cells and may have an impact on cellular processes."},

Lithium: Lithium is a drug that is used to treat bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions. The paragraph suggests that lithium may inhibit the de-novo synthesis of inositol, which may also contribute to the lack of effects. Lithium is a disease entity in this context because it is a drug used to treat a mental health condition.\n\nThe other entity mentioned in the paragraph, de-novo synthesis, is not a disease entity in this context. It is a process by which cells synthesize inositol from scratch, and while it may be related to the regulation of inositol levels in cells, it is not a disease entity in and of itself."},
