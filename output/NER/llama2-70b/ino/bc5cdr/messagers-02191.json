Mitochondrial defect\n\nBoth of these entities can be classified as \"Disease\" or \"Disorder\" because they describe abnormalities or malfunctions in the body that can cause harm or illness. \"Cardiac dysfunction\" refers to impaired functioning of the heart, which can lead to various cardiovascular problems, while \"mitochondrial defect\" refers to an abnormality in the mitochondria, which can disrupt normal cellular function and lead to various diseases or disorders."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's the revised list of entities that clearly refer to Disease or Disorder:\n\n1. Cardiac dysfunction\n2. Mitochondrial defect\n\nThe phrase \"cocaine-induced\" modifies the entity \"cardiac dysfunction\" and indicates that the dysfunction is caused by the use of cocaine. Therefore, \"cardiac dysfunction\" is still a valid entity in this context.\n\nOn the other hand, \"mitochondrial defect\" is a clear entity that refers to a disease or disorder, as it describes an abnormality in the mitochondria that can disrupt normal cellular function.\n\nI hope this helps!
