Hypertension\n\nHypertension is a disease characterized by abnormally high blood pressure, and it is mentioned in the paragraph as a condition that is associated with enhanced oxidative stress. Therefore, it is a relevant entity for the \"Disease\" category.\n\nOxidative stress, on the other hand, is not a disease in itself, but rather a physiological state that can have negative effects on the body. It is mentioned in the paragraph as a consequence of dexamethasone-induced hypertension, but it is not a disease entity in this context.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is hypertension."},
