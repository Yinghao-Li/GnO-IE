QT prolongation - This is a cardiac disorder characterized by an abnormal prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram.\n2. Cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors - This is a class of drugs that inhibit the activity of the enzyme cytochrome P-450 3A4, which is responsible for metabolizing many drugs in the body. Inhibition of this enzyme can lead to increased drug concentrations and adverse effects, including QT prolongation.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* QT prolongation\n* Cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors (not a disease itself, but a class of drugs that can contribute to QT prolongation)"},
