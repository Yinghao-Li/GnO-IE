Q waves\n\nThese are all chemical entities because they are related to the levels of various proteins, enzymes, and other chemicals in the blood that are used to diagnose and monitor cardiovascular disease.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each entity:\n\n1. Cardiac biomarkers: These are proteins or other molecules that are released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged. Examples include troponin and creatine kinase.\n2. ST segment: This is a segment of the electrocardiogram (ECG) that represents the electrical activity of the heart muscle. It is used to diagnose various cardiac conditions, including myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n3. T wave: This is a segment of the ECG that represents the electrical activity of the heart muscle during the ventricular repolarization phase. Abnormal T waves can indicate cardiac disease.\n4. Q waves: These are abnormal waves on the ECG that can indicate cardiac disease, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nI hope this helps!
