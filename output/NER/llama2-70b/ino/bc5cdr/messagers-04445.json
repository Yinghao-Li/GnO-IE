Postinfarct dysrhythmias\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a type of arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm that originates in the ventricles. It is a potentially life-threatening condition that can lead to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.\n* Postinfarct dysrhythmias refer to abnormal heart rhythms that occur after a myocardial infarction (heart attack). These dysrhythmias can include various types of arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and atrial fibrillation.\n\nTherefore, both VT and postinfarct dysrhythmias can be classified as \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},
