Brain pathologies\n\nThese two entities can be classified as diseases because they are referring to abnormal conditions that affect the brain and can cause harm or damage to the body. The neuroinflammatory cascade is a series of cellular and molecular events that lead to inflammation in the brain, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, injury, or autoimmune disorders. Brain pathologies refer to any abnormality or disease that affects the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, or brain tumors."},

Brain pathologies\n\nThe entity \"CCR2\" is a chemokine receptor, which is not a disease. The entity \"CCL2\" is a chemokine ligand, which is also not a disease. The interaction between CCR2 and CCL2 may play a role in the development or progression of certain diseases, but the entities themselves are not diseases.\n\nTherefore, the final list of disease entities in the paragraph is:\n\n1.
