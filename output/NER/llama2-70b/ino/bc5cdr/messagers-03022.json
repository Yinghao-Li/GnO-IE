Thrombectomy is a medical procedure to remove a blood clot or thrombus from a blood vessel. It is not a disease entity but a treatment procedure.\n2. Revascularization is a medical procedure that restores blood flow to a specific area of the body. It is not a disease entity but a treatment outcome.\n3. SVC (Superior Vena Cava) is a blood vessel that carries deoxygenated blood from the head, neck, and upper limbs to the right atrium of the heart. It is not a disease entity but a normal anatomical structure.\n4. Central veins are blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood from the body to the heart. They are not disease entities but normal anatomical structures.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
