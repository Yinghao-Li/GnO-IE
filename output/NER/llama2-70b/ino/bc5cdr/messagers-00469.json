Persistent sterile leukocyturia\n\nThe term \"leukocyturia\" refers to the presence of white blood cells in the urine, which can be a sign of a urinary tract infection or other kidney problems. \"Persistent\" and \"sterile\" are adjectives that modify the noun \"leukocyturia\" and indicate that the condition is ongoing and not caused by a bacterial infection, respectively. Therefore, \"persistent sterile leukocyturia\" can be considered a disease entity in the paragraph."},
