    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the main entities in the sentence:\n * METH\n * mice\n * depressive-like behavior\n * frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic homoeostasis\n2. Determine which of these entities are diseases:\n * Depressive-like behavior can be considered a disease or a disorder.\n * Frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic homoeostasis is not a disease, but rather a physiological process that is disrupted in certain diseases.\n3. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n * Depressive-like behavior\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nDisease entities:\n\n1. Depressive-like behavior"},
