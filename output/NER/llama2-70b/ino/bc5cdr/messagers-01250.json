Polyarteritis nodosa is a disease, specifically a type of vasculitis, which is a condition that affects the blood vessels.\n2. American College of Rheumatology is an organization that provides criteria for the classification of diseases, including polyarteritis nodosa.\n3. 1990 criteria refer to the specific criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology in 1990 for the classification of polyarteritis nodosa.\n\nTherefore, the three entities in the paragraph that relate to disease are:\n\n1. Polyarteritis nodosa (the disease itself)\n2. American College of Rheumatology (the organization that established the criteria for classifying the disease)\n3. 1990 criteria (the specific criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology for classifying polyarteritis nodosa)"},
