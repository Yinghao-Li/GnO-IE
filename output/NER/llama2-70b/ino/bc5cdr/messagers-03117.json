Isoproterenol - Isoproterenol is a medication used to treat various conditions such as asthma, angina, and heart failure. It is a beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist, which means it stimulates the heart and lungs to increase heart rate and force of contraction, and dilates the airways, respectively.\n2. Chronic pre-treatment with metformin - Metformin is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. Chronic pre-treatment with metformin in this context means that the rats were treated with metformin for a period of time (14 days) before being injected with isoproterenol.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Isoproterenol\n* Chronic pre-treatment with metformin"},
