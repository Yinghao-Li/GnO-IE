It is a disease entity in the sense that it is a recognized medical condition with a specific set of symptoms and diagnostic criteria.\n* Pentylenetetrazole is a drug that is known to induce anxiety-like behavior in animals, and is often used as a model of anxiety in scientific research. It is therefore considered a disease entity in the context of the paragraph, as it is being used to induce a disease-like state in the mice being studied."},
