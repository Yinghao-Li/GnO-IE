Proliferation - This refers to the process of cell division and growth, which involves various chemical reactions and interactions between molecules.\n2. Migration - This refers to the movement of cells or molecules from one place to another, which involves chemical signals and interactions between molecules.\n3. Maturation - This refers to the process of cells or tissues becoming mature or developed, which involves a series of chemical changes and interactions between molecules.\n\nTherefore, the three chemical entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
