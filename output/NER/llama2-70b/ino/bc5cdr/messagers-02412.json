S. virgaurea extract: This is a chemical mixture of compounds extracted from the plant S. virgaurea.\n2. MDA (malondialdehyde): This is a chemical compound that is a product of lipid peroxidation and is often used as a marker of oxidative stress.\n3. Isoproterenol: This is a chemical compound that is a beta-adrenergic agonist, which means it stimulates the beta-adrenergic receptor and can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose metabolism.\n4. Antioxidant status: This refers to the level of antioxidants present in the body, which can help protect against oxidative stress.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* S. virgaurea extract\n* MDA\n* Isoproterenol\n* Antioxidant status"},
