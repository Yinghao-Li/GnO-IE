TBPS (35S) binding refers to the binding of a radioactive tracer, [35S], to a target protein, TBPS. This is a biochemical process that is often used to study the interactions between drugs and their target proteins.\n2. Isoniazid-induced biochemical and pharmacological effects refer to the changes that occur in the body as a result of administering the drug isoniazid. Isoniazid is a medication used to treat tuberculosis, and it can have various effects on the body, including changes in biochemical processes and pharmacological responses."},
