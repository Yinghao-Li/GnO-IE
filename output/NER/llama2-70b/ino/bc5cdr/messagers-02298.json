Hypercalcemia is a medical condition characterized by an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood.\n2. Hemodialysis is a medical procedure that filters and purifies the blood in patients with kidney failure.\n3. Calcium carbonate therapy refers to the use of calcium carbonate as a treatment for certain medical conditions, such as hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or osteoporosis.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the conditions or procedures that are directly related to the patient's health and medical treatment."},
