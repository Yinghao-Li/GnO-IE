DSP4 is a neurotoxin that can cause damage to the nervous system, particularly the noradrenergic system. It is considered a disease entity because it can cause harm to the body.\n2. D-amphetamine is a psychoactive substance that can cause addiction and various physiological and psychological effects, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and dopamine levels. It is also considered a disease entity because it can cause harm to the body and mind.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are DSP4 and D-amphetamine."},
