U/ml (units per milliliter)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. MPO-ANCA titre is a measure of the level of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in the blood, specifically targeting myeloperoxidase (MPO). It is a chemical entity as it is a quantitative measure of the presence of a specific protein in the blood.\n2. PTU (propylthiouracil) is a chemical entity as it is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism.\n3. U/ml (units per milliliter) is a unit of measurement used to express the concentration of a substance in a given volume of solution. It is a chemical entity as it is a standard unit of measurement used in clinical contexts."},
