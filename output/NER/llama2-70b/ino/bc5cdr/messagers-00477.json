Area under the curve of indinavir > 19 mg/L x h\n5. C (max) > 12 mg/L\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Nephrotoxicity is a disease entity as it is a toxic effect of indinavir on the kidneys.\n2. Persistent sterile leukocyturia is a disease entity as it is a urinary tract infection without bacteria.\n3. Age < 5.6 years is not a disease entity, but rather a risk factor for nephrotoxicity.\n4. Area under the curve of indinavir > 19 mg/L x h is not a disease entity, but rather a measure of the drug concentration in the body.\n5. C (max) > 12 mg/L is not a disease entity, but rather a measure of the drug concentration in the body.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are Nephrotoxicity and Persistent sterile leukocyturia."},
