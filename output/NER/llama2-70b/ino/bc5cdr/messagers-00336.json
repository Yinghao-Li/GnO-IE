Fatty liver\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Fatty liver is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fat in liver cells.\n\nThe mention of \"tetracycline-induced fatty liver\" does not refer to a disease, but rather a specific type of fatty liver that is caused by the administration of the antibiotic tetracycline. Therefore, it is not a disease entity in this context."},
