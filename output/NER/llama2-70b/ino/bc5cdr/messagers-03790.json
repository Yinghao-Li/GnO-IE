Phenotypically normal heterozygous (jJ)\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this paragraph, the author is mentioning two types of animals: homozygous (jj) and phenotypically normal heterozygous (jJ). Homozygous animals have two copies of the same allele (jj), while heterozygous animals have two different alleles (jJ). The author is using these animals to study a genetic trait or disease, and the homozygous animals are likely to be used as a control group or to study the effects of a specific genetic mutation. Therefore, both homozygous and heterozygous animals can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this context."},
