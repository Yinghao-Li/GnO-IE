Statin-induced muscle toxicity\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Simvastatin is a statin, a type of medication used to treat high cholesterol.\n* Statin-induced muscle toxicity is a known side effect of statin medications, and it occurs when the statin causes damage to the muscles.\n* The paragraph suggests that the concentration of simvastatin in the patient's blood increased 30 times, which may have contributed to the development of muscle toxicity.\n\nTherefore, \"statin-induced muscle toxicity\" is a disease entity in the paragraph."},
