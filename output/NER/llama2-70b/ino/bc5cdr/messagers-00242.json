It is a disease entity in its own right, and can also be considered a symptom of other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease.\n* Menopause is a natural biological process that occurs in women, characterized by the cessation of menstruation. While it is not typically considered a disease, it can be associated with various symptoms and disorders, such as hot flashes, night sweats, and mood changes.\n\nTherefore, both Parkinsonism and menopause can be identified as disease entities in the paragraph."},
