They are the \"disease\" entities because they are the cause of the harmful effects described in the paragraph. The paragraph mentions the death rate associated with each substance, which further supports the idea that they are the disease entities."},

Cocaine\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhile the paragraph does mention death rates associated with amphetamine and cocaine, it's important to note that death rate is not a disease entity. The paragraph is describing the toxic effects of these substances, and the death rate is a consequence of those effects. Therefore, the only disease entities in the paragraph are the substances themselves, which are amphetamine and cocaine."},
