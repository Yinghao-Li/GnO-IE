Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * coronary artery disease\n * hearts\n * patients\n * VIP concentration\n * protein\n * transplant\n2. Determine which entities are diseases:\n * coronary artery disease (yes, it is a disease)\n3. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n * coronary artery disease\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nDisease entities:\n\n1. Coronary artery disease"},
