This is a disease or condition that affects the cardiovascular system.\n2. \"bilateral medullo-adrenalectomy\" - This is a surgical procedure that involves removing the adrenal glands. This is a disease or condition that affects the endocrine system.\n3. \"reduction in heart rate\" - This is a symptom of a disease or condition that affects the cardiovascular system.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
