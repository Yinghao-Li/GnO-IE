Water is a chemical compound made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms (H2O).\n2. Alcalinization - Alcalinization refers to the process of increasing the pH level of the body by administering alkaline substances. Alkaline substances are chemical compounds that have a pH level higher than 7, which is the normal pH range of the body. Examples of alkaline substances include bicarbonate (HCO3-), carbonate (CO32-), and hydroxide (OH-) ions.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Water (H2O)\n* Hydrogen ions (H+)\n* Oxygen ions (O2-)\n* Bicarbonate ions (HCO3-)\n* Carbonate ions (CO32-)\n* Hydroxide ions (OH-)"},
