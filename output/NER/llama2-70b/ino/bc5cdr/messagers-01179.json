Cardiac hypertrophy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes enlarged, which can lead to various complications such as heart failure.\n2. Low brain angiotensinogen refers to a decrease in the levels of angiotensinogen in the brain, which can contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy.\n\nTherefore, both cardiac hypertrophy and low brain angiotensinogen can be considered as disease entities in this paragraph."},

Cardiac hypertrophy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes enlarged, which can lead to various complications such as heart failure. It is a clear reference to a disease.\n\nThe mention of low brain angiotensinogen is not a clear reference to a disease, as it could also refer to a physiological state or a genetic trait.
