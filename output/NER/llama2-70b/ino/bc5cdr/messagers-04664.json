Placebo - This is a substance that has no active therapeutic effects, but is used as a control in the study to compare the effects of the ibuprofen. The placebo is likely a sugar pill or a dummy drug that resembles the actual drug but contains no active ingredients.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are ibuprofen and placebo."},
