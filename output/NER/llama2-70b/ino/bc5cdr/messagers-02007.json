Hepatomegaly\n\nHepatomegaly is a condition where the liver becomes enlarged, which can be a symptom of various liver diseases. Therefore, it is a clear reference to disease.\n\nThe mention of \"enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation\" does not necessarily refer to a specific disease, but rather a physiological response that can potentially lead to disease.
