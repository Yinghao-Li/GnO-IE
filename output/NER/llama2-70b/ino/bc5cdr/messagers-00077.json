Parkinson's disease (PD) - The paragraph mentions \"substantia nigra\", which is a part of the brain affected by Parkinson's disease.\n2. Haloperidol - treated animals - Haloperidol is a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, so the animals treated with haloperidol are likely to have Parkinson's disease.\n3. L-NOARG-treated animals - L-NOARG is a drug that has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease, so the animals treated with L-NOARG may have Parkinson's disease or be at risk of developing it.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Parkinson's disease, haloperidol-treated animals, and L-NOARG-treated animals."},
