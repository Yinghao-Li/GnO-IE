Cancer: The paragraph mentions \"the development of cancer stem cells\" as one of the underlying mechanisms by which early-life iAs exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects. Cancer is a disease that is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.\n2. Cancer stem cells: Cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of cancer cells that have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell types, leading to the development of cancer. They are considered a key factor in the development and progression of cancer.\n\nTherefore, both cancer and cancer stem cells can be identified as \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph."},
