However, we can identify two entities that could be related to diseases:\n\n1. \"mean arterial pressure\" (MAP) - MAP is a measure of blood pressure, and abnormal blood pressure levels can be indicative of various cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension or hypotension.\n2. \"cimetidine\" - Cimetidine is a medication used to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It is not directly related to blood pressure or cardiovascular diseases, but it could be used to treat symptoms associated with certain diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypertension (related to mean arterial pressure)\n2. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (related to cimetidine)\n3. Peptic ulcers (related to cimetidine)\n4. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (related to cimetidine)"},

Hypertension\n\nThe mention of \"mean arterial pressure\" (MAP) is related to hypertension, which is a disease characterized by high blood pressure.
