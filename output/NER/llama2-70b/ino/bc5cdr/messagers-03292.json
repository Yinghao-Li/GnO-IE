The \"p\" symbol before each variant indicates that it is a protein.\n2. Tetrameric enzyme refers to a protein complex composed of four subunits.\n3. Plasma is a liquid component of blood.\n4. Electrophoresis gels are a medium used in electrophoresis, a technique used to separate and analyze mixtures of charged particles, such as proteins.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the protein variants, the tetrameric enzyme, and the electrophoresis gels."},
