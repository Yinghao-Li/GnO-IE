Recurrence rate refers to the rate at which a disease or condition returns after treatment or a period of remission. In this paragraph, the recurrence rate is 3.9%, indicating that 3.9% of the patients in the study had a recurrence of their disease.\n2. Median follow-up refers to the median length of time after treatment or diagnosis that the patients in the study were followed up. In this paragraph, the median follow-up was 14.1 months, meaning that half of the patients were followed up for more than 14.1 months, and half were followed up for less than 14.1 months.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Recurrence rate and Median follow-up."},
