Contrast material: This is a chemical substance used in medical imaging to enhance the visibility of internal structures on X-rays or other imaging techniques. It is a chemical entity because it is a substance composed of atoms or molecules with a specific chemical structure and properties.\n2. Acute renal failure (ARF): This is a medical condition where the kidneys suddenly stop functioning properly, leading to a build-up of waste products in the blood. While ARF is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, it is a medical condition that can be caused by chemical factors, such as the use of certain medications or exposure to toxins. In this context, ARF is a chemical entity because it is a condition that can be caused by the administration of contrast material."},
