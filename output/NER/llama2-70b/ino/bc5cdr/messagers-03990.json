Vasopressin: Vasopressin is a hormone that regulates water balance in the body and has a role in blood pressure regulation. It is a chemical messenger that acts on the kidneys and blood vessels to increase water reabsorption and blood pressure, respectively.\n2. Hypertensive process: Hypertension is a condition of elevated blood pressure. The term \"hypertensive process\" refers to the various physiological and biochemical changes that occur in the body due to high blood pressure. This includes changes in blood vessels, the heart, and the kidneys, which can lead to further increases in blood pressure and damage to these organs.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Vasopressin\n2. Hypertensive process (although not a specific chemical entity, it is a chemical process that involves various chemical changes in the body)"},
