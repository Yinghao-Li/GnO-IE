Seizure - This is a disorder characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, leading to uncontrolled movements and loss of consciousness.\n2. Convulsant effects of nicotine - This refers to the ability of nicotine to cause seizures or convulsions in some individuals.\n3. Alpha-bungarotoxin binding - This is a measure of the binding of a toxin called alpha-bungarotoxin to specific receptors in the brain, which can be affected by various diseases or disorders.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Seizure\n* Convulsant effects of nicotine\n* Alpha-bungarotoxin binding (as it is a measure of a disease or disorder)"},
