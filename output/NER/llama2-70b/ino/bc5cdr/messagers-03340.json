Oxidative stress\n\nOxidative stress is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. It can lead to cellular damage and contribute to various diseases and disorders, such as cancer, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nTherefore, \"oxidative stress\" can be considered a disease entity in this context."},
