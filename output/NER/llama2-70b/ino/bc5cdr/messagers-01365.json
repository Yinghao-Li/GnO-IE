Electrocardiography (ECG) - a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart, which is a chemical process.\n3. Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) - a type of abnormal heartbeat caused by abnormal electrical activity in the heart muscle, which is a chemical process.\n4. Trigemini - a type of abnormal heartbeat caused by abnormal electrical activity in the heart muscle, which is a chemical process.\n5. Sinoatrial block - a condition where the electrical impulses that control the heart's rhythm are blocked or delayed, which is a chemical process.\n6. Positive U wave - a type of abnormality in the electrical activity of the heart, which is a chemical process.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Quinine\n2.
