Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is the incidence of solid tumors among pesticide applicators exposed to the organophosphate insecticide diazinon.\n2. Identify the population being studied: The population being studied is pesticide applicators exposed to the organophosphate insecticide diazinon.\n3. Identify the outcome being studied: The outcome being studied is the incidence of solid tumors among the population of pesticide applicators exposed to diazinon.\n4. Identify any mention of a disease or condition: The paragraph mentions \"solid tumors\" which can be considered a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Solid tumors"},
