Re, Rg1, and Rb1 are all substances that are being administered to the mice during withdrawal, and are therefore also disease entities.\n\nNote that the paragraph does not provide any information about the nature of the substances being administered, so we cannot determine whether they are drugs, toxins, or other types of substances."},
