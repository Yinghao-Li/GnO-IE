Kinin B2 receptor antagonist - a type of drug that blocks the action of kinin B2 receptors, which are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and inflammation.\n3. Serum creatinine - a waste product that is produced by the breakdown of creatine in muscles and is normally removed from the blood by the kidneys.\n4. Blood urea - a waste product that is produced when the body breaks down protein and is normally removed from the blood by the kidneys.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Cisplatin\n* Kinin B2 receptor antagonist\n* Serum creatinine\n* Blood urea"},
