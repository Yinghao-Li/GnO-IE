Hypotension is a condition of abnormally low blood pressure, which can be caused by various factors, including the administration of certain drugs like cimetidine.\n2. Vasodilating activity refers to the widening of blood vessels, which can lead to a decrease in blood pressure. In this paragraph, cimetidine is said to have vasodilating activity through the H1 receptor, which contributes to its hypotensive effect.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are hypotension and vasodilating activity."},
