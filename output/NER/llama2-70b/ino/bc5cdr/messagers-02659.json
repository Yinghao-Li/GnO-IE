Wistar rats - The animals used in the experiment, not a disease entity.\n2. DOX - The drug used in the experiment, not a disease entity.\n3. Intraperitoneally - The route of administration of the drug, not a disease entity.\n4. Experimental protocols - The methods used in the experiment, not a disease entity.\n5. Killed - This refers to the act of euthanizing the animals, not a disease entity.\n6. Acute effect - This refers to the short-term effects of the drug, not a disease entity.\n7. Chronological effects - This refers to the long-term effects of the drug, not a disease entity.\n\nSo, there are no disease entities mentioned in the paragraph. The paragraph only describes an experiment using rats to study the effects of a drug."},

It is a synthetic anthracycline that is used as a chemotherapy agent.\n2. Body weight: Body weight is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the paragraph as a parameter for determining the dose of DOX.\n3. mg/kg: mg/kg is a unit of measurement that represents milligrams per kilogram. It is used to express the dose of DOX in relation to the body weight of the rats.\n4. week: Week is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned as a time period in the paragraph.\n5. M0, M1, M2, M3, M4: M0, M1, M2, M3, and M4 are not chemical entities, but they represent different time points at which the rats were killed and sampled.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
