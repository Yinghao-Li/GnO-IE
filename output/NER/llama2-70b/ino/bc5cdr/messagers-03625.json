Uninephrectomized: This refers to the surgical removal of one kidney, which is a disease state in the rat model used in the study.\n2. AMNS: AMNS stands for \"adriamycin,\" a chemotherapy drug that is used to induce kidney damage and disease in animal models.\n3. PS: PS stands for \"prostaglandin synthetase,\" an enzyme that is involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that play a role in inflammation and immune response. Prostaglandin synthetase is often used as a marker of inflammation in disease states.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the surgical removal of one kidney, the administration of a chemotherapy drug (adriamycin) to induce kidney damage, and the measurement of prostaglandin synthetase as a marker of inflammation."},
