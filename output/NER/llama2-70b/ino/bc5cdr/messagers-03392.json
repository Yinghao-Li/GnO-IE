Podocin\n3. q-PCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Nephrin and podocin are proteins, which are chemical molecules composed of amino acids. They are marker genes that are specifically expressed in podocytes, and their reduced expression level was detected in the damaged podocytes.\n2. q-PCR is a laboratory technique used to amplify and quantify specific DNA sequences. It involves the use of chemical reagents and enzymes to synthesize complementary DNA strands and detect the resulting PCR product.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are nephrin, podocin, and the reagents and enzymes used in the q-PCR technique."},
