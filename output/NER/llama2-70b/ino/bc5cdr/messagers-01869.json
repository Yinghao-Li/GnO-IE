Oxidant stress: This is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds. Over time, oxidant stress can damage cellular components and contribute to the development of various diseases, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n2. Lipid peroxidation: This is a process in which lipids are damaged by ROS, leading to the formation of toxic compounds that can further propagate oxidative stress and contribute to cellular damage. Lipid peroxidation is associated with various diseases, including atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nTherefore, both oxidant stress and lipid peroxidation can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of this paragraph."},
