Gentamicin-treated rats\n\nExplanation: The paragraph states that the rats were treated with gentamicin, which is an antibiotic that can cause kidney damage and other side effects. Therefore, the rats in this context can be considered as having a disease or condition caused by the gentamicin treatment.\n\n2. Decreased expression of Na ( + ) / K ( + ) - ATPase , NHE3 , NBC1 , and AQP1 in the kidney\n\nExplanation: The paragraph mentions that the expression of certain proteins (Na ( + ) / K ( + ) - ATPase , NHE3 , NBC1 , and AQP1) in the kidney of the gentamicin-treated rats was decreased. This decrease in protein expression could be an indication of a disease or condition affecting the kidney, such as kidney damage or dysfunction."},
