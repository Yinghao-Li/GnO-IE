Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is about the administration of a combination of drugs to patients with a specific type of cancer.\n2. Identify the type of cancer mentioned in the paragraph: The type of cancer mentioned is squamous cell cervical carcinoma.\n3. Identify the entities that are related to the cancer: The entities related to the cancer are \"recurrent squamous cell cervical carcinoma\" and \"squamous cell cervical carcinoma\".\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
