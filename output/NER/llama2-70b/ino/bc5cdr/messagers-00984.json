Ischemic brain injury and temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion are both conditions that can cause damage to the brain, while hypertension and blood-brain barrier permeability are both related to abnormal blood flow and pressure in the brain."},

Hypertension\n\nThese two entities are the most relevant to the topic of disease in the paragraph. Temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion is a procedure that is used to model ischemic brain injury in animals, and blood-brain barrier permeability is a measure of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, which can be affected by various diseases and disorders. However, they are not directly diseases or disorders themselves."},
