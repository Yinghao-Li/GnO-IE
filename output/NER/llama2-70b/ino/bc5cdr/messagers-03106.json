Myocardial injury\n2. Cytotoxicity\n\nThe paragraph mentions the effect of aconitine on myocardial injury, which is a type of damage to the heart muscle. Cytotoxicity is also a type of cell damage that is being studied in the context of myocardial injury. Therefore, both myocardial injury and cytotoxicity can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},
