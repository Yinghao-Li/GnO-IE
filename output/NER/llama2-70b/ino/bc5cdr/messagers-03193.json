Simvastatin is a chemical entity because it is a medication, specifically a statin, which is a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol levels.\n2. Antiviral drugs are chemical entities because they are medications that are designed to prevent or treat viral infections. The term \"antiviral drugs\" encompasses a broad range of chemical compounds that are used to target viruses and prevent their replication or entry into host cells.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the given paragraph are simvastatin and antiviral drugs."},

Simvastatin is a chemical entity because it is a medication, specifically a statin, which is a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol levels.\n\nThe term \"antiviral drugs\" is not specific enough to be considered a chemical entity, as it refers to a broad category of drugs rather than a specific chemical compound.
