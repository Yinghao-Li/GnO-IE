Identify the keywords related to disease:\n\nThe keywords related to disease in the paragraph are:\n\n* stenosis\n* hypertension (equihypotensive doses)\n\n2. Identify the entities related to disease:\n\nBased on the keywords, we can identify the following entities related to disease:\n\n* Stenosis (as a disease)\n* Hypertension (as a disease)\n\n3. Identify the entities that are not diseases:\n\nThe following entities in the paragraph are not diseases:\n\n* CD-832\n* Nifedipine\n* Diltiazem\n* ISO infusion\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Stenosis\n* Hypertension"},
