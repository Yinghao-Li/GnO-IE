Genotoxicity refers to the ability of a substance to damage the genetic material (DNA) within cells, which can lead to mutations, cancer, and other diseases.\n2. Cytostatic action refers to the ability of a substance to inhibit or stop the growth and division of cells, which can be a desirable effect in cancer treatment.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph suggests that Mesna can reduce the genotoxicity of IFO, while high concentrations of Mesna can inhibit the cytostatic action of the drug."},
