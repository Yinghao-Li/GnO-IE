Cardiac enzymes are chemical substances produced by the heart muscle that can be measured in the blood to diagnose heart damage or disease.\n2. Electrocardiographic (EKG) changes refer to changes in the electrical activity of the heart, which can be measured by an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) test. While not strictly a chemical entity, EKG changes can be indicative of chemical imbalances or abnormalities in the body."},
