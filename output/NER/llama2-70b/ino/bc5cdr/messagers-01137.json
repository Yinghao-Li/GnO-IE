High serum FBAL concentration (1955 ng/ml)\n\nThese three entities are all medical conditions or abnormalities that are affecting the patient's health. Precordial pain refers to chest pain that occurs in the front of the chest, often a symptom of a heart condition. Right bundle branch block is a condition where there is a delay or blockage in the electrical impulses that travel through the right bundle branch of the heart. High serum FBAL concentration (1955 ng/ml) indicates that the patient has an elevated level of a certain enzyme (FBAL) in their blood, which can be indicative of liver damage or disease."},
