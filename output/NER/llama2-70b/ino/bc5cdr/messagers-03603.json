Tumor: A tumor is an abnormal growth of cells that can be benign or malignant. In this paragraph, the stability of tumor size is being compared between pretransplant and post-transplant scans.\n2. Peritumor edema: Peritumor edema refers to the swelling of the brain tissue surrounding a tumor. In this paragraph, the stability of peritumor edema is also being compared between pretransplant and post-transplant scans.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are Tumor and Peritumor edema."},
