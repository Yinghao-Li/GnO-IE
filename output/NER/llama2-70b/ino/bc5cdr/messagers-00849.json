Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) - a chemical compound that plays a key role in muscle physiology and is often used as a diagnostic marker for muscle damage.\n2. Creatine - a chemical compound that is important for muscle energy production.\n3. Phosphokinase - an enzyme that adds a phosphate group to creatine to form creatine phosphate, which is then used to regenerate ATP in muscles.\n4. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) - a chemical compound that is the primary energy currency of the cell and is involved in many cellular processes, including muscle contraction.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Creatine phosphokinase (CPK)\n* Creatine\n* Phosphokinase\n* ATP (adenosine triphosphate)"},
