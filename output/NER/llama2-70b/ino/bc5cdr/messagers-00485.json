It is also known as a heart attack.\n* Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) is a protein that is released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged. Elevated levels of cTnI in the blood can indicate myocardial infarction or other cardiac conditions.\n\nTherefore, both MI and cTnI elevations are considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},
