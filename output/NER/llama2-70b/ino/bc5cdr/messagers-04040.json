Succinylcholine is a chemical compound that is used as a neuromuscular blocking drug.\n2. Anticholinesterases are a class of drugs that inhibit the enzyme cholinesterase, which is responsible for breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the nervous system.\n3. Plasma cholinesterase is an enzyme found in the blood that is responsible for breaking down acetylcholine. The phrase \"atypical plasma cholinesterase\" suggests that the patient had a variant form of this enzyme that was not functioning normally."},
