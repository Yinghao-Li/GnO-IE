However, 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) protein adducts are known to be associated with various diseases, including:\n\n1. Aging: 4HNE is a lipid peroxidation product that accumulates with age and has been implicated in the aging process.\n2. Neurodegenerative diseases: 4HNE has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.\n3. Cancer: 4HNE has been shown to be elevated in various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and colon cancer.\n4. Cardiovascular diseases: 4HNE has been linked to cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph can be inferred as:\n\n1. Aging\n2. Neurodegenerative diseases\n3. Cancer\n4. Cardiovascular diseases"},
