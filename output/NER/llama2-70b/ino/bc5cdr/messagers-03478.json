Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are:\n\n1. Asthma\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"twelve asthmatic patients\" who were enrolled in the clinical trial. Therefore, \"asthma\" is the first \"Disease\" entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n2. FEV1\n\nThe paragraph also mentions \"FEV1\" (forced expiratory volume in one second) which is a measure of lung function that is often used to diagnose and monitor asthma. Therefore, \"FEV1\" can be considered a \"Disease\" entity in this context.\n\nSo, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Asthma\n2. FEV1"},
