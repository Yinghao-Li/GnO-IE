The term \"epileptic group\" refers to a group of animals that have epilepsy, which is a neurological disorder or disease. The term \"control animals\" refers to a group of animals that do not have epilepsy and are used as a baseline for comparison. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are epilepsy and the control condition (i.e., the absence of epilepsy)."},
