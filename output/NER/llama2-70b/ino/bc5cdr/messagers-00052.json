Identify the cells mentioned in the paragraph:\n * HL60 cells\n * Human bone marrow progenitor (HBMP) cells\n2. Determine whether these cells are affected by a disease or condition:\n * HL60 cells are a type of leukemia cell line, so they are already diseased cells.\n * Human bone marrow progenitor (HBMP) cells are not necessarily diseased cells, but they can be affected by various bone marrow disorders or diseases.\n3. Identify the disease or condition associated with the cells:\n * HL60 cells: Leukemia\n * HBMP cells: Various bone marrow disorders or diseases (not specified in the paragraph)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Leukemia (associated with HL60 cells)\n2. Bone marrow disorders or diseases (associated with HBMP cells)"},
