Cardiac events: The term \"cardiac events\" refers to any events related to the heart, such as heart attacks, strokes, arrhythmias, etc. These events can be caused by various chemical substances, such as drugs, toxins, or pollutants, that affect the heart's functioning.\n2. Toxic deaths: The term \"toxic deaths\" refers to deaths caused by the exposure to toxic substances, such as chemicals, drugs, or other harmful substances. Toxic substances can cause damage to various organs, including the heart, leading to cardiac events.\n3. Cardiac event-related deaths: This term refers to deaths that occur as a result of cardiac events, such as heart attacks or strokes, which can be caused by various chemical substances, including drugs, toxins, or pollutants.\n\nTherefore, all three entities in the given paragraph can be classified as \"Chemical\" entities."},
