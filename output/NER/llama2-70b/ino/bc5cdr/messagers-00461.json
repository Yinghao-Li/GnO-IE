Indinavir is a chemical compound that is used as a drug to treat HIV infection. It is a protease inhibitor that prevents the virus from replicating by blocking the protease enzyme.\n2. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
