To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can look for words or phrases that refer to medical conditions or disorders.\n\n1. \"MB\" - This could refer to a medical condition, so let's flag it as a potential disease entity.\n2. \"ICH\" - This is an abbreviation for \"intracerebral hemorrhage,\" which is a type of stroke caused by bleeding in the brain. So, this is a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. MB\n2. ICH"},
