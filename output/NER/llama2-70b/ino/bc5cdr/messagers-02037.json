Total parenteral nutrition\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Renal function recovery refers to the restoration of normal kidney function, which was likely impaired due to a disease or injury.\n2. HD - MTX therapy is a treatment for kidney disease, specifically hemodialysis and methotrexate therapy.\n3. Ileostoma is a surgically created opening in the small intestine, which is often used to treat diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or cancer.\n4. Total parenteral nutrition is a type of nutritional support that is administered intravenously, bypassing the digestive system, and is used to treat various diseases or conditions that affect nutritional absorption."},
