It is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps to replace the dopamine that is lost in Parkinson's disease.\n\nDyskinesias are involuntary movements that can be a side effect of long-term use of levodopa. They are caused by the drug's effect on the brain's dopamine system.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are levodopa and dyskinesias, both of which are related to the chemical dopamine."},
