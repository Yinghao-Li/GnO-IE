Status epilepticus is a disease state characterized by prolonged seizures or recurrent seizures occurring over a short period of time.\n2. The lithium-pilocarpine model is a disease model used to study status epilepticus in rats. It is induced by administering lithium and pilocarpine to rats, which causes seizures and mimics the symptoms of status epilepticus."},
