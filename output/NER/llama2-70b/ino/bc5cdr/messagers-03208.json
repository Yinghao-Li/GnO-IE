It is a categorical variable that describes the response of cancer to treatment, with values such as \"complete response,\" \"near complete response,\" \"partial response,\" and \"no response.\" VGPR is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, but it is a term used in the context of cancer treatment and clinical trials, and is therefore relevant to the field of chemotherapy.\n2. p - p is the probability of improving from < VGPR before consolidation therapy to > VGPR after consolidation therapy.
