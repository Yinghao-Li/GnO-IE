Anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death, which is a natural process that occurs in cells throughout the body. However, abnormal regulation of apoptosis can lead to various diseases, such as cancer.\n* Pro-apoptotic proteins are proteins that promote apoptosis, and their upregulation can lead to increased cell death, which can be beneficial in certain contexts, such as in cancer treatment.\n* Anti-apoptotic proteins, on the other hand, inhibit apoptosis and prevent cell death. Downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins can lead to increased cell death, which can be beneficial in certain contexts, such as in cancer treatment.\n\nTherefore, all three entities - apoptosis, pro-apoptotic protein, and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 - are related to disease, either directly or indirectly."},
