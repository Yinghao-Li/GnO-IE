Early postoperative delirium is a medical condition that affects patients after surgery, characterized by a sudden change in mental status, causing confusion, disorientation, and altered level of consciousness. It is a serious complication that can lead to prolonged hospital stay, increased risk of falls, and long-term cognitive impairment.\n2. Confusion assessment method for the ICU scale is a tool used to evaluate the level of confusion and delirium in critically ill patients. It is a validated clinical tool that helps healthcare professionals identify patients who are at risk of developing delirium or are already experiencing delirium.\n\nTherefore, both early postoperative delirium and confusion assessment method for the ICU scale are \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},
