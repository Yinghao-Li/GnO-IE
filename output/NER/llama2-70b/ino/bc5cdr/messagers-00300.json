Subependymal hemorrhage is a condition where bleeding occurs in the area surrounding the ventricles in the brain. It is a type of brain bleed that can occur in newborns, and it has been linked to prenatal cocaine exposure.\n2. Cysts are abnormal fluid-filled sacs that can form in the brain. In this context, they are formed as a result of prenatal cocaine exposure and are detectable on cranial sonography in neonates born at term.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are subependymal hemorrhage and cysts."},
