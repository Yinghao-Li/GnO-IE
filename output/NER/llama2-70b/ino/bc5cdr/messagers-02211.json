Stalk effect (anatomically or functionally inhibited dopaminergic tonus)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Hyperprolactinemia is a condition where the level of prolactin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, is elevated. It is a disease entity because it is a abnormal condition that can have various causes and can affect the body's normal functioning.\n2. Verapamil unresponsiveness refers to a condition where the drug verapamil, which is used to lower blood pressure, does not have the expected response in a patient. This can be a disease entity because it may indicate an underlying abnormality in the patient's physiology that affects the drug's efficacy.\n3. Stalk effect, also known as anatomically or functionally inhibited dopaminergic tonus, refers to a condition where the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain are not functioning properly, leading to various symptoms such as hyperprolactinemia. This is a disease entity because it is a specific abnormality in the brain's neurotransmitter system that can have a significant impact on the body's normal functioning."},
