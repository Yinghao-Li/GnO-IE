Antiinfective group of drugs is a category of medications that are used to treat infections. It is not a specific disease, but rather a class of drugs that are used to treat a variety of infections.\n2. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is a specific antibiotic that belongs to the antiinfective group of drugs. It is used to treat bacterial infections, such as respiratory, urinary tract, and skin infections.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the antiinfective group of drugs and amoxicillin-clavulanate, which are both related to the treatment of infections."},
