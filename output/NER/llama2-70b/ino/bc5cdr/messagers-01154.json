Cardiac myocytes - Cardiac myocytes are cells that make up the muscle tissue of the heart. Damage to these cells can lead to various cardiovascular diseases.\n3. Antioxidant defense system - The antioxidant defense system is a network of enzymes, vitamins, and other molecules that protect cells from oxidative damage. A poor antioxidant defense system can increase the susceptibility of cells to oxidative stress and damage.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are ROS, cardiac myocytes, and the antioxidant defense system."},
