Stress-induced lethality\n3. Death without external stress\n\nThese three entities can be classified as diseases or disorders because they are abnormal conditions that affect the health or well-being of the animals being studied. Clonic seizure induction and stress-induced lethality are both potentially harmful conditions that can cause harm to the animals, while death without external stress is a condition that can result in the death of the animal.\n\nThe other two entities mentioned in the paragraph, locomotor activity and righting ability, are not diseases or disorders. Locomotor activity refers to the ability of an animal to move around, and righting ability refers to the ability of an animal to orient itself in space and maintain its balance. While these phenotypic characteristics may be affected by certain diseases or disorders, they are not themselves diseases or disorders."},
