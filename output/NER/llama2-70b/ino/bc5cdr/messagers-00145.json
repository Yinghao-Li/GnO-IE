Oliguria refers to a decrease in urine production, which can be a sign of kidney dysfunction or failure.\n2. Abdominal pain can be a symptom of various conditions, including kidney stones or other kidney problems.\n3. Renal failure refers to the inability of the kidneys to function properly, which can lead to the accumulation of waste products in the body.\n4. Radiolucent renal calculi are small, soft, and radiolucent (able to be seen through by X-rays) stones that form in the kidneys.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are all related to kidney problems and dysfunction."},
