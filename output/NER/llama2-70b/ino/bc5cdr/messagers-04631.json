MMQ cells implantation\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Hyperprolactinemia is a condition where there is an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood.\n2. Haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of the drug haloperidol, which can cause an increase in prolactin levels.\n3. Serum PRL levels increase refers to an increase in the levels of prolactin in the blood.\n4. MMQ cells implantation is a medical procedure where cells are implanted under the kidney capsule, which can cause an increase in prolactin production and secretion.\n\nTherefore, all the above entities can be considered as \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},

Haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of the drug haloperidol, which can cause an increase in prolactin levels, and is therefore a disease.\n\nThe other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"serum PRL levels increase\" and \"MMQ cells implantation\", are not directly referring to a disease, but rather to a symptom or a medical procedure that may be related to a disease.

Haloperidol is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat various conditions such as schizophrenia, anxiety, and nausea.\n2. Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone that is produced by the pituitary gland and plays a role in lactation and other physiological processes.\n3. MMQ cells are not a chemical entity, but rather a cell type. However, since they are being used in the context of a chemical experiment, they can be considered as a chemical entity in this context. MMQ cells are a type of mouse mammary tumor cells that are often used in research to study the effects of hormones and growth factors on cell growth and differentiation.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the given paragraph are Haloperidol, Prolactin (PRL), and MMQ cells."},
