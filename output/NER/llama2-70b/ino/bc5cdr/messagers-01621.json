Identify the mention of a biological process or condition that is not normal or healthy.\n2. Determine if the mentioned process or condition is a disease or a symptom of a disease.\n\nApplying these steps to the given paragraph, we can identify the following \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. CYP-induced cystitis\n2. Intermediate and chronic CYP-induced cystitis\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* CYP-induced cystitis\n* Intermediate CYP-induced cystitis\n* Chronic CYP-induced cystitis"},

Chronic CYP-induced cystitis\n\nThe mention of \"intermediate\" is not specific enough to be considered a disease entity, as it could refer to a stage or severity of the disease rather than the disease itself.

CYP - cytochrome P450, a family of enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of drugs and other foreign compounds in the body.\n5. cystitis - inflammation of the urinary bladder, which can be caused by various factors, including infection or irritation.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\n* mRNA\n* p75 (NTR) protein\n* CYP enzymes\n* cystitis (a condition caused by chemical changes in the body)"},
