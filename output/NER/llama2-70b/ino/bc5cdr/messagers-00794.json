    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Visual field defect\n2. Monocular mean radial degrees (MRDs)\n3. I / 4e isopter on Goldmann perimetry\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Visual field defect: This is a disease or condition that affects the visual field, which is the area that can be seen by an eye at a particular time.\n2. Monocular mean radial degrees (MRDs): This is a measure of the extent of the visual field defect, specifically the average degree of deviation of the visual field from the center of the visual field.\n3. I / 4e isopter on Goldmann perimetry: This is a type of perimetry, which is a test used to measure the visual field. The I / 4e isopter is a specific type of perimetry that uses a specific stimulus size and intensity to assess the visual field.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the visual field defect and the measures used to assess it, including MRDs and I / 4e isopter on Goldmann perimetry."},
