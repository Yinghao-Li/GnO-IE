Sulfomethoxazole\n\nThese two compounds are both medications, specifically antibiotics. Trimethoprim is a synthetic antibiotic that belongs to the class of folic acid inhibitors, while sulfomethoxazole is a sulfonamide antibiotic. When used together, they form a combination drug known as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is often abbreviated as TMP-SMX. This drug is commonly used to treat bacterial infections, but it can cause adverse reactions, including hemolytic anemia, in some individuals."},
