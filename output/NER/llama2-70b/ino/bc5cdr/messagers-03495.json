Histamine is a chemical messenger released by immune cells, including mast cells and basophils, in response to allergens or other stimuli.\n2. H1 receptors are a type of histamine receptor that is found on the surface of many cell types, including those in the brain.\n3. Pertussis toxin is a highly toxic protein produced by Bordetella pertussis, the bacteria that cause whooping cough. It is a major component of the pertussis vaccine.\n4. Immunization is the process of introducing a substance (such as a vaccine) into the body to stimulate an immune response.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
