Sinus rhythm: A normal heart rhythm originating from the sinus node, which is the natural pacemaker of the heart.\n2. S-A block: A type of heart block, also known as a conduction disorder, where there is a delay or blockage in the electrical impulses that travel from the sinus node to the atrioventricular (AV) node. This can cause an abnormal heart rhythm."},
