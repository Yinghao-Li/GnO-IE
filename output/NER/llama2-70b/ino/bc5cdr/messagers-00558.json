Mucosal mastocytosis\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Indomethacin is a chemical compound, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to treat pain, inflammation, and fever.\n2. Histopathologic findings refer to the results of examining tissue samples under a microscope for abnormalities or disease.\n3. Interstitial cystitis is a chronic bladder condition characterized by recurring discomfort or pain in the bladder and pelvic area.\n4. Leaky bladder epithelium refers to the thin layer of cells that line the bladder and urinary tract, which can become damaged or permeable, allowing toxins to pass through and cause irritation.\n5. Mucosal mastocytosis is a condition where mast cells, a type of immune system cell, accumulate in the mucous membranes, leading to inflammation and tissue damage."},
