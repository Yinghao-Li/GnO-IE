Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is \"liver graft recipients\" and their postoperative recovery.\n2. Identify the complications or health issues related to the main topic: The paragraph mentions two complications or health issues related to liver graft recipients:\na. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II\nb. Postoperative recovery of platelet count\n3. Identify the \"Disease\" entities: Based on the above analysis, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\na. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II\nb. Thrombocytopenia (as a consequence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II\n2. Thrombocytopenia"},
