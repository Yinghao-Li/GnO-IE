Melphalan (a chemotherapy drug)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* ARI is a disease entity because it is a medical condition that affects the respiratory system and can be caused by various factors, including chemotherapy.\n* Melphalan is not a disease entity in this context, but rather a medication that is used to treat cancer. However, it is mentioned in the paragraph as a potential cause of ARI, so it is relevant to the discussion of disease entities."},
