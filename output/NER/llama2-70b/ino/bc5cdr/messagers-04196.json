Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism\n\nThis is a condition where there is a decrease in the production of the hormone aldosterone, which is produced by the adrenal glands. It is characterized by low levels of aldosterone and renin, another hormone produced by the kidneys. This condition can cause symptoms such as low blood pressure, weakness, and dehydration."},
