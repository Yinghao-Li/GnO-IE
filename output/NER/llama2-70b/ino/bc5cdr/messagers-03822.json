Metabolic changes\n\nThe phrase \"myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes\" refers to changes in the functioning and metabolism of the myocardium (heart muscle) that are not normal or healthy. These changes are induced by the presence of barium, which is a substance that can affect the heart's functioning. The phrase \"irrespective of the anesthetic employed\" means that the changes occur regardless of the type of anesthetic used.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the abnormal changes in the heart muscle's functioning and metabolism that are caused by the presence of barium."},
