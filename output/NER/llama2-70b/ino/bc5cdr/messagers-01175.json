It is a disease or condition that affects the heart's electrical activity.\n* Torsades de pointes (Tdp) is a specific type of ventricular fibrillation that can occur in patients with QT prolongation. It is also a disease or condition that affects the heart's electrical activity.\n\nTherefore, both QT prolongation and Tdp are \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},
