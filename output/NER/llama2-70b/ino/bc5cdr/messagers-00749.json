It is a term used to describe a dummy treatment or a substance that has no active therapeutic effects, but is administered to a patient to mimic the real treatment in order to gauge the body's natural healing process or to assess the psychological effects of treatment.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Isradipine."},
