Carrying the HBsAg in one's blood indicates that the person is infected with HBV, which can lead to hepatitis B disease.\n2. Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and can cause inflammation, scarring, and cirrhosis. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).\n\nTherefore, both HBsAg and hepatitis B can be classified as \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},
