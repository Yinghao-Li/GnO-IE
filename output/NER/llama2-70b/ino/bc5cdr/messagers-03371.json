CI (confidence intervals)\n4. LT (lifetime exposure days)\n5. IW (intensity-weighted lifetime exposure days)\n\nThese entities are all related to statistical analysis and risk assessment in the context of chemical exposure. Poisson regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, and it is commonly used in epidemiology to study the association between chemical exposure and health outcomes. Adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CI) are statistical measures that are derived from Poisson regression and are used to quantify the strength and uncertainty of the association between exposure and outcome. Lifetime exposure days (LT) and intensity-weighted lifetime exposure days (IW) are measures of chemical exposure that take into account the duration and intensity of exposure, respectively.\n\nI hope this helps!
