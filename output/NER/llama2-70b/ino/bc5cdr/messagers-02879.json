Histopathological findings\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Drug-induced baboon syndrome is a disease caused by an adverse reaction to a drug, in this case, ketoconazole.\n2. Sensitivity to topical ketoconazole is a pre-existing condition that may have contributed to the development of the drug-induced baboon syndrome.\n3. Histopathological findings refer to the results of a histopathological examination, which is a diagnostic test used to identify diseases or conditions by examining tissue samples under a microscope. In this case, the histopathological findings may have helped to confirm the diagnosis of drug-induced baboon syndrome."},
