RD is a chemical entity as it represents a measure of the duration of response to a treatment or therapy.\n2. p is a chemical entity as it represents a probability value, which is a measure of the likelihood of a particular event or outcome occurring. In this case, p < 0.001 indicates that the difference in median duration of response between patients who received RD until progression and those who did not is statistically significant."},
