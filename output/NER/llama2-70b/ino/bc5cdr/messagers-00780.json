Cardiotoxic drugs are medications that can damage the heart and are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n3. Fluorouracil, anthracyclines, and gemcitabine (GEM) are all chemotherapy drugs that are known to have cardiotoxic effects and can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the adverse effects on the cardiovascular system (VNR cardiac events) and the drugs that can cause these effects (fluorouracil, anthracyclines, and gemcitabine)."},
