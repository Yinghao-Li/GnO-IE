This can be caused by certain chemicals or drugs that affect the cardiac ion channels and disrupt the normal heart rhythm.\n\nTherefore, while there are no direct mentions of chemical entities in the paragraph, the concept of \"QT prolongation\" implies the presence of chemicals or drugs that can affect the cardiac ion channels and potentially cause this condition."},
