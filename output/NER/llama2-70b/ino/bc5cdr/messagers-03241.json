The paragraph only mentions two medical conditions, \"increased intraocular pressure\" and \"cataract formation,\" which are not chemical entities.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. \"Adverse events\" - This is not a chemical entity, but rather a term used to describe negative effects or side effects that occur as a result of a medical treatment or intervention.\n2. \"included\" - This is not a chemical entity, but rather a word used to indicate that a list of items is being provided.\n3. \"increased intraocular pressure\" - This is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition that refers to a build-up of pressure inside the eye.\n4. \"and\" - This is not a chemical entity, but rather a conjunction used to connect two items in a list.\n5. \"cataract formation\" - This is not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition that refers to the clouding of the lens in the eye.\n\nTherefore, there are no chemical entities in the given paragraph."},
