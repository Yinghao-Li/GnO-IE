Glomerulosclerosis index (GSI) is a measure of the degree of glomerular scarring in the kidneys, and it is a chemical entity as it is a quantitative measure of a biological process.\n2. 6.21%, 25.35%, and 30.49% are all chemical concentrations or proportions, and they are expressed as percentages, which are chemical entities."},
