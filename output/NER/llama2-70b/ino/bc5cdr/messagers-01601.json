Fluoxetine\n\nBranch retinal vein occlusion is a medical condition that affects the eyes and can cause vision loss or blindness. Fluoxetine, on the other hand, is a medication that is used to treat various conditions such as depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is not a disease entity in itself, but it can be associated with certain side effects or adverse reactions that can be considered diseases. Therefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Branch retinal vein occlusion\n2. Depression (or other conditions that fluoxetine is used to treat)"},
