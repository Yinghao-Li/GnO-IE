Drug hypersensitivity\n\nThese are the disease entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Myocarditis: This is a type of inflammation that affects the heart muscle (myocardium).\n2. Hypersensitivity: This refers to an exaggerated response to a substance or stimulus, which can cause an allergic reaction.\n3. Fulminant eosinophilic myocarditis: This is a severe and sudden inflammation of the heart muscle, characterized by the presence of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell.\n4. Drug hypersensitivity: This refers to an adverse reaction to a drug, which can cause a range of symptoms, including hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nI hope this helps!
