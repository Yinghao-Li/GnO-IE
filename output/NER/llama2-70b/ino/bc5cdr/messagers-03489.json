Hematologic features: This refers to the changes in the blood and blood cells that can be observed in response to a disease or condition.\n2. Biochemical features: This refers to the changes in the levels of various biochemical substances in the body that can be measured through laboratory tests, such as enzymes, hormones, or metabolites.\n3. Pathologic features: This refers to the changes in the structure and function of organs or tissues that can be observed through pathological examination, such as histopathology or cytopathology.\n4. Mixed hepatocellular damage: This refers to the damage to liver cells (hepatocytes) that can result from various causes, such as drug hypersensitivity, viral hepatitis, or alcohol abuse.\n5. Drug hypersensitivity: This refers to an exaggerated response to a drug, which can cause damage to various organs, including the liver.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Mixed hepatocellular damage\n* Drug hypersensitivity"},
