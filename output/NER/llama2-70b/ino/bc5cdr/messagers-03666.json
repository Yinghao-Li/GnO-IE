Imipramine is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to control behavior disorders. It is a type of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and is composed of a benzene ring with three alkyl groups attached to it.\n2. Blood pressure is a physiological parameter that is measured in units of millimeters of mercury (mmHg). In this paragraph, the blood pressure of the patient is reported as 190/160 mmHg, which is considered severe hypertension.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Imipramine and blood pressure (190/160 mmHg)."},
