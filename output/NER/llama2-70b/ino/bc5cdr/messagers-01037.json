Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is \"Growth-associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide.\"\n2. Identify the keywords related to disease: The keywords related to disease in this paragraph are \"chronic epileptic rats.\"\n3. Identify the entities: The entities in this paragraph are \"chronic epilepsy\" and \"rats.\"\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Chronic epilepsy\n2. Rats (as they are mentioned in the context of chronic epilepsy)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"chronic epilepsy\" and \"rats\" (as they are associated with chronic epilepsy)."},
