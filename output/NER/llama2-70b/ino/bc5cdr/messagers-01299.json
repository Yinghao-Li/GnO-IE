Prox-1 is a protein that is used as a marker for hilar neurons. It is a chemical entity because it is a molecule that has a specific structure and function.\n2. Granule is a type of cell that is found in the brain. It is a chemical entity because it is a collection of molecules that work together to perform a specific function.\n3. Cell is a general term for a unit of life. It is a chemical entity because it is made up of various molecules, such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids, that work together to perform cellular functions.\n4. Optical fractionator method is a technique used to estimate the number of cells in a given sample. It is a chemical entity because it involves the use of chemicals and chemical reactions to prepare the sample for analysis."},
