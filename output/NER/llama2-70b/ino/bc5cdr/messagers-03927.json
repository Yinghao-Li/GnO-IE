Severe autonomic dysfunction\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Idiopathic orthostatic hypotension is a disease entity because it is a medical condition that is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up, and its cause is not known.\n* Severe autonomic dysfunction is also a disease entity because it is a medical condition that affects the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions of the body, such as heart rate and blood pressure. In this case, it is mentioned as a component of the idiopathic orthostatic hypotension."},
