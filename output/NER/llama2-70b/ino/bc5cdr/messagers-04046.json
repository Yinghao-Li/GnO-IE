Doxorubicin - Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer.\n2. Myocardial scintigraphy - Myocardial scintigraphy is a diagnostic test used to image the heart muscle and detect any abnormalities in its function.\n3. Heptadecanoic acid (I-131 HA) - Heptadecanoic acid is a radioactive tracer used in myocardial scintigraphy to visualize the heart muscle.\n4. Left-ventricular function - Left-ventricular function refers to the ability of the left ventricle of the heart to pump blood effectively.\n5. Mongrel dogs - Mongrel dogs are dogs of mixed breed or uncertain ancestry, which are often used in scientific research.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cancer (mentioned as the condition that doxorubicin is used to treat)\n2. Myocardial scintigraphy (a diagnostic test used to detect abnormalities in the heart muscle)\n3. Left-ventricular function (a measure of the heart's ability to pump blood effectively)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
