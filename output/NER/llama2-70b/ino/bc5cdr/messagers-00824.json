Gliosis is a type of scarring that occurs in the brain or spinal cord, often as a result of injury or disease.\n3. Neuronal damage refers to damage or injury to neurons, which can lead to various neurological disorders.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hypertrophy\n* Gliosis\n* Neuronal damage"},
