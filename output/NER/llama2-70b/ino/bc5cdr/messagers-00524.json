Cardiomyopathy\n\nThese three entities can be classified as diseases because they are all harmful conditions that affect the body. Cardiac tissue damage and cardiomyopathy are both conditions that affect the heart, while mitochondrial dysfunction is a condition that affects the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures within cells. All three conditions can have negative impacts on the body's functioning and can cause harm to the patient."},
