Antibiotic therapy refers to the use of chemical substances (antibiotics) to treat bacterial infections.\n2. Acute kidney injury is a medical condition where the kidneys suddenly stop functioning properly, leading to a buildup of waste products in the blood. While it is not a chemical entity in the classical sense, it is a clinical condition that can be caused by various chemical factors, such as certain medications, toxins, or severe dehydration.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are the antibiotics used in antibiotic therapy and the chemical substances that can cause acute kidney injury."},
