D-tubocurarine: This is a chemical compound used as a muscle relaxant in surgical anesthesia. It is the active ingredient being studied in the paragraph.\n2. Histamine: This is a chemical messenger released by the body's immune system during an allergic reaction. It is mentioned in the paragraph as a potential side effect of the bolus injection of D-tubocurarine.\n3. mg/kg: This is a unit of measurement used to express the dose of D-tubocurarine in terms of milligrams per kilogram of body weight. It is not a chemical entity itself, but rather a way of expressing the amount of the chemical compound being used.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* D-tubocurarine\n* Histamine\n\nI hope this helps!
