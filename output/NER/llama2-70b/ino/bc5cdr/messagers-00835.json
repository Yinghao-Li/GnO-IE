Amiodarone is a disease entity because it is a drug that can cause toxic effects on the liver.\n2. Hepatic lipid homeostasis is a disease entity because it is a physiological process that is disrupted by the toxic effect of amiodarone.\n3. PPARalpha target genes are disease entities because they are genes that are affected by the toxic effect of amiodarone and are involved in the development of liver disease."},
