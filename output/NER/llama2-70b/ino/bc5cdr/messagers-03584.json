Catecholamines - This is a class of chemicals that includes dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.\n2. Dopamine - This is a specific catecholamine that is produced in the brain and plays a role in mood regulation, motivation, and other physiological processes.\n3. Norepinephrine - This is a specific catecholamine that is produced in the brain and plays a role in the \"fight or flight\" response, as well as other physiological processes.\n4. Epinephrine - This is a specific catecholamine that is produced in the adrenal glands and plays a role in the \"fight or flight\" response, as well as other physiological processes.\n\nI hope this helps!
