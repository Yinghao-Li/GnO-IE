Denervation is a disease or condition where the nerves of a particular area or organ are damaged or removed. In this paragraph, the dogs' hearts had been denervated by a procedure, indicating that they had a disease or condition that affected their nervous system.\n2. Cardiovascular systems refer to the heart and blood vessels, which are vital organs that work together to circulate blood throughout the body. The paragraph mentions that the drugs were tested on dogs whose hearts had been denervated, indicating that the dogs had a condition that affected their cardiovascular systems."},
