    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ischaemic coronary arteriosclerosis\n2. Hyperglyceridemic effect\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Ischaemic coronary arteriosclerosis is a disease characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, leading to a reduction in blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart.\n2. Hyperglyceridemic effect refers to the increase in blood levels of glycerol and fatty acids, which can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are Ischaemic coronary arteriosclerosis and hyperglyceridemic effect."},
