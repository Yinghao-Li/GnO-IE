LT (Lung Tissue) - Not a chemical entity, it's a medical term referring to lung tissue.\n2. Diazinon - A chemical entity, it's a pesticide used in agriculture and gardening.\n3. RR (Relative Risk) - Not a chemical entity, it's a statistical measure used to quantify the strength of the association between a risk factor and an outcome.\n4. CI (Confidence Interval) - Not a chemical entity, it's a statistical measure that indicates the range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie.\n5.
