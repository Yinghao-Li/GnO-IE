Tubular damage\n\nThis entity clearly refers to a type of kidney damage, which is a disease. Therefore, it is a relevant entity.\n\nThe other entity mentioned in the paragraph, \"lipid peroxidation,\" is not a disease entity. It is a chemical process that can contribute to the development of various diseases, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, it should be removed from the list of disease entities.\n\nSo, the final list of disease entities in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Tubular damage"},
