ATIN (Acute Tubular Injury/Necrosis)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Acute Tubular Injury (ATI) refers to damage to the tubules in the kidney that can lead to inflammation and cell death.\n* Necrosis refers to the death of cells or tissues, which can occur due to various factors such as injury, infection, or toxins.\n* ATIN is a combination of ATI and necrosis, indicating that there is both inflammation and cell death in the tubules of the kidney.\n\nTherefore, ATIN is a disease entity that describes a type of kidney damage characterized by inflammation and cell death in the tubules."},
