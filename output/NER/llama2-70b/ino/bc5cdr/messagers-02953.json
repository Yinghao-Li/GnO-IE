Secondary pinprick hyperalgesia is a condition where a person experiences increased sensitivity to pain after a initial painful stimulus. In this paragraph, it is mentioned as a response to capsaicin.\n2. Von Frey gauges are a tool used to measure tactile sensitivity, specifically used to assess touch perception and pain sensitivity. They are used to detect secondary pinprick hyperalgesia in this context.\n\nTherefore, both secondary pinprick hyperalgesia and von Frey gauges are related to the concept of disease or medical condition in the paragraph."},

Secondary pinprick hyperalgesia\n\nThis condition is mentioned as a response to capsaicin and is therefore relevant to the concept of disease.\n\nI have removed von Frey gauges from the list as they are not directly related to disease, but rather a tool used to measure tactile sensitivity and pain sensitivity."},

Capsaicin\n\nCapsaicin is a chemical compound that is responsible for the spicy taste of chili peppers. It is a capsaicinoid, a class of compounds found in the placental tissue of chili peppers.\n\n2. Von Frey gauges\n\nVon Frey gauges are not chemical entities, but rather a tool used to measure tactile sensitivity. They are a series of small, flexible filaments that are applied to the skin to test for sensitivity to touch and pressure.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is capsaicin."},
