Medications: The paragraph mentions \"medications\" as the cause of the changes being described. Medications are chemical substances that are designed to interact with biological systems and have a therapeutic effect. Therefore, they can be considered chemical entities.\n2. Base-line levels: The paragraph mentions \"base-line levels\" as a reference point for comparison. Base-line levels refer to the normal or standard levels of a physiological or biochemical parameter in the absence of any external influences. In this context, base-line levels can be considered a chemical entity because it represents a specific concentration or amount of a substance in the body."},
