Hemoglobinuria\n\nExplanation:\n\nHemoglobinuria is a condition where the urine contains an abnormal amount of hemoglobin, which is a protein in red blood cells. In this paragraph, the patient developed hemoglobinuria during red cell transfusion, indicating that the transfusion caused the patient's body to produce excess hemoglobin in their urine.
