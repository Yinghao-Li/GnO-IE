Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The main topic of the paragraph is the evaluation of animals for certain behaviors or conditions.\n2. Identify the specific conditions or behaviors being evaluated: The paragraph mentions the following conditions or behaviors:\n * Parkinsonian disability\n * Dyskinesia\n * Motor fluctuations\n * Neuropsychiatric-like behaviors\n3. Determine which of these conditions or behaviors can be considered \"diseases\":\n * Parkinsonian disability: Yes, this can be considered a disease.\n * Dyskinesia: Yes, this can be considered a disease.\n * Motor fluctuations: No, this is not a disease, but rather a symptom or a condition that can be associated with certain diseases.\n * Neuropsychiatric-like behaviors: No, this is not a disease, but rather a group of behaviors that can be associated with certain diseases or conditions.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Parkinsonian disability\n2. Dyskinesia"},
