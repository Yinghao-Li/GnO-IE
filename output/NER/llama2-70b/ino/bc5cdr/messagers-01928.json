Chest pain is a symptom that can be indicative of a disease or medical condition, and in this context, it is associated with cocaine use.\n2. Cocaine association refers to the patient's history of using cocaine, which is a known risk factor for various medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease.\n3. Low-risk patients refer to individuals who do not have any significant medical history or risk factors that would make them high-risk for coronary artery disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are chest pain, cocaine association, and low-risk patients."},
