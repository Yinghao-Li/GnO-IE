Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. It is the primary disease being studied in the paragraph.\n2. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a standardized clinical rating scale used to assess the severity of Parkinson's disease. It is mentioned in the paragraph as the tool used to evaluate the patients' motor examination scores and activities of daily living scores.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)."},
