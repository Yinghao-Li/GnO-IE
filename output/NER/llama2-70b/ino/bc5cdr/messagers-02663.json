TAP: TAP stands for \"Tumor Adenocarcinoma Pulmonar,\" which is a type of lung cancer. It is a disease entity.\n3. DNA SBs: DNA SBs stands for \"DNA single-strand breaks,\" which is a type of DNA damage that can lead to genetic mutations and diseases. It is a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Necrosis\n2. TAP\n3. DNA SBs"},

Let's identify the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph step by step:\n\n1. \"cumulative dose\" - This refers to the total amount of a chemical substance administered over a period of time. Therefore, \"cumulative dose\" is not a chemical entity.\n2. \"body weight\" - This is a physical parameter and not a chemical entity.\n3. \"necrosis\" - This is a pathological condition and not a chemical entity.\n4. \"TAP\" - This is an abbreviation that could refer to several things, but without additional context, it is difficult to determine if it represents a chemical entity. Let's assume it is not a chemical entity for now.\n5. \"DNA SBs\" - \"DNA SBs\" stands for \"DNA single-strand breaks.\" This is a type of DNA damage that can be caused by various chemicals, but \"DNA SBs\" itself is not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, there are no chemical entities in the paragraph."},
