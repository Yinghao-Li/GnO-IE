Anticoagulants are chemical substances that prevent the formation of blood clots or inhibit the activity of clotting factors. They are commonly used to treat conditions such as deep vein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, and stroke prevention.\n2. Bleeding diatheses refers to a group of medical conditions that affect the body's ability to form blood clots and stop bleeding. Examples of bleeding diatheses include hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, and platelet disorders.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are anticoagulants and bleeding diatheses."},
