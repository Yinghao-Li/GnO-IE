In this case, it is describing the proportion of individuals who have serum creatinine levels above normal, which implies that it is referring to a disease or condition that is characterized by high serum creatinine levels. Therefore, \"serum creatinine levels > 50 % above normal\" can be considered a disease entity in this context."},

Creatinine is a chemical compound that is produced by the body and is used as a marker of kidney function. It is a chemical entity because it is a specific substance with a defined chemical structure.\n2. Serum is the liquid portion of blood that separates from the clot when blood coagulates. It is a chemical entity because it is a mixture of various chemical compounds, including proteins, lipids, and electrolytes.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are creatinine and serum."},
