Cardiomyopathic disorder is a disease that affects the heart muscle, myocardial metabolic disturbances refer to abnormalities in the metabolic processes of the heart muscle, and hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital is an abnormal response to a specific substance."},
