Tachycardia\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Tachycardia is a condition where the heart rate is abnormally fast, and it can be life-threatening.\n\nI removed \"arrhythmia\" from the list since it's a broader term that encompasses various types of abnormal heart rhythms, including tachycardia. In this paragraph, \"tachycardia\" is the specific condition being referred to, so it's the most relevant entity to include under the \"Disease\" category."},
