PHN is a term used to describe a type of neuropathic pain that can have various underlying causes, including chemical damage to the nerves.\n2. Trigeminal is an adjective referring to the trigeminal nerve, which is a nerve that carries sensation from the face and head to the brain. Trigeminal involvement in PHN refers to the presence of pain or sensory disturbance in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve.\n\nTherefore, both PHN and trigeminal are related to the chemical aspect of nerve function and damage, and can be considered \"Chemical\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},

The term \"chemical\" is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but it is implied in the concept of PHN.\n\nTherefore, the only entity that clearly refers to Chemical in the paragraph is PHN."},
