This can be caused by a blockage in the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart.\n2. Renal dysfunction - Renal dysfunction refers to impaired kidney function, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including damage to the kidneys or decreased blood flow to the kidneys.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Myocardial infarctions\n* Renal dysfunction"},
