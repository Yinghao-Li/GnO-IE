Gentamicin-induced nephritis\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Tubulointerstitial nephritis is a type of kidney disease characterized by inflammation in the tubules and interstitium of the kidney. It is often caused by drug toxicity, infections, or autoimmune disorders.\n2. Gentamicin-induced nephritis is a type of tubulointerstitial nephritis that is specifically caused by the antibiotic gentamicin. Gentamicin can cause damage to the kidney cells and lead to inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney tissue.\n\nTherefore, both tubulointerstitial nephritis and gentamicin-induced nephritis can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the sentence."},
