Isoprenaline: Isoprenaline is a medication used to treat various cardiovascular conditions, such as angina, hypertension, and heart failure. It works by increasing the heart's ability to contract and improving blood flow.\n2. Propranolol: Propranolol is a medication used to treat conditions such as hypertension, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders. It works by blocking the effects of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) on the heart.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Angina\n2. Hypertension\n3. Heart failure\n4.
