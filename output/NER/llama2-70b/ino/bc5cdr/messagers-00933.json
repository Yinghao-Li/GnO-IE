Injections: The paragraph mentions \"injections\" as a chemical entity because it refers to a substance (or substances) that is being introduced into the animals' bodies.\n2. Histological: This term refers to the study of tissues and their structure, which involves the use of chemicals and dyes to preserve and stain tissue samples for microscopic examination.\n3.
