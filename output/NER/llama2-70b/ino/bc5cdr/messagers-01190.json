Methadone is a chemical compound, specifically a synthetic opioid.\n2. QT interval is a measure of the time interval between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in an electrocardiogram (ECG). It is not a chemical entity, but rather a physiological measure that can be affected by chemical substances.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Methadone."},
