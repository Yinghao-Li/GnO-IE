GSH (glutathione) - a tripeptide that acts as an antioxidant in cells.\n4. TNFalpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) - a cytokine that promotes inflammation and cell death.\n5. MDA (malondialdehyde) - a product of lipid peroxidation, which is a process that damages cell membranes.\n6. Caspase-3 - a protein that plays a role in programmed cell death (apoptosis).\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* BCNU\n* GR\n* GSH\n* TNFalpha\n* MDA\n* Caspase-3"},
