Isoflurane group is not a disease, but it is a group of patients who were administered isoflurane, a anesthetic agent, during surgery. In the context of the paragraph, it is mentioned that the serum creatinine concentration returned postoperatively to the initial level in all groups except the isoflurane group, indicating that the isoflurane group had a different outcome than the other groups, which suggests that isoflurane may have had an effect on the patients' health. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity in this context."},
