Sodium and volume depletion\n\nThe paragraph mentions that indomethacin may diminish the blood pressure maintaining effect of the stimulated renin-angiotensin system in sodium and volume depletion. Sodium and volume depletion is a condition that can lead to a drop in blood pressure, and it is often associated with various diseases, such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Sodium and volume depletion"},

Renin - an enzyme that converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.\n4. Angiotensin - a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and stimulates the production of aldosterone, which increases sodium reabsorption in the kidneys.\n5.
