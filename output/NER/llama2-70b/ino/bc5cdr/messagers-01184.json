Iso: This is a chemical compound, specifically isoproterenol, which is a synthetic catecholamine that can stimulate β-adrenergic receptors.\n2. TGR: This is a genetically modified rat model that overexpresses the β-adrenergic receptor.\n3. SD: This is a reference to the Sprague-Dawley rat, which is a commonly used control animal model.\n4. LV: This is an abbreviation for left ventricle, which is a chamber of the heart.\n5. wt: This is an abbreviation for weight, specifically the weight of the left ventricle.\n6. body wt: This is an abbreviation for body weight.\n7. g: This is an abbreviation for grams, which is a unit of weight.\n8. 100 g: This is a unit of weight, representing 100 grams.\n9. /: This is a division symbol, indicating the ratio of LV weight to body weight.\n10. +/-, -: These are mathematical symbols indicating the standard error of the mean.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
