Cytologic perspective\n4. Mammographic perspective\n\nThese four entities are all related to the evaluation and diagnosis of diseases or medical conditions, specifically breast cancer, which is the focus of the paragraph. The clinical perspective refers to the patient's symptoms and medical history, the metabolic perspective refers to the patient's metabolic health, the cytologic perspective refers to the study of cells, and the mammographic perspective refers to the use of mammography to image the breast tissue.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Clinical perspective\n* Metabolic perspective\n* Cytologic perspective\n* Mammographic perspective"},

Mammographic perspective\n\nThe term \"mammographic\" refers to the use of mammography, a medical imaging technique, to evaluate the breast tissue. This suggests that the paragraph is discussing the evaluation and diagnosis of breast cancer, which is a disease. Therefore, \"Mammographic perspective\" can be considered a \"Disease\" entity."},

Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) - HRT refers to the use of hormones to replace those that the body is not producing or producing at lower levels. Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate various bodily functions.\n2. Progestative phase - Progestative refers to the use of progesterone, a hormone that helps prepare the uterus for pregnancy. Progesterone is a chemical substance that is used in hormone replacement therapy.\n3. Thermographic evaluation - Thermography is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses thermal cameras to detect and record temperature changes in the body.
