Malaria is a disease caused by a parasitic infection of the blood, which is confirmed by the laboratory examination showing the presence of Plasmodium falciparum.\n2. Jaundice is a condition characterized by a yellowish discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes, which is caused by an excess of bilirubin in the blood. The laboratory examination shows elevated levels of total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, and unconjugated bilirubin, indicating jaundice.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Malaria and Jaundice."},

Jaundice\n\nThe entities \"total bilirubin,\" \"conjugated bilirubin,\" and \"unconjugated bilirubin\" are not directly related to the disease entities, but rather are laboratory results that are used to diagnose and monitor the disease. Therefore, they are not included in the revised list.\n\nThe entity \"quinine infusion in dextrose 5% 500 mg/8 hour\" is a treatment for malaria, but it is not a disease entity.\n\nThe entity \"potassium 3.52 meq/L\" is a laboratory result that is not directly related to the disease entities, and therefore is not included in the revised list."},
