Tubular dysfunction\n\nThese three entities can be classified as diseases or disorders that affect the kidneys and their function. Proximal tubular damage and tubular dysfunction are both kidney damage disorders, while glomerular dysfunction refers to impaired functioning of the glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess fluids from the blood."},
