Seizures are a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n2. Loss of GFAP-staining refers to a decrease or absence of a protein called Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein in the brain tissue, which is indicative of a disease or injury.\n3. Oval focus refers to a specific area in the brain where the loss of GFAP-staining is observed.\n4. SNR (Subiculum-Nucleus rectus) is a brain structure that is affected by the loss of GFAP-staining."},
