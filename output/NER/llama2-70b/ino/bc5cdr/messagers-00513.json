Doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Mitochondrial cardiomyopathy is a disease that affects the heart muscle and is caused by dysfunctional mitochondria.\n* Doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy is a type of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy that is caused by the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. It is a side effect of cancer treatment and can lead to heart failure.\n\nTherefore, both \"mitochondrial cardiomyopathy\" and \"doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy\" can be classified as \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},
