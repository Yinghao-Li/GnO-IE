Nephrotoxicity - This refers to the damage caused to the kidneys by a substance or agent. Nephrotoxicity is a condition where the kidneys are damaged or injured as a result of exposure to a toxic substance, and it can lead to kidney failure or other serious health problems.\n2. Amphotericin B - This is an antifungal drug that is used to treat fungal infections. It is also known to have nephrotoxic effects, meaning that it can damage the kidneys.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Nephrotoxicity\n2. Fungal infections (mentioned as the condition that Amphotericin B is used to treat)"},
