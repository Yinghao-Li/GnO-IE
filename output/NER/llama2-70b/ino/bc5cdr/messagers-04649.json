Cocaine dependence is a disease entity because it is a chronic condition characterized by a strong desire to use cocaine despite negative consequences.\n2. Mania is a disease entity because it is a mental disorder characterized by episodes of elevated or irritable mood, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness that can significantly impact an individual's daily life.\n\nIn this paragraph, the individual is described as having cocaine dependence and experiencing manic symptoms during the second week of taking the study drug diethylpropion. Therefore, both cocaine dependence and mania are relevant disease entities in this context."},
