Urethane anesthesia is also a disease state, as it is a form of anesthesia that can cause adverse effects on the body. Therefore, both cardiovascular function and urethane anesthesia can be classified as \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},

Clonidine is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat high blood pressure, anxiety, and other conditions. It is the substance being microinjected into the rats in the study described in the paragraph.\n2. Urethane is a chemical compound that is used as an anesthetic agent in animals.
