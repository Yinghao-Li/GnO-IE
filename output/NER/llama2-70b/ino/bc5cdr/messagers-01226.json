DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2) is a gene that has been associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and addiction.\n2. EPS (Extrapyramidal Symptoms) refers to a group of movement disorders that are associated with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and Huntington's disease.\n\nTherefore, both DRD2 and EPS can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},

Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder that causes progressive damage to the brain, leading to physical, cognitive, and psychiatric problems.\n\nBoth Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are clearly referred to as diseases in the paragraph, and therefore, they are the relevant entities that should be extracted."},
