Torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Dobutamine is a chemical substance, a medication used to treat certain heart conditions.\n2. QT prolongation is a measure of the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize, or recover, after each heartbeat. It is a chemical/physiological phenomenon that can be influenced by various factors, including medications.\n3. Torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that can be caused by certain medications, including dobutamine. It is a chemical/physiological phenomenon that can have serious consequences if left untreated.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
