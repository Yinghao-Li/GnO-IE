Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) - This is a medical imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. MRI does not contain any chemicals, so it is not a chemical entity.\n2. Computational brain-mapping techniques - This refers to a set of methods used to analyze and interpret brain imaging data. These techniques do not involve any chemicals, so they are not chemical entities.\n3. MA - This is an abbreviation for methamphetamine, which is a highly addictive and dangerous drug. Methamphetamine is a chemical substance, so it is a chemical entity in this paragraph.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Methamphetamine (MA)"},
