Acetaminophen\n\nAcetaminophen is a chemical compound, also known as paracetamol, which is a widely used pain reliever and fever reducer. It is the first chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n2. Organ support\n\nThe paragraph mentions the requirement for organ support in patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) due to acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (ALF). Organ support refers to the use of medical devices or therapies to support or replace the function of a failing organ, such as a ventilator for respiratory support or dialysis for renal support.\n\nTherefore, the two chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Acetaminophen\n2. Organ support (as a chemical entity, this refers to the various chemicals and devices used to support or replace organ function)"},
