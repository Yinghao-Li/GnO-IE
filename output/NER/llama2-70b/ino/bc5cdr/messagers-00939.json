Gentamicin-induced structural changes\n\nThe phrase \"functional changes\" is not specific enough to be considered a disease entity, as it could refer to any kind of functional change, not necessarily a disease. On the other hand, \"structural changes\" is more specific and clearly refers to changes in the physical structure of cells or tissues, which can be a characteristic of various diseases. Therefore, \"Gentamicin-induced structural changes\" is the only disease entity in the paragraph."},
