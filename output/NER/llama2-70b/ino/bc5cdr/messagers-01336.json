Toxic reaction in the retina\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Hydroxychloroquine is a medication used to treat various conditions such as malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.\n* Hydroxychloroquine toxicity refers to the harmful effects of the drug on the body, particularly the retina.\n* Retinal toxicity refers to the damage caused by the drug to the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.\n* Toxic reaction in the retina refers to the adverse response of the retina to the drug, which can cause damage to the retinal cells and lead to vision problems.\n\nTherefore, the three entities are related to the adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine on the retina."},
