It is a chemical entity as it is a measure of the effect of a chemical substance (the treatment) on a biological system (the tumor).\n2.

These strata are used to ensure that the study population is representative of the population of interest and to minimize bias in the results.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the given paragraph are ORR, Stratum 1, and Stratum 2."},
