Glucosuria\n\nThese three entities can be classified as diseases or disorders because they are abnormal conditions that affect the body's normal functioning. Hyperglycemia is a condition where the blood sugar level is too high, while glucosuria is the presence of glucose in the urine, which is a sign of abnormal glucose metabolism. An elevated glucose tolerance curve is also a sign of abnormal glucose metabolism, as it indicates that the body is not able to effectively regulate blood sugar levels."},
