Insulin\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Atypical antipsychotic agents are chemical substances used to treat schizophrenia.\n2. Glucose is a simple sugar that is an important source of energy for the body's cells. It is a chemical compound made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms.\n3. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells. It is a protein composed of 51 amino acid residues.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
