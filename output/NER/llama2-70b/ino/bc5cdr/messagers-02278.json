Neurologic toxicity is a disease or a condition that affects the nervous system and can cause a range of symptoms such as muscle weakness, numbness, and vision problems.\n2. Thiotepa (TSPA) is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat various types of cancer, including leukemia and lymphoma. It is administered intrathecally, meaning it is injected into the spinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the neurologic toxicity that occurred as a result of the administration of intrathecal combination chemotherapy including thiotepa."},
