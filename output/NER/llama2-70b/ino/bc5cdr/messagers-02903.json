Severe nelarabine neurotoxicity is a side effect of the chemotherapy drug nelarabine, which can cause damage to the nerves. This is considered a disease entity because it is a harmful condition that affects the patient's health.\n2. Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is a method of delivering chemotherapy drugs directly into the spinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This is also a disease entity because it is a medical treatment or procedure, rather than a natural part of the body."},

Nelarabine is a chemical drug used in chemotherapy.\n2. Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy refers to the administration of chemotherapy drugs directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding the brain and spinal cord. As the term \"chemotherapy\" implies the use of chemicals to treat cancer, \"intrathecal chemotherapy\" can also be considered a chemical entity in this context."},

Nelarabine is a chemical drug used in chemotherapy.\n\nThe term \"intrathecal\" refers to the method of administration, and \"chemotherapy\" is a broader term that encompasses various treatments, including those using chemicals. Therefore, \"intrathecal chemotherapy\" is not a specific chemical entity in this context."},
