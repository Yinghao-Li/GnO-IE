    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the following entities can be identified as \"Chemical\" entities:\n\n1. Contrast agent: The substance used for angiography, which is a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays to visualize the inside of blood vessels. The contrast agent is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but it is implied as the cause of the biphasic reaction and macro-papular rash in patient n degree 1 and the generalised sensation of heat and pain at the site of injection in patient n degree 2.\n2. Dyspnea: A symptom of a medical condition, which is a feeling of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. It is mentioned as part of the immediate reaction in patient n degree 1.\n3. Loss of consciousness: A symptom of a medical condition, which is a temporary loss of awareness and responsiveness. It is mentioned as part of the immediate reaction in patient n degree 1.\n4. Macro-papular rash: A type of skin rash that is characterized by large, flat, red patches on the skin. It is mentioned as part of the delayed reaction in patient n degree 1 and the generalised reaction in patient n degree 2.\n5. Pain: A symptom of a medical condition, which is a feeling of discomfort or distress. It is mentioned as part of the immediate reaction in patient n degree 2 and the generalised reaction in patient n degree 2.\n\nTherefore, the \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Contrast agent\n2. Dyspnea\n3. Loss of consciousness\n4. Macro-papular rash\n5. Pain"},
