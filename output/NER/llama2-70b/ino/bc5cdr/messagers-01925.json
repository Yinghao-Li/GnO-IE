Cocaine use is a disease or condition that affects the patient's health, specifically their cardiovascular system.\n3. Coronary computerized tomography angiography (CTA) is a diagnostic test used to evaluate the coronary arteries for blockages or stenosis, which can lead to cardiac events. It is not a disease entity itself, but it is related to the disease process and is used to help diagnose and manage cardiovascular disease."},
