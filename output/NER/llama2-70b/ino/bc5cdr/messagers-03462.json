Phenytoin\n\nThese are the two chemical compounds mentioned in the paragraph that clearly refer to chemical entities. The term \"disodium phosphate ester\" does not refer to a specific chemical compound, but rather describes a type of chemical modification that can be made to a compound. Therefore, it is not considered a chemical entity in this context."},
