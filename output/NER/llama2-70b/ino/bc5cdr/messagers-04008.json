Angina is a medical condition characterized by chest pain or discomfort due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It is a symptom of coronary artery disease.\n2. Sinoatrial (S-A) block is a type of heart block, which is a condition where the electrical impulses that control the heart's rhythm are blocked or delayed. In this case, the S-A block is intermittent, meaning it occurs occasionally or at irregular intervals.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are angina and intermittent sinoatrial block."},
