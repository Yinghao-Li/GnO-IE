Tumor: A tumor is an abnormal growth of cells that can be benign or malignant. In this paragraph, the dogs have tumors, which means they have an abnormal growth of cells that may or may not be cancerous.\n2. Cancer: Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. In this paragraph, the dogs have tumors, which suggests that they may have cancer. The use of chemotherapy drugs (CCNU and CTX) to treat the dogs further supports the possibility that they have cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Tumor and Cancer."},
