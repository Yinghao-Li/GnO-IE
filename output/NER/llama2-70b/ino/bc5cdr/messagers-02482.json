Cerebrospinal fluid\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Galactose is a sugar molecule, which is a chemical compound.\n* Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It is a complex mixture of various chemicals, including proteins, sugars, and other substances.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are galactose and cerebrospinal fluid."},
