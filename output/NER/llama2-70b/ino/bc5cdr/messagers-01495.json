Psychopathology refers to the study of mental disorders, including their diagnosis, classification, and treatment. In the context of the paragraph, the author is mentioning that there were no group differences in psychopathology, suggesting that the groups being compared did not have significant differences in mental health disorders.\n2. Fear recognition accuracy is a term used in psychology to describe the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to fearful stimuli. In the paragraph, the author is mentioning that the RC group exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups. This implies that the RC group had difficulty recognizing and responding to fearful stimuli, which could be a sign of a mental health disorder or impairment."},

Illicit substance use histories refer to the history of using drugs or other chemical substances that are illegal or prohibited. This includes substances that can alter brain function and behavior, and can have negative effects on mental and physical health.\n2. Fear recognition accuracy refers to the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to situations that trigger fear, which is a chemical response in the brain that triggers a fight-or-flight response. Impaired fear recognition accuracy can be a sign of altered brain function due to chemical substance use or other factors."},
