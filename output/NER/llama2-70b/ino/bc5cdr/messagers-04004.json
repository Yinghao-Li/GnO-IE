Cardiac hypertrophy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes enlarged, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including chemical changes in the body. Acute and chronic congestion refer to the accumulation of fluid and/or inflammatory cells in the lungs, liver, and other organs, which can be caused by chemical imbalances or reactions in the body."},
