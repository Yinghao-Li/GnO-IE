Mice (n = 12 for each point) - This refers to the experimental animals used in the study, which are not diseased.\n2. Physiological saline carrier - This is a solution used to dissolve and deliver drugs or other substances in the body. It is not a disease entity.\n3. Caffeine - Caffeine is a stimulant drug that can have various physiological effects, but it is not a disease entity in this context.\n4. Doses ranging from 125 - 500 mg/kg - This refers to the amount of caffeine administered to the mice, which is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the paragraph.
