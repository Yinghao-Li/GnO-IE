Hippocampus is a part of the brain that is affected by certain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, and epilepsy.\n2. Rats are the animals used in the study, which are treated with BCNU and ZnSO4.\n3. BCNU (1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea) is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat certain types of cancer, including brain tumors.\n4. ZnSO4 (zinc sulfate) is a compound that is used as a counterion in the study to improve the histological features in the hippocampus of rats treated with BCNU.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the hippocampus, rats, BCNU, and ZnSO4, as they are all related to the study of improving histological features in the hippocampus of rats treated with BCNU."},

BCNU (1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea) is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat certain types of cancer, including brain tumors. It is a disease-modifying agent that works by killing cancer cells or slowing their growth.\n2. ZnSO4 (zinc sulfate) is a compound that is used as a counterion in the study to improve the histological features in the hippocampus of rats treated with BCNU. It has no direct relation to disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are BCNU and ZnSO4, as they are both related to the treatment or modification of disease, specifically cancer."},
