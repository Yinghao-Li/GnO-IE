Neurotoxicity\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Posterior leukoencephalopathy is a disease that affects the brain, specifically the posterior part of the brain.\n2. Calcineurin-inhibitor-related neurotoxicity is a disease that is caused by the use of immunosuppressive agents, primarily those administered after a liver or kidney transplant.\n3. Neurotoxicity is a disease that refers to the damage caused to the brain and nervous system by the use of certain substances, in this case, immunosuppressive agents."},

Calcineurin inhibitor is a chemical compound that inhibits the activity of calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal function and survival.\n2. Immunosuppressive agents are a class of drugs that suppress the immune system's activity, which is necessary to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. These drugs can have side effects, including neurotoxicity, which can lead to posterior leukoencephalopathy."},
