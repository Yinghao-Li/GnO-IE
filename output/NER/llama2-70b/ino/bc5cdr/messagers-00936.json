Gentamicin is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is not a disease entity in itself, but it is mentioned in the paragraph as a treatment.\n2. Increase in plasma creatinine levels is a potential side effect of gentamicin treatment. It is a disease entity because it is an abnormality in the body's functioning that can indicate kidney damage or impairment."},

It is the only chemical entity in the paragraph that clearly refers to a chemical substance. Creatinine, on the other hand, is a naturally occurring compound in the body and not a chemical substance in the classical sense. Therefore, the only chemical entity in the paragraph is Gentamicin."},
