Nephropathy (a disease of the kidneys)\n2. Proteinuria (excess protein in the urine, which could be a symptom of various kidney diseases)\n3. Glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys, which can cause proteinuria)\n\nIt's important to note that these are just potential disease entities that could be related to the information provided in the paragraph, and that a definitive diagnosis or identification of a specific disease requires more information and context."},
