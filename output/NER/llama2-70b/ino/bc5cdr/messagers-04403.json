Left ventricular beta adrenoceptor densities\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph mentions that the densities of alpha and beta adrenoceptors in the left ventricle were reduced compared to controls. This implies that there is a disease or condition that has caused a decrease in the density of these receptors. Therefore, the entities \"Left ventricular alpha adrenoceptor densities\" and \"Left ventricular beta adrenoceptor densities\" can be classified as \"Disease\" entities."},
