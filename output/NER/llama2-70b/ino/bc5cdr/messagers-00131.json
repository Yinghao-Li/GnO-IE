It is a metal and is commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.\n2. Calcium - Calcium is a chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20. It is a metal and is essential for many physiological processes, including muscle contraction, nerve function, and bone health. Hypercalcemia is a condition in which there is an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are lithium and calcium."},
