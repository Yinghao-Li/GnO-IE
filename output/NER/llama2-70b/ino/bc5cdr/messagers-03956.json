Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) - HRT is a medical treatment that involves taking hormones to replace those that the body is not producing or producing at lower levels, such as during menopause. HRT contains chemicals that are synthetic versions of the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\n2. Estrogen - Estrogen is a hormone that is produced by the ovaries and plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. In HRT, estrogen is often used in the form of estradiol, which is a synthetic version of the hormone.\n3. Progesterone - Progesterone is a hormone that is produced by the ovaries and helps to prepare the uterus for pregnancy. In HRT, progesterone is often used in the form of progestin, which is a synthetic version of the hormone.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT)\n* Estradiol (a synthetic version of estrogen)\n* Progestin (a synthetic version of progesterone)"},
