Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for an organization.\n\nThe term \"mutineers\" could potentially refer to an organization, but it is not clear from the context whether they are a formal organization or a group of individuals who are acting together in a rebellious manner. Therefore, it is not included in the list of organizations.\n\nThe term \"city centre\" is not an organization, but rather a location.\n\nTherefore, the only entity that clearly refers to an organization in the given paragraph is \"French troops\"."},
