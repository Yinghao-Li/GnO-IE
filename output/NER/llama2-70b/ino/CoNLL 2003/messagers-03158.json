Based on the format of the names, it appears that the first number (71, 72) represents the person's age, and the second number (67, 68) represents their year of birth. Therefore, we can infer that Andrew Park and Desvonde Botes are people, and hence, they are not organizations.\n\nSo, the \"Organization\" entities in the paragraph are none."},
