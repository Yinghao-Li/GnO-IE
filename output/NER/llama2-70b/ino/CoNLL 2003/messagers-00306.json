The paragraph describes an event that occurred during an innings (a cricket term) and mentions the crowd, but it does not mention any specific locations.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the paragraph:\n\n* \"On several occasions\" - This phrase describes the frequency of the event.\n* \"during his innings\" - This phrase describes the context in which the event occurred. An innings is a term used in cricket to describe a period of play where one team bats and the other team fields.\n* \"the crowd\" - This refers to the people watching the game.\n* \"joined together\" - This phrase describes the action of the crowd.\n* \"in a series of obscene chants\" - This phrase describes the nature of the crowd's action.\n* \"against him\" - This phrase indicates the target of the crowd's chants.\n\nSince the paragraph does not mention any specific locations, the answer is:\n\nNo \"Location\" entities."},
