Therefore, I cannot identify any \"Organization\" entities in the paragraph.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some possible entities that could be considered as \"Organization\" in a broader sense:\n\n1. Government - The government could be considered an organization that is responsible for managing the flow of migrant workers and addressing any tensions or conflicts that may arise.\n2. Political parties - Political parties could be considered organizations that have a stake in the political feuding mentioned in the paragraph.\n3. Community groups - Community groups or local organizations that work with migrant workers could be considered organizations that may be impacted by the return of migrant workers to their home villages.\n\nPlease note that these are just suggestions, and the specific context of the paragraph may not necessarily imply these entities as organizations."},
