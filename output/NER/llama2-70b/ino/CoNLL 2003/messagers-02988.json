The numbers are not explicitly stated as locations, but they are used to identify specific points or areas on a map. Therefore, they can be considered \"Location\" entities.\n\nThe paragraph does not contain any other explicit references to locations, such as city names, addresses, or landmarks. Therefore, the numbers 20, 5, 9, 6, 26, 31, and 24 are the only entities that can be classified as \"Location\" entities in this paragraph."},
