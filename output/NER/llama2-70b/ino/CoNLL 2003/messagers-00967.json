Van Boxmeer is a person, as indicated by the use of the surname followed by a first name.\n2. Heineken is not a person, but a brand of beer. However, in this context, it is being referred to as an \"up-market import\" and is therefore being personified, or treated as if it were a person. This is a common figure of speech in business and marketing contexts, where brands are often given human-like qualities to make them more relatable and memorable."},
