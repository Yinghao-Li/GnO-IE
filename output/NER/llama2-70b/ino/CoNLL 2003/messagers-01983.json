The fact that the chart cannot be found suggests that it may be a physical document or a digital file that is maintained by an organization, possibly a military or government agency, responsible for minefield management.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Organization\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.

The commission responsible for border protection\n\nThe commission is the only entity in the paragraph that clearly refers to an organization. The mention of a \"minefield chart\" does not provide enough information to determine the organization responsible for maintaining it, and it could potentially be maintained by a variety of organizations, such as a military unit or a government agency. Therefore, the revised list of \"Organization\" entities includes only the commission responsible for border protection."},
