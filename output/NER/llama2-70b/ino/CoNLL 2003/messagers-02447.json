These are both Olympic sports, and the governing body for Olympic skiing competitions is the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Additionally, the paragraph mentions Flachau, Austria as the location of one of the victories, which suggests that the competition was organized by the Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS), which is the international governing body for skiing and snowboarding.
