The numbers represent the positions of the players on the field, with 1 being the goalkeeper and the numbers increasing as you move away from the goal. Therefore, these numbers can be considered \"Location\" entities.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the word \"Arsenal\" is also a location, as it refers to the name of the football club. Therefore, we can consider \"Arsenal\" as an additional \"Location\" entity in this paragraph."},

Therefore, it should be removed from the list of Location entities."},
