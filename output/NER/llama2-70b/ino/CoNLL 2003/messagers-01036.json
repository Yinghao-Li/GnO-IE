However, we can infer the presence of certain organizations based on the context. Here are some possible organizations that might be relevant in this scenario:\n\n1. Oil companies: The paragraph mentions the need to find a new home for 165,000 tonnes of fuel, which suggests that oil companies might be involved in the process.\n2. Shipping companies: The mention of Rotterdam as a prime candidate for the arbitrage from the U.S. to Europe implies that shipping companies might be involved in transporting the fuel.\n3. Port authorities: The mention of Rotterdam as a prime candidate also suggests that the port authorities in Rotterdam might be involved in facilitating the transfer of the fuel.\n\nSo, the \"Organization\" entities that can be identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Oil companies\n2. Shipping companies\n3. Port authorities (specifically, the Port of Rotterdam)"},
