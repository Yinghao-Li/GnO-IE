Local-call operators\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Long-distance operator refers to a company that provides telecommunications services for long-distance calls, which implies a wide geographic area or a national scale.\n* Local-call operators, on the other hand, provide services for local calls, which suggests a smaller geographic area or a regional scale.\n\nTherefore, both long-distance operator and local-call operators can be considered \"Location\" entities as they are associated with specific geographic areas."},

Long-distance operator\n\nThe long-distance operator is a company that provides telecommunications services for long-distance calls, which implies a wide geographic area or a national scale. This entity clearly refers to a location, as it suggests a specific area or region that the company operates in.\n\nI hope this updated list is helpful.
