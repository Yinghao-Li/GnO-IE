It is a measure of the amount of energy absorbed by the material per unit length, and it is typically expressed as a coefficient or a ratio.\n2. visible area refers to the range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that can be detected by the human eye. In this context, it is used to describe the range of wavelengths over which the absorption coefficient is measured."
