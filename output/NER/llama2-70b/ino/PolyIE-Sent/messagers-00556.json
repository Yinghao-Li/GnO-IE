Thiophene is a chemical compound that has a distinctive property of being a planar, unsaturated, and aromatic ring. It is a property name because it describes a specific chemical entity with a unique set of properties.\n2. Thiophene-fused aromatic system polymers are a class of polymers that contain thiophene units in their chemical structure. The term \"thiophene-fused\" describes the property of these polymers having thiophene units fused together to form a larger aromatic system.\n3. OPVs stands for \"organic photovoltaics,\" which is a class of materials that exhibit the property of converting light into electrical energy. The term \"OPVs\" is a property name because it describes a specific class of materials with a particular property."
