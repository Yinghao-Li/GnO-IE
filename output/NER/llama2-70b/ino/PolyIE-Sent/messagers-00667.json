Check if any of the names contain the word \"polymer\":\n\t* Yes, all four names contain the word \"polymer\".\n3. Check if any of the names have a numerical value attached to them:\n\t* Yes, P4, P5, and P6 have numerical values attached to them (4, 5, and 6, respectively).\n4. Check if the numerical values are preceded by a space or a comma:\n\t* Yes, the numerical values are preceded by a space.\n5. Check if the numerical values are in the format of a power of 10 (e.g., 10^053):\n\t* Yes, the numerical values are in the format of a power of 10.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the \"Material Name\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. P1\n2. P4-P6 (since P4, P5, and P6 are all referred to together in the paragraph)\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. P1\n2. P4-P6"
