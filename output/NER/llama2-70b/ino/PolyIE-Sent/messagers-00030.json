Identify the values of these properties:\n\t* intermediate temperature-dependent aggregation strength (for PffBX-TT)\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Aggregation behavior: intermediate temperature-dependent aggregation strength\n2. Temperature-dependent aggregation strength: intermediate\n3. Blend film morphology: controlled\n\nNote that \"intermediate\" is a relative term that implies a middle-of-the-road value between two extremes, but it's still a specific value that can be quantified and compared to other values."
