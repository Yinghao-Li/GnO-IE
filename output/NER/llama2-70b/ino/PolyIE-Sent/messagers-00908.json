Low band gap polymers - This phrase describes a property of a material, specifically the band gap, which is a critical property in the context of electronics and optoelectronics.\n2. Donor materials - This phrase also describes a property of a material, specifically its ability to donate electrons, which is important in the context of organic electronics and photovoltaics.\n3. High performance PSCs - PSCs stands for \"polymer solar cells,\" and \"high performance\" modifies the property of the PSCs, indicating that they have desirable properties such as high efficiency, stability, and durability."
