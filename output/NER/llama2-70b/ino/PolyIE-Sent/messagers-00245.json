Therefore, they are not relevant to the \"Property Value\" entity category.\n\nThe only property that clearly refers to the value of a material property is the \"electrochemical band gap (Eg EC),\" which is a measure of the energy difference between the conduction band and the valence band in a solid-state material. This property is important in the context of electronics and photonics, as it determines the material's ability to absorb and emit light, and it is often used to design and optimize electronic devices such as solar cells and LEDs."
