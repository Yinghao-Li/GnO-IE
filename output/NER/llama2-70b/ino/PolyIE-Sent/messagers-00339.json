To identify the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph, we need to look for the characteristics or attributes of the materials or components that are relevant to their performance in the context of the paragraph.\n\nHere are the \"Property Value\" entities that I could identify:\n\n1. \"heteroatom substitution\" - This refers to the substitution of one or more atoms in a molecule with atoms of a different element, which can affect the properties of the material.\n2. \"charge transporting properties\" - This refers to the ability of a material to transport electrical charge, which is an important property for materials used in electronic devices such as transistors.\n3. \"solution processed\" - This refers to the method of processing the material, in this case, PCDTBT and PCDSeBT, using a solution-based process.\n4. \"semiconducting layer\" - This refers to the layer of material that has semiconducting properties, which is used in the fabrication of transistors.\n5. \"octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)\" - This refers to a specific type of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) that is used to modify the surface of the silicon substrate.\n6. \"Si/SiO2 substrates\" - This refers to the type of substrate used for the fabrication of the transistors, which is a silicon substrate with a silicon dioxide layer.\n\nI hope this helps!
