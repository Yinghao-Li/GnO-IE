First, we can identify the following words as material names:\n\t* PTATDPP\n\t* PTAFDPP\n2. Next, we can check if these words match the pattern of a material name. In this case, both PTATDPP and PTAFDPP contain the prefix \"PT\", which is commonly used for polymer names.\n3. Additionally, both names contain the suffixes \"DPP\" and \"FDPP\", which are also common suffixes for polymer names.\n4. Therefore, we can confirm that PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are indeed material names.\n\nSo, the \"Material Name\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. PTATDPP\n2. PTAFDPP"
