To identify the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph, we need to look for the words or phrases that describe the properties of the solar cells.\n\nHere are the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. \"inverted device structure\" - This describes the structure of the solar cell, which is a property of the device.\n2. \"ITO\" - ITO stands for indium tin oxide, which is a material used in the fabrication of the solar cell. This is a property of the device.\n3. \"ZnO\" - ZnO stands for zinc oxide, which is a material used in the fabrication of the solar cell. This is a property of the device.\n4. \"PffBB-n\" - PffBB-n is a donor material used in the fabrication of the solar cell. This is a property of the device.\n5. \"PC71BM\" - PC71BM is an acceptor material used in the fabrication of the solar cell. This is a property of the device.\n6. \"1 : 2 w / w\" - This refers to the ratio of the donor material (PffBB-n) to the acceptor material (PC71BM) in the solar cell.
