Polymers are materials made up of repeating structural units, and are often used in engineering and industrial applications.\n2. 5% weight loss refers to the temperature at which a material loses 5% of its weight due to decomposition, which is a common way to measure thermal stability.\n3. 313-320 ° C is a temperature range, and is used to describe the thermal stability of the polymers being compared."
