The HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) energy level refers to the energy level at which electrons are most likely to be found in a molecule, while the LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy level refers to the energy level at which electrons are least likely to be found. The difference between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels is related to the electronic properties of a material and can affect its performance in electronic devices."
