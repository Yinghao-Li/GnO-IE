Wide absorption refers to the ability of a material to absorb a wide range of wavelengths, which is a desirable property for a material used in solar cells.\n2. Visible light region refers to the range of wavelengths that are visible to the human eye, typically between 400-700 nanometers.\n3. Light harvesting refers to the ability of a material to absorb light and convert it into electrical energy, which is a key property of a solar cell material.\n4. BHJ PSCs stands for bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells, which are a type of solar cell that uses a combination of materials to absorb light and convert it into electrical energy."
