Let's break down the paragraph and identify the entities that correspond to the \"Property Value\" category.\n\n1. \"difluoro-substituted thiopheneconjugated side chain\" - This is a description of a chemical structure, and it does not directly relate to any physical or chemical property of the polymer. Therefore, it is not a \"Property Value\" entity.\n2. \"bi(alkyl-difluorothienyl)benzodithiophene-fluorobenzotriazole copolymer J91\" - This is the name of a specific polymer, and it describes the chemical structure of the polymer. However, it does not provide any information about the physical or chemical properties of the polymer. Therefore, it is not a \"Property Value\" entity.\n3. \"superior cell performance\" - This phrase describes a physical property of the polymer, specifically its ability to perform well in a cell. Therefore, it is a \"Property Value\" entity.\n4. \"nonfluorinated control polymer\" - This phrase describes a comparison between the polymer J91 and a hypothetical control polymer that lacks fluorine atoms. It does not directly describe a physical or chemical property of the polymer J91, but rather provides a basis for comparison. Therefore, it is not a \"Property Value\" entity.\n\nSo, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* \"superior cell performance\""
