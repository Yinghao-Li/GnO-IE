Identify the names of the polymers mentioned in the paragraph:\n\t* PzNDTDTBT\n\t* PzNDTDTBO\n2. Check if these names contain any abbreviations or symbols that could potentially be considered as \"Material Name\" entities:\n\t* PzNDTDTBT contains the abbreviation \"Pz\" which could be considered a \"Material Name\" entity.\n\t* PzNDTDTBO contains the abbreviation \"Pz\" and the symbol \"BO\" which could also be considered a \"Material Name\" entity.\n3. Check if the names of the polymers have any chemical formulas or structures that could be considered as \"Material Name\" entities:\n\t* PzNDTDTBT does not have a chemical formula or structure that could be considered a \"Material Name\" entity.\n\t* PzNDTDTBO does not have a chemical formula or structure that could be considered a \"Material Name\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
