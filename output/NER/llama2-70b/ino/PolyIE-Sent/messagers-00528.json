Spirobifluorene is a building block for conjugated polymer donor materials, which means it has a specific chemical structure that allows it to participate in the formation of a conjugated polymer.\n2. PSFDTBT is a specific type of conjugated polymer that is being studied for its potential use in polymer solar cells.\n3. Conjugated polymer donor materials are a class of materials that have a repeating structure composed of alternating double and single bonds, which allows them to participate in the formation of a conjugated polymer.\n4. Polymer solar cells are a type of solar cell that uses a polymer as the photovoltaic material.\n5. Device fabrication conditions refer to the conditions under which the polymer solar cells are manufactured, such as temperature, pressure, and concentration of reactants.\n\nBy optimizing the device fabrication conditions, the performance of the PSFDTBT-based polymer solar cells can be improved."
