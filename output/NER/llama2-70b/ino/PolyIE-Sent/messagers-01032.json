The term \"non-fullerene\" indicates that PTATDPP is not a fullerene, which is a type of material known for its electron-accepting properties. The term \"small molecular weight\" suggests that PTATDPP has a relatively low molecular weight, which can affect its solubility and processability. The term \"electron donor material\" indicates that PTATDPP has the ability to donate electrons, which is a key property for materials used in photovoltaic cells."
