Property or characteristic that each entity possesses:\n\t* Donor-acceptor (D-A) type semiconducting copolymers: semiconducting property\n\t* Electron donating units of dithienopyrrole (DTP): electron donating property\n\t* Accepting units of benzothiadiazole (BT): electron accepting property\n\t* Thienyl spacers: spacing property\n\t* Polymer solar cells (PSCs): photovoltaic property\n\t* Fullerene derivatives: electron accepting property\n3. Entities that have a specific value or range of values for the property or characteristic:\n\t* Thienyl spacers: x = 0-2 (specific range of values)\n\t* Donor-acceptor (D-A) type semiconducting copolymers: three kinds (specific number of types)\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
