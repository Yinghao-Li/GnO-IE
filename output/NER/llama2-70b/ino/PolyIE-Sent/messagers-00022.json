The first entity, \"expanded absorption range,\" refers to the material's ability to absorb a wider range of wavelengths, which can improve its efficiency in converting light into electricity. The second entity, \"better molecular planarity,\" refers to the material's molecular structure, which can affect its electronic properties and overall performance.\n\nThe first entity, \"stronger intermolecular interactions,\" does not directly refer to a specific property of the material, but rather describes a potential mechanism by which the material's properties could be improved.
