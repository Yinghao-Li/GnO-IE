V OC (Voc) is the open-circuit voltage of a solar cell, which is a measure of the maximum voltage that can be generated by the cell.\n2. HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) is a term used in organic chemistry and materials science to describe the highest energy level that an electron can occupy in a molecule or material. In the context of the paragraph, HOMO refers to the energy level of the conduction band in a solar cell material.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
