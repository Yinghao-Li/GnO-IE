Here are the entities in the paragraph that can be identified as \"Property Name\" entities:\n\n1. absorption onset\n2. optical bandgap\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"Absorption onset\" is a property of a material that refers to the wavelength or energy at which a material begins to absorb light. It is a characteristic property of a material and can be used to describe its optical properties.\n2. \"Optical bandgap\" is a property of a material that refers to the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band of a solid. It is a measure of the energy required to move an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, and it is an important property in the study of semiconductors and optoelectronic devices.\n\nTherefore, both \"absorption onset\" and \"optical bandgap\" can be identified as \"Property Name\" entities in the given paragraph."

Therefore, it is not a Material Property entity.\n\nThe entity \"optical bandgap\", on the other hand, is a property of a material that refers to the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band of a solid, and is an important property in the study of semiconductors and optoelectronic devices. It is a Material Property entity."
