PCDSeBT is a material name, as it is a polymer name that contains the names of the monomers (phenyl, cyclopentadienyl, and benzothienyl) linked together by their chemical bonds.\n2. Se°°°Se is not a material name, but rather a chemical formula indicating the presence of selenium (Se) atoms in the material. It does not specify a particular material or compound, but rather describes a chemical property of the material. Therefore, it is not a \"Material Name\" entity."
