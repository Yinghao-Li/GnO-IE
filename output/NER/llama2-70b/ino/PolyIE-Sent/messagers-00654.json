HOMO and LUMO refer to the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, respectively, which are important concepts in organic electronics and photovoltaics. Bandgap refers to the energy difference between the valence band and conduction band in a solid, which is a critical property for electronic materials.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Material Name\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1.
