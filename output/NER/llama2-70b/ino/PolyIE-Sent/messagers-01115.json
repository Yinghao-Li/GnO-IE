      "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you identify the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph.\n\nStep 1: Identify the properties:\n\nThe paragraph mentions the following properties of photovoltaic μmR - polymers:\n\n1. Broad absorption\n2. High LUMO energy level\n3. Low HOMO level\n4. High carrier mobility\n5. Good solubility\n6. Appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives\n\nStep 2: Identify the values:\n\nThe paragraph does not explicitly mention the specific values for each property. However, we can infer some general value ranges based on the context:\n\n1. Broad absorption: The paragraph mentions that the absorption should extend to or surpass 1 μm, so the value range for this property could be 1 μm or higher.\n2. High LUMO energy level: The paragraph states that the LUMO energy level should be high to allow effective photoinduced charge transfer, but does not provide a specific value. However, we know that LUMO energy levels typically range from -1 eV to -4 eV.\n3. Low HOMO level: The paragraph states that the HOMO level should be low to keep the open circuit voltage (VOC) as high as possible. The HOMO energy level typically ranges from -5 eV to -1 eV.\n4. High carrier mobility: The paragraph does not provide a specific value for carrier mobility, but high carrier mobility generally means a value of 10^-3 cm^2/Vs or higher.\n5. Good solubility: The paragraph does not provide a specific value for solubility, but we can infer that the polymer should be soluble in a solvent to form a high-quality film by solution processing.\n6. Appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives: The paragraph does not provide a specific value for compatibility, but we can infer that the polymer should be compatible with fullerene derivatives to form a stable and efficient BHJ device.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph as follows:\n\n1. Broad absorption: 1 μm or higher\n2. High LUMO energy level: -1 eV to -4 eV\n3. Low HOMO level: -5 eV to -1 eV\n4. High carrier mobility: 10^-3 cm^2/Vs or higher\n5. Good solubility: Soluble in a solvent\n6. Appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives: Compatible with fullerene derivatives to form a stable and efficient BHJ device."
