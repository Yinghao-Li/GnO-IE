P1 and PC61BM are the two materials used to create the bulk heterojunction in the OPV devices. They are the \"Property Value\" entities because they are the materials that determine the electronic properties of the device.\n2. ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) is a transparent conductive oxide that is used as the anode in the OPV devices. It is a \"Property Value\" entity because it provides a specific property (transparency and conductivity) that is important for the device's performance.\n3. PEDOT (Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) and PSS (Polystyrene sulfonate) are both used as hole transporting materials in the OPV devices. They are \"Property Value\" entities because they provide specific properties (conductivity and hole transportability) that are important for the device's performance.\n4. Al (Aluminum) is used as the cathode in the OPV devices. It is a \"Property Value\" entity because it provides a specific property (conductivity) that is important for the device's performance.\n\nBy identifying the \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph, we can understand the materials and properties that are important for the fabrication and performance of the OPV devices."
