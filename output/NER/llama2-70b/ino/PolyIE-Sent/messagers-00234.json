POBDTPD and PEBDTPD are property names because they are names of materials or compounds that have specific properties, such as light absorption and efficient exciton separation.\n2. PC 7^0 BM and PC 70 BM are property names because they are names of materials or compounds that have specific properties, such as light absorption and efficient exciton separation.\n3.

      "content": "Sure! Let's identify the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph step by step:\n\n1. P O B D T P D : P C 7^0 B M\n\nIn this phrase, \"P O B D T P D\" is a property value entity, specifically the name of a material or a device.\n\n2. PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM\n\nIn this phrase, \"PEBDTPD\" is a property value entity, specifically the name of a material or a device.\n\n3. light absorption up to 900 nm\n\nIn this phrase, \"900 nm\" is a property value entity, specifically the wavelength of light that is being absorbed.\n\n4. optimal morphology\n\nIn this phrase, \"optimal\" is an adjective modifying the noun \"morphology,\" which refers to the structure or form of a material or device. Therefore, \"optimal morphology\" is a property value entity.\n\n5. efficient exciton separation\n\nIn this phrase, \"efficient\" is an adjective modifying the noun \"exciton separation,\" which refers to the process of separating excitons (quasi-particles that consist of an electron and a hole) in a material. Therefore, \"efficient exciton separation\" is a property value entity.\n\n6. PCEs exceeding 5%\n\nIn this phrase, \"PCEs\" stands for \"power conversion efficiencies,\" which is a measure of the efficiency of a solar cell or other energy conversion device. \"Exceeding 5%\" is an adjective phrase modifying the noun \"PCEs,\" indicating that the PCEs are greater than 5%. Therefore, \"PCEs exceeding 5%\" is a property value entity.\n\nSo, the \"Property Value\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. P O B D T P D\n2.
