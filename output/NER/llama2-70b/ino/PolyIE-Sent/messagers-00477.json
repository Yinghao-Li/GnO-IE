V oc (open-circuit voltage) is a material property that describes the maximum voltage that can be generated by a solar cell when it is not connected to a load.\n2. J sc (short-circuit current density) is a material property that describes the maximum current density that can be generated by a solar cell when it is short-circuited.\n3. FF (fill factor) is a material property that describes the ratio of the active area of a solar cell to the total area of the cell. It is a measure of how efficiently the cell is able to convert sunlight into electrical energy."
