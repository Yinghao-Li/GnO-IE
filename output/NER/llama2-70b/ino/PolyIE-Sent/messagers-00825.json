If the entity has a value or range of values, then it can be considered a \"Property Value\" entity.\n\nApplying this approach to the given paragraph, we can identify the following \"Property Value\" entities:\n\n1. π-π* transitions - The absorption spectra display π-π* transitions at around 425 nm.\n\t* Property: Absorption spectra\n\t* Value: 425 nm\n2. Charge transfer features - The absorption spectra display large charge transfer features between 500 and 700 nm.\n\t* Property: Charge transfer features\n\t* Value: 500-700 nm\n3.
