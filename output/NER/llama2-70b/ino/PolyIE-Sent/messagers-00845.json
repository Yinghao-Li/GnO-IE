Hole mobility is a property of a material that refers to the speed at which holes (positive charge carriers) can move through the material.\n2. PzNDTDTBO is a material that is being discussed in the paragraph, and it is a property of this material that is being evaluated.\n3. Photovoltaic donor materials are materials that are used in solar cells to convert sunlight into electricity.\n4. PSCs stands for \"perovskite solar cells,\" which are a type of solar cell that uses a perovskite-structured compound as the light-absorbing material."
