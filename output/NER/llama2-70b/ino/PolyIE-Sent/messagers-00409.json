HOMO energy level is a property of the polymer films, and it is the energy level at which the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is located.\n2. Oxidation onsets (Eox) are the energies at which the oxidation reactions of the polymer films begin. They are also properties of the polymer films.\n\nTherefore, both HOMO energy level and oxidation onsets (Eox) are \"Property Value\" entities in the paragraph."
