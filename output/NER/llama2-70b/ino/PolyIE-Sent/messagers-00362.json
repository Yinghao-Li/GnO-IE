It is a measure of the material's ability to absorb light and generate charge carriers (electrons and holes).\n2. AM 1.5G (Air Mass 1.5 Global) is a reference spectrum used to evaluate the performance of solar cells. It represents the solar irradiance under standard test conditions (STC) and is used as a reference for comparing the performance of solar cells under different lighting conditions."
