APFO - Green1\n2. μmR - polymer\n\nHere's a breakdown of why I identified these entities as \"Material Name\" entities:\n\n1. APFO - Green1: This is a specific name given to a type of polymer, which suggests that it is a material. The \"APFO\" part of the name likely stands for \"alkylphenol formaldehyde oxide,\" which is a type of polymer precursor. The \"Green1\" part of the name suggests that this material is a specific variation of the APFO polymer that has been developed for a particular application.\n2. μmR - polymer: This entity is a bit more ambiguous, but based on the context of the sentence, it seems likely that \"μmR - polymer\" is a material name. The \"μmR\" part of the name likely stands for \"micrometer response,\" which suggests that this material is capable of responding to changes in its environment at the micrometer scale. The \"polymer\" part of the name indicates that this material is a type of polymer, which is a class of materials that are made up of long chains of repeating molecules."
