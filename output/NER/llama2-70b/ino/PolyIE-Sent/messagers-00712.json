Low-band-gap polymers - This is a property of the material being discussed, specifically the energy gap or band gap, which is a measure of the energy difference between the valence and conduction bands in a solid.\n2. Greater part of the solar spectrum - This is a property of the solar radiation that the polymer solar cells are designed to absorb, referring to the range of wavelengths or energies of light that the cells can harness.\n3. 7-9 % - This is a property of the efficiency of the polymer solar cells, indicating the percentage of incoming sunlight that can be converted into electrical energy."
