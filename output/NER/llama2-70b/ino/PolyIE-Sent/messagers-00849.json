Check if any of the named materials are mentioned in the context of a weight ratio:\n\nYes, PzNDTDTBO and PC71BM are mentioned in the context of a weight ratio of 1.5:1.\n3. Check if any of the named materials are mentioned in the context of a PCE (power conversion efficiency) value:\n\nYes, PzNDTDTBO and PzNDTDTBT are mentioned in the context of PCE values.\n4. Check if any of the named materials are mentioned in the context of a Voc (open-circuit voltage) value:\n\nYes, PzNDTDTBO and PzNDTDTBT are mentioned in the context of Voc values.\n5. Check if any of the named materials are mentioned in the context of a Jsc (short-circuit current density) value:\n\nYes, PzNDTDTBO and PzNDTDTBT are mentioned in the context of Jsc values.\n6. Check if any of the named materials are mentioned in the context of a FF (fill factor) value:\n\nYes, PzNDTDTBO and PzNDTDTBT are mentioned in the context of FF values.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph:\n\n1.
