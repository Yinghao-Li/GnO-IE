The parentheses and the letters inside them indicate that it is a polymer, and the letters inside the parentheses represent the specific monomers that make up the polymer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"Highly soluble\" and \"Poly[quinacridone-alt-benzothiadiazole]\" (PQCDTB)."
