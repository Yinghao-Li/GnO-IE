E HOMO (HOMO Energy): HOMO stands for Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital. In computational chemistry, HOMO energy refers to the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital in a molecule.\n2. E ox onset (Onset Oxidation Potential): E ox onset is the onset oxidation potential, which is the potential required to oxidize a molecule. In the context of the paragraph, E ox onset is used as an input parameter to calculate the HOMO energy.\n3. Ag / Ag + (Silver/Silver Ion): Ag / Ag + refers to the silver/silver ion redox couple. In the context of the paragraph, Ag / Ag + is used as a reference electrode in the calculation of the onset oxidation potential."
