Identify the entities that have these properties:\nThe entities that have the \"J SC\" and \"PCE\" values are the PBDTT-DPP-TPD random terpolymers themselves.\n3. Identify the entities that are being modified or changed:\nThe paragraph mentions that the molecular geometries and electron density distribution are being simulated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level with the Spartan 08 software package. This implies that the molecular geometries and electron density distribution are being modified or changed.\n4.
