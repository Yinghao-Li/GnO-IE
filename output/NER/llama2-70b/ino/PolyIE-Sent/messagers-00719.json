BDTT\n3. DPP\n4. TPD\n\nHere's a brief explanation of why each of these names represents a material:\n\n1. PBDTT- DPP - TPD: This is the name of the novel copolymer material that is the focus of the paragraph. It is a combination of three components: BDTT, DPP, and TPD.\n2. BDTT: BDTT is an abbreviation for \"thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene,\" which is a type of molecule that is used as a building block in the synthesis of the copolymer material.\n3. DPP: DPP stands for \"dithienyl-substituted pyrrole-pyrrole-1,4-dione,\" which is another type of molecule used as a building block in the synthesis of the copolymer material.\n4. TPD: TPD stands for \"thienyl-substituted pyrrole-pyrrole-4,6-dione,\" which is the third type of molecule used as a building block in the synthesis of the copolymer material.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
