PBDT-TDPP-S is a material name because it is a specific compound that is being analyzed in the Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis.\n2. Mn is a material name because it is a molecular weight measurement that is being reported for PBDT-TDPP-S.\n3. Figure S1 is not a material name, but rather a reference to a figure that is not shown in the paragraph. It is not a material name because it does not refer to a specific material or substance.\n\nTherefore, the two Material Name entities in the paragraph are PBDT-TDPP-S and Mn."
