Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is discussing the results of an experiment or study related to Factor H deficiency in children.\n2. Identify the key words and phrases related to disease:\n * \"homozygous deficiency\"\n * \"absence of the 150 - kD form of Factor H\"\n * \"presence of the 42 - kD Factor H - like protein 1 (FHL - 1)\"\n * \"other FH - related protein (FHR) bands\"\n3. Identify the disease entities:\n * Factor H deficiency\n * Homozygous deficiency\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n1. Factor H deficiency\n2.
