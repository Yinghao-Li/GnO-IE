Linkage refers to the association or connection between a genetic marker and a specific disease or trait.\n2. Markers are genetic markers, which are specific DNA sequences that are associated with a particular disease or trait.\n3. Chromosome 4p is a specific chromosomal location that has been linked to a disease or trait.\n4. Families refer to the families that have been studied and in which the linkage to chromosome 4p has been confirmed.\n\nTherefore, all four entities can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},
