FGFR mutations\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the skull, face, and limbs. It is caused by mutations in the TWIST or FGFR genes.\n* TWIST mutations and FGFR mutations are genetic changes that can cause Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. They are therefore associated with the disease.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, TWIST mutations, and FGFR mutations."},
