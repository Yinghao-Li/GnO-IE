Six different mutations\n\nThe phrase \"12 of the 16 alleles examined\" does not directly refer to a disease, so it should not be considered a \"Disease\" entity. The sentence mentions mutations, which could be indicative of a genetic disorder or disease, but without further context, it's difficult to determine if the mutations are actually causing a disease. Therefore, the only clear \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph is \"six different mutations\"."},
