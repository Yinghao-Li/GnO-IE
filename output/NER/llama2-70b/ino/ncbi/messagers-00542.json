The term \"mutation\" could potentially refer to a genetic change that leads to a disease, but without additional context, it is not clear whether this mutation has any disease-causing potential. Similarly, the term \"NdeI restriction enzyme site\" refers to a specific genetic sequence that is recognized by the NdeI restriction enzyme, but it does not directly relate to disease. Therefore, there are no disease entities in this paragraph."},
