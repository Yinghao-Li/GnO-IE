Wilson disease\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that affects the liver and nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which codes for a protein involved in copper transport. The paragraph suggests that a specific mutation at nucleotide 2302 (2302insC) in the ATP7B gene may lead to gene rearrangements that cause Wilson disease. Therefore, Wilson disease is the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph."},
