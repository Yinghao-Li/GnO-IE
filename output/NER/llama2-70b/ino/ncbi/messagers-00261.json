Hyperymethylated DMPK gene\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Hypermethylated\" refers to the abnormal addition of methyl groups to the DNA molecule, which can silences gene expression and lead to various diseases.\n* \"DMPK\" stands for \"dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase\" gene, which is associated with myotonic dystrophy, a genetic disorder that affects muscle strength and function.\n\nTherefore, a hypermethylated DMPK gene is a disease-causing entity in the paragraph."},
