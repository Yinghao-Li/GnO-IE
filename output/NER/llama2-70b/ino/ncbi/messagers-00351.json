Frameshift mutation\n\nExplanation:\n\nA missense mutation is a genetic mutation that results in a different amino acid being inserted into a protein sequence, which can cause the protein to malfunction. In this paragraph, the missense mutation is associated with sodium channels that recover from inactivation more rapidly than normal.\n\nA frameshift mutation, on the other hand, is a genetic mutation that results in the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides in a protein sequence, leading to a change in the reading frame of the genetic code. In this paragraph, the frameshift mutation is associated with sodium channels that are non-functional.\n\nTherefore, both the missense mutation and the frameshift mutation can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph, as they both affect the functioning of sodium channels and may lead to disease states."},

Frameshift mutation\n\nThe frameshift mutation is associated with sodium channels that are non-functional, which can lead to disease states. Therefore, it can be considered a Disease entity in this paragraph.\n\nThe missense mutation, on the other hand, is not directly associated with disease in the paragraph, as it is described as causing sodium channels to recover from inactivation more rapidly than normal. Therefore, it can be removed from the list of Disease entities.\n\nSo, the final list of Disease entities in the paragraph is:\n\n1. Frameshift mutation"},
