Deletion or insertion events\n\nThese three entities are directly mentioned as disease-causing mechanisms in the paragraph. The other entities mentioned, such as C-T changes at CpG dinucleotides, are not directly referred to as diseases, but rather as types of mutations that can occur in the PAX6 gene."},
