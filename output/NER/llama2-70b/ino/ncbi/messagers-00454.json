AAPC families: AAPC (adenomatous polyposis coli) families are families that have a history of colorectal cancer and other cancers due to mutations in the APC gene.\n2. APC mutation: APC mutation refers to a genetic alteration in the APC gene, which is associated with colorectal cancer and other cancers.\n3. specific phenotypic expression: Phenotypic expression refers to the physical characteristics or symptoms of a disease. In this context, specific phenotypic expression refers to the specific symptoms or characteristics that are associated with APC mutations in AAPC families."},
