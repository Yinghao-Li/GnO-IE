Retinoblastoma is a type of cancer that affects the retina and is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene.\n2. Unilateral retinoblastoma refers to the presence of retinoblastoma in one eye.\n\nTherefore, both \"retinoblastoma\" and \"unilateral retinoblastoma\" can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},

Retinoblastoma is a type of cancer that affects the retina and is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene. It is clearly referred to as a disease in the paragraph.\n\nThe entity \"unilateral retinoblastoma\" is not included in the revised list because it is a descriptive term that refers to the location of the disease (one eye) rather than the disease itself."},
