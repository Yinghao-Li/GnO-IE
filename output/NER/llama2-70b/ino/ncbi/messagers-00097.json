Prostate tumors are abnormal growths of prostate cells that can be benign or malignant. They are considered a disease entity because they can cause symptoms, discomfort, and potentially life-threatening complications.\n2. Chromosome 10q23 deletion is a genetic alteration that is associated with prostate cancer. It is considered a disease entity because it can contribute to the development and progression of cancer.\n\nTherefore, the two disease entities in the paragraph are prostate tumors and chromosome 10q23 deletion."},

Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that affects the prostate gland. It is clearly a disease entity because it is a harmful condition that can cause symptoms and death.\n2. Chromosome 10q23 deletion is a genetic alteration that is associated with prostate cancer.
