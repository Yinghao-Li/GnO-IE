Missense mutations are a type of genetic mutation that can lead to a change in the function or structure of a protein, which can result in disease.\n2. Functional significance refers to the potential impact of a genetic mutation on the function of a protein, which can also contribute to disease.\n\nTherefore, both missense mutations and functional significance are related to the concept of disease in the paragraph."},
