To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we need to look for keywords or phrases that indicate the presence of a disease or medical condition.\n\nHere are the possible disease entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. APC gene\n2. Mutations\n\nThe paragraph mentions the APC gene, which is a gene that has been associated with certain diseases, including colorectal cancer and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The presence of mutations in the APC gene can lead to the development of these diseases. Therefore, both \"APC gene\" and \"mutations\" can be considered disease entities in this paragraph.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. APC gene\n2. Mutations"},
