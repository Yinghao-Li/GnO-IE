Wild-type PAX6\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Mutants\" refers to genetically modified organisms or cells that have undergone a change in their DNA sequence, which may lead to changes in their phenotype or behavior. In this context, the mutants are being studied to understand their effect on the expression of the PAX6 gene.\n* \"Wild-type PAX6\" refers to the normal, non-mutated version of the PAX6 gene. It is used as a control in the transient transfection assays to compare the expression of the mutated PAX6 gene.\n\nTherefore, both \"Mutants\" and \"Wild-type PAX6\" are \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph, as they are related to the study of genetic mutations and their effects on gene expression."},
