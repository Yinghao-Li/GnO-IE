RB1 gene: The paragraph mentions the RB1 gene, which is a gene that has been associated with certain diseases, such as retinoblastoma.\n2. Mutations: The paragraph mentions mutations in the RB1 gene, which can affect the function of the gene and lead to disease.\n3. Genetic counseling: The paragraph mentions genetic counseling, which is the process of providing information and guidance to families about genetic disorders and their risk of inheritance.\n4. Families with distinctive phenotypes: The paragraph mentions families with distinctive phenotypes, which are characteristics that are associated with a specific genetic disorder. In this case, the paragraph suggests that the families have a genetic predisposition to certain diseases due to mutations in the RB1 gene."},
