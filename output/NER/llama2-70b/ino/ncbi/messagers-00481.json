ATM mutant alleles\n\nIn this paragraph, \"ATM mutant alleles\" refers to genetic mutations that have occurred in the ATM gene, which is associated with an increased risk of developing certain diseases, such as cancer and ataxia-telangiectasia. The paragraph suggests that two specific founder mutations may be predominant among Japanese ATM mutant alleles, indicating that these mutations are common in the Japanese population and may contribute to the development of disease in individuals who carry them."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's the updated list of entities that refer to Disease in the given paragraph:\n\n1. ataxia-telangiectasia\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and nervous system, leading to symptoms such as difficulty walking, poor coordination, and a weakened immune system. It is caused by mutations in the ATM gene, which is also associated with an increased risk of cancer. The paragraph suggests that two specific founder mutations may be predominant among Japanese ATM mutant alleles, which could contribute to the development of ataxia-telangiectasia in individuals who carry them."},
