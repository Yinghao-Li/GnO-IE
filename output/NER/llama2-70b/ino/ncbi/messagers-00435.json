Hemochromatosis is a disease caused by a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb and process iron, leading to excessive iron accumulation in the body's tissues and organs.\n2. HFE is the gene associated with hemochromatosis. The paragraph mentions that the HFE gene has been identified and characterized, and that it contains two mutations that result in amino acid substitutions.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Hemochromatosis and HFE, as they are both related to the genetic disorder and its underlying genetic cause."},
