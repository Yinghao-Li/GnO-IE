Identify the keywords: The keywords in the paragraph are \"Dp71 transcripts,\" \"Dp140 DNA sequences,\" \"severe cerebral dysfunction,\" and \"patients.\"\n2. Identify the entities:\n\na. Dp71 transcripts - This is a gene or protein entity.\n\nb. Dp140 DNA sequences - This is a gene or protein entity.\n\nc. severe cerebral dysfunction - This is a disease or disorder entity.\n\nd. patients - This is a group entity.\n3. Identify the relationships:\n\na. Dp71 transcripts and Dp140 DNA sequences are related to each other as they are both genetic entities.\n\nb. severe cerebral dysfunction is related to Dp71 transcripts and Dp140 DNA sequences as it is a disease or disorder that is associated with alterations in these genetic entities.\n\nc. patients are related to severe cerebral dysfunction as they are the individuals affected by the disease or disorder.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. severe cerebral dysfunction\n2. Dp71 transcripts (as they are associated with the disease)\n3. Dp140 DNA sequences (as they are associated with the disease)"},
