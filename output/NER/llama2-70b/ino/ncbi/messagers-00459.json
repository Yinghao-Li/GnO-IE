WT1 - KTS isoforms: WT1 is a gene that is associated with various diseases, including Wilms' tumor, a type of cancer that affects the kidneys. The KTS isoforms of WT1 are also implicated in cancer development.\n2. SF - 1: SF-1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis, including the production of sex hormones. Mutations in the SF-1 gene have been associated with various endocrine disorders, including congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n3. MIS expression: MIS (Mullerian inhibiting substance) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the development of the reproductive system. Abnormalities in MIS expression have been linked to various reproductive disorders, including infertility and sex reversal.\n\nTherefore, all three entities mentioned in the paragraph are associated with diseases, making them \"Disease\" entities."},
