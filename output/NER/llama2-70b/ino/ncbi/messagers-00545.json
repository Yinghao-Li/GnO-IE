    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Maternal disomy\n2. Prader-Willi syndrome\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Maternal disomy refers to a condition where an individual has two copies of the same chromosome from their mother, instead of one copy from each parent.\n* Prader-Willi syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the loss of function of certain genes on chromosome 15, specifically the q11.2 region. It is characterized by a range of symptoms including intellectual disability, delayed development, and obesity.\n\nThe paragraph suggests that the individual in question has a familial translocation (a chromosomal abnormality) involving chromosomes 3 and 15, with the genetic material from the q11.2 region of chromosome 15 being inherited from the mother, resulting in the development of Prader-Willi syndrome. The phrase \"consistent with gamete complementation\" suggests that the genetic material from the mother's chromosome 15 is complementing the missing genetic material on the father's chromosome 15, leading to the development of the syndrome."},
