Identify the gene mentioned in the paragraph:\n\nThe gene mentioned in the paragraph is \"low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5\" (LRP5).\n2. Identify the protein encoded by the gene:\n\nThe protein encoded by the gene LRP5 is a protein of 1615 amino acids that contains conserved modules which are characteristic of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family.\n3. Identify the disease associated with the protein:\n\nThe protein encoded by LRP5 is associated with various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cardiovascular disease\n2. Cancer\n3. Neurodegenerative disorders"},
