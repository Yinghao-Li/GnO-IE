Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is discussing a genetic mutation and its association with an increased risk of breast cancer.\n2. Identify the genetic mutation: The mutation is identified as an ATM mutation (7271T -> G).\n3. Identify the disease associated with the mutation: The disease associated with the mutation is breast cancer.\n4. Identify the population affected by the mutation: The mutation is found in two A-T families, and the risk of breast cancer is increased in both homozygotes and heterozygotes.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Breast cancer\n2. A-T disease (a less severe phenotype of the disease in terms of cerebellar degeneration)\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n1. Breast cancer\n2. A-T disease"},
