MPS IVA\n2. missense mutations\n\nExplanation:\n\n* MPS IVA is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase, which leads to the accumulation of sulfatides in various tissues, particularly in the brain and skeleton.\n* Missense mutations are genetic mutations that result in a different amino acid being inserted into a protein sequence, which can affect the function or structure of the protein. In this paragraph, the missense mutations are novel, meaning they have not been identified previously in other populations.\n\nTherefore, MPS IVA and missense mutations are the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},
