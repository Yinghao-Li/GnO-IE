Friedreich ataxia is a disease caused by an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the FRDA gene. Therefore, it is a disease entity.\n2. GAA trinucleotide repeat is a genetic abnormality that causes Friedreich ataxia. Therefore, it is a disease entity.\n3. FRDA gene is a gene that, when mutated, can cause Friedreich ataxia. Therefore, it is a disease entity."},
