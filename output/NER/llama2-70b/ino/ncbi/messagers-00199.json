    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. A-T heterozygotes\n\nExplanation:\n\nA-T heterozygotes are individuals who carry a mutated version of the ATM gene, which is associated with Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and immune system. A-T heterozygotes are carriers of the mutated gene, but they do not typically display symptoms of the disease themselves. However, they have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of their children, who may then develop A-T disease.\n\nTherefore, in the context of the paragraph, \"A-T heterozygotes\" refers to individuals who carry the mutated ATM gene and are at risk of passing it on to their offspring, potentially leading to the development of A-T disease in their children."},

Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T)\n\nExplanation:\n\nAtaxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and immune system. It is caused by mutations in the ATM gene, which is the focus of the paragraph. The mention of A-T disease in the paragraph makes it clear that the author is discussing the disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T)."},
