T1372C (F458L) missense mutation\n3. 1668 ACAG 1669 splice site mutation\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. VLCAD gene: VLCAD (very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) is a gene that provides instructions for making an enzyme involved in the breakdown of fatty acids.\n2. T1372C (F458L) missense mutation: This is a genetic mutation that affects the VLCAD gene. The \"T1372C\" refers to a change in the DNA sequence of the gene, where the nucleotide \"T\" at position 1372 is replaced with \"C\". This results in a change in the amino acid sequence of the enzyme, where the amino acid \"phenylalanine\" (F) at position 458 is replaced with \"leucine\" (L). This change in the enzyme's structure may affect its function.\n3. 1668 ACAG 1669 splice site mutation: This is another genetic mutation that affects the VLCAD gene. The \"1668 ACAG 1669\" refers to a specific sequence of nucleotides in the gene that is involved in the splicing of the RNA molecule during protein synthesis. The splice site mutation may disrupt the normal splicing of the RNA, leading to a non-functional protein.\n\nBoth of these mutations may lead to a disease caused by a deficiency in the VLCAD enzyme, which is important for the breakdown of fatty acids in the body. The specific disease associated with these mutations is likely to be a genetic disorder affecting the metabolism of fatty acids, such as a fatty acid oxidation disorder."},
