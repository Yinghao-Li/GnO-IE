Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase, which leads to the accumulation of sulfatides in various tissues, resulting in a range of symptoms including developmental delay, intellectual disability, and physical abnormalities.\n* The paragraph mentions a novel common missense mutation G301C in the N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase gene, which is associated with mucopolysaccharidosis IVA.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA\n\nNote: \"Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA\" is sometimes also referred to as \"Morquio syndrome.\""},

Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA\n\nThe mention of \"N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase\" is not a disease entity, but rather an enzyme that is deficient in individuals with mucopolysaccharidosis IVA. Therefore, the revised list only includes \"Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA\" as the disease entity."},
