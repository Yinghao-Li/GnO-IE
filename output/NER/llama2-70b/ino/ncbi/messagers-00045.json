C5 deficiency is a disease or medical condition that affects the levels of C5 in the body.\n2. Autosomal codominant inheritance is a pattern of inheritance that suggests that the gene responsible for C5 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal codominant manner, meaning that the gene is located on an autosome (i.e., not on the X or Y chromosome) and that both copies of the gene (one inherited from each parent) have an equal effect on the phenotype."},
