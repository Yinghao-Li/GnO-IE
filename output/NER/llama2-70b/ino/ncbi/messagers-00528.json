It is caused by an expansion of a CCTG repeat in the DMPK gene, which leads to a variety of symptoms including muscle stiffness, weakness, and wasting.\n\nTherefore, the phrase \"myotonic dystrophy region\" in the paragraph refers to the genetic region that contains the DMPK gene and the expanded CCTG repeat that causes the disease.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Myotonic dystrophy\n* Somatic instability of the CTG repeat (which is a feature of myotonic dystrophy)"},
