    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. FGFR3 P250R mutation\n2. FGFR2 VV269-270 deletion\n\nExplanation:\n\n* FGFR3 P250R mutation and FGFR2 VV269-270 deletion are both genetic mutations that can cause diseases.\n* FGFR3 P250R mutation is a point mutation that affects the FGFR3 gene, which is involved in cell signaling pathways. This mutation can cause a variety of diseases, including skeletal disorders and cancer.\n* FGFR2 VV269-270 deletion is a deletion mutation that affects the FGFR2 gene, which is also involved in cell signaling pathways. This mutation can cause similar diseases as the FGFR3 P250R mutation, including skeletal disorders and cancer.\n\nTherefore, both FGFR3 P250R mutation and FGFR2 VV269-270 deletion can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},
