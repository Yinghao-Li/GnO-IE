BRCA1 is a gene that is associated with breast and ovarian cancer. Mutations in this gene can increase the risk of developing these cancers. Therefore, BRCA1 can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n2. Hyperphosphorylated BRCA1 polypeptides are abnormally modified forms of the BRCA1 protein that accumulate in cells during the S phase of the cell cycle. This accumulation is associated with an increased risk of cancer, making hyperphosphorylated BRCA1 polypeptides a disease entity.\n3. BRCA1 nuclear dots are subnuclear structures that form when BRCA1 polypeptides accumulate in cells. These structures are associated with an increased risk of cancer, making BRCA1 nuclear dots a disease entity."},
