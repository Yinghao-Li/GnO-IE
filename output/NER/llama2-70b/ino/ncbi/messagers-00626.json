VLCAD deficiency\n\nExplanation: VLCAD (very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the breakdown of fatty acids in the body. It is caused by mutations in the VLCAD gene, which codes for the VLCAD enzyme. The deficiency leads to a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, fatigue, and liver problems.\n\nTherefore, \"VLCAD deficiency\" is a disease entity in the paragraph."},

VLCAD deficiency\n\nThe term \"stable yet inactive enzyme\" refers to the VLCAD enzyme, which is not functioning properly due to a genetic mutation. This leads to the disease entity \"VLCAD deficiency\".\n\nTherefore, the final list of disease entities in the paragraph is:\n\n1. VLCAD deficiency"},
