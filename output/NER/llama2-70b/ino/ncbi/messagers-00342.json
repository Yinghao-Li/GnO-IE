Decreased smooth pursuit gain\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. SCA3 is a genetic disorder that affects the cerebellum and causes progressive degeneration of the cerebellar neurons, leading to problems with movement, coordination, and balance.\n2. Gaze-evoked nystagmus is a type of involuntary eye movement that occurs when the eyes move rapidly in response to a change in the direction of gaze. It is a common symptom of certain neurological disorders, including SCA3.\n3. Saccade hypometria is a condition where the eyes do not move quickly enough to track a moving object or to shift gaze between different points. It is another common symptom of SCA3.\n4. Decreased smooth pursuit gain refers to a decrease in the ability of the eyes to smoothly track a moving object. It is a symptom of SCA3 and other cerebellar disorders."},
