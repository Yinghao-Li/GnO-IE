    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. TSD gene\n2. rare (allelic) mutant gene\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. TSD gene: TSD stands for \"target gene for splicing defects,\" which implies that mutations in this gene can lead to splicing defects, which can result in disease.\n2. rare (allelic) mutant gene: The phrase \"rare (allelic) mutant gene\" suggests that this gene is an alternative form of a gene that is not commonly found in the population, and it is associated with a disease. The word \"allelic\" implies that this gene is related to the TSD gene, and both genes may be responsible for the disease."},
