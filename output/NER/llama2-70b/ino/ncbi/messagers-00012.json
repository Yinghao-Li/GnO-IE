It is caused by a mutation in the DMPK gene, which codes for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase. This protein is involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells.\n\nThe disease entities in this paragraph are:\n\n1. Myotonic dystrophy\n2. DMPK gene\n3. Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
