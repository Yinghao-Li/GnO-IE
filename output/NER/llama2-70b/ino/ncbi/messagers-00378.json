Ashkenazi mutation carriers: These are individuals who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene and are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The term \"Ashkenazi\" refers to a Jewish ethnic group with origins in Central and Eastern Europe.\n2. BRCA1 locus: This refers to the location of the BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17. The BRCA1 gene is associated with an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the individuals who carry the mutation in the BRCA1 gene and the genetic location of the gene itself."},

BRCA1 locus\n\nThe term \"Ashkenazi mutation carriers\" does not directly refer to a disease, but rather to a group of individuals who carry a genetic mutation that increases their risk of developing certain diseases, including breast and ovarian cancer. Therefore, it is not considered a \"Disease\" entity in this context.\n\nThe \"BRCA1 locus\" refers to the location of the BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17, which is associated with an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Therefore, it is a \"Disease\" entity in this context."},
