Influx refers to the flow of a substance, in this case, extracellular Ca2 +, into a cell or organism.\n2. Ca2 + transients are temporary increases in intracellular calcium ion (Ca2 +) concentrations.\n3. L-type Ca2 + channel is a type of ion channel that is specific for the passage of calcium ions (Ca2 +).\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the processes and structures that are involved in the regulation of calcium ion flow into the cell, which can be related to various diseases such as cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, and cancer."},

Influx refers to the flow of a substance, in this case, extracellular Ca2 +, into a cell or organism, which can be related to various diseases such as inflammatory disorders.\n2. Ca2 + transients are temporary increases in intracellular calcium ion (Ca2 +) concentrations, which can be associated with various diseases such as cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, and cancer.\n\nI removed \"L-type Ca2 + channel\" from the list as it is not directly related to disease, but rather a structure that regulates calcium ion flow."},
