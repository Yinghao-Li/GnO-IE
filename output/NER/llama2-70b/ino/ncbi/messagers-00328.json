BRCA1 is a gene that is associated with an increased risk of certain diseases, including breast and ovarian cancer.\n2. Mutations in the BRCA1 gene can cause disease.\n3. Families with disease due to BRCA1 have members who have been diagnosed with a disease caused by a mutation in the BRCA1 gene.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the BRCA1 gene, mutations in the BRCA1 gene, and families with disease caused by BRCA1 mutations."},
