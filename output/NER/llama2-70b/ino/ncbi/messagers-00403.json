DM (Disease) - DM refers to Myotonic Dystrophy, a genetic disorder that affects muscle strength and function.\n2. RNAs (Disease) - RNAs from the expanded allele are implicated in the pathogenesis of DM.\n3. CUG repeats (Disease) - CUG repeats are a type of RNA repeat expansion that is associated with DM.\n4. Gain-of-function mutation (Disease) - A gain-of-function mutation is a type of mutation that results in the production of a protein with increased activity, which can lead to disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are: DM, RNAs, CUG repeats, and gain-of-function mutation."},
