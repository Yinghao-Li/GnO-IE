Codon 82 (Glu) of NPII\n\nThese entities are all related to the genetic disorder that the affected individuals in the family are experiencing. The nonsense mutation is a change in the DNA sequence that results in a premature stop codon, which can lead to a truncated or incomplete protein. The G to T transition is the specific type of mutation that occurs at nucleotide 2101 in exon 3 of the gene. The stop signal is the result of the premature stop codon, which can cause the protein to be non-functional. Codon 82 (Glu) of NPII is the specific codon that is affected by the mutation, leading to the production of a non-functional protein."},
