CDK4 gene mutation\n\nExplanation:\n\n* p16 germline mutations are genetic mutations that occur in the p16 gene and are inherited from one's parents. They are associated with various diseases, including cancer.\n* CDK4 gene mutation refers to a genetic alteration in the CDK4 gene, which can also contribute to the development of cancer.\n\nTherefore, both p16 germline mutations and CDK4 gene mutation can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},
