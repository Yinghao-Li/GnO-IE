Missense mutations are a type of genetic mutation that can lead to a change in the structure or function of a protein. In this paragraph, missense mutations are mentioned as the cause of a spectrum of human congenital eye malformations.\n2. Congenital eye malformations refer to abnormalities in the development of the eye that occur during fetal development. In this paragraph, congenital eye malformations are mentioned as the effect of missense mutations in the PAX6 paired domain.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Missense mutations and Congenital eye malformations."},
