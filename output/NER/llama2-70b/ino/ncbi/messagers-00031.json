Reduced expressivity\n\nExplanation:\n\n* A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of an organism, and it can cause a disease or disorder. In this paragraph, a mutation is detected in constitutional DNA, which means it is a genetic mutation that is present in every cell of the body.\n* Reduced expressivity is a term used to describe a condition where the effect of a gene or genetic mutation is less severe than expected. In this paragraph, one of the mutations detected is known to be associated with reduced expressivity. This means that the mutation has a less severe effect on the individual than might be expected.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the mutation and reduced expressivity."},

Reduced expressivity\n\nThe term \"constitutional DNA\" is not directly related to disease, so it has been removed from the list.\n\nThe two entities that clearly refer to disease are:\n\n1. Mutation - a change in the DNA sequence that can cause a disease or disorder\n2.
