Identify the names of the diseases mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n* generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa\n* junctional epidermolysis bullosa\n\n2. Check if these names correspond to disease entities in the ontology:\n\n* generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa: Yes, it is a disease entity\n* junctional epidermolysis bullosa: Yes, it is a disease entity\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa\n2. junctional epidermolysis bullosa"},
