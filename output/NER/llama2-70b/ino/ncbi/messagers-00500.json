Pendred syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the thyroid gland and is characterized by thyroid nodules, goiter, and hearing loss. It is considered a disease entity.\n2. Compound heterozygotes refer to individuals who have two different mutations in the same gene, one inherited from each parent. In this paragraph, the individuals are compound heterozygotes for L236P and T416P mutations.\n3. L236P and T416P are both mutations in the Pendred syndrome gene (PDS). They are disease-causing mutations that contribute to the development of Pendred syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are Pendred syndrome, compound heterozygotes, L236P, and T416P."},
