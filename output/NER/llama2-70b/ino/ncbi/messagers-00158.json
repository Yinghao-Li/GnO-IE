Identify the abnormalities mentioned in the paragraph:\n * Reduced size\n * Failure to gastrulate\n * Abnormal visceral endoderm development\n2. Determine whether each abnormality is a disease or a symptom:\n * Reduced size: Symptom\n * Failure to gastrulate: Symptom\n * Abnormal visceral endoderm development: Symptom\n3. Identify the underlying disease or condition that is causing the symptoms:\n * The paragraph does not provide enough information to determine the underlying disease or condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the symptoms described, it is possible that the mutant embryos are suffering from a developmental disorder or genetic disease that affects embryonic development, such as a genetic mutation or environmental factor. Further research or information would be needed to determine the specific disease or condition."},
