In this case, the paragraph mentions two specific mutations, 1195delC and 1936delG.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the two genetic mutations, 1195delC and 1936delG, that are being detected in the probands using allele-specific PCR."},

The other entities mentioned in the paragraph (allele-specific PCR, probands, heterozygous, homozygous) are not directly related to disease, so they can be removed from the list of disease entities."},
