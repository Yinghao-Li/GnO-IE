Cys-282-->Tyr (C282Y)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of a gene, which can lead to a change in the function or structure of the protein encoded by that gene. In this paragraph, the mutation is specified as Cys-282-->Tyr (C282Y), which means that the amino acid cysteine (Cys) at position 282 in the protein sequence is replaced with tyrosine (Tyr).\n* Cys-282-->Tyr (C282Y) is a specific type of mutation that occurs in the gene product, which is a member of the major histocompatibility complex class I-like family. This mutation is found in 85% of patient chromosomes, indicating that it is a common mutation associated with a particular disease or condition."},
