    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n1. C6 gene mutations\n2. Compound heterozygote\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. C6 gene mutations: The paragraph mentions that the proband was found to have two C6 gene mutations, which suggests that the C6 gene is associated with a disease or disorder.\n2. Compound heterozygote: The paragraph states that the proband was a compound heterozygote for two C6 gene mutations, which means that the individual had two different mutations in the C6 gene, one inherited from each parent. This suggests that the presence of these mutations may be associated with a disease or disorder."},

Therefore, it has been removed from the list."},
