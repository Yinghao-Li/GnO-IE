G2 phase chromosomal radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM) is a disease caused by a mutation in the ATM gene.\n2. Heterozygous carriers of the ATM gene are individuals who have one copy of the mutated ATM gene and one normal copy, making them carriers of the disease.\n3. G2 phase chromosomal radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes is not a disease itself, but rather a diagnostic test used to detect carriers of the ATM gene mutation. The test measures the sensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes to radiation during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, which is increased in individuals with the ATM gene mutation."},
