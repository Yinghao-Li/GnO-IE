    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are the \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n(i) Aberrant splicing\n(ii) Premature termination codon\n(iii) Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay\n\nThese are all related to the processing of mRNA and the consequences of errors in that processing, but they are not necessarily diseases in the classical sense. Aberrant splicing and premature termination codons can be caused by genetic mutations, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is a cellular process that helps to regulate the levels of abnormal transcripts.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Aberrant splicing\n* Premature termination codon\n* Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay"},

Aberrant splicing is a broader term that can encompass a range of mRNA processing errors, but it is not a specific disease."},
