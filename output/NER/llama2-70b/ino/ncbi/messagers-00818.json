Iron overload is a condition where the body has too much iron, which can be harmful and cause damage to organs and tissues.\n2. Hepatic iron stores refer to the amount of iron stored in the liver.\n3. Liver biopsy specimens are samples of liver tissue that are taken for examination to diagnose or monitor liver diseases.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
