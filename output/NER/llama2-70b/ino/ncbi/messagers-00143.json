RB1 allele\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph mentions a mutation in the RB1 allele, which is a genetic alteration that can lead to disease. The RB1 gene is associated with retinoblastoma, a rare genetic disorder that causes tumors to develop in the retina. Therefore, the mention of the RB1 allele in the paragraph implies the possibility of retinoblastoma or other related diseases."},

Retinoblastoma\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe mention of the RB1 allele is still relevant, as it is associated with retinoblastoma, a rare genetic disorder that causes tumors to develop in the retina. Therefore, retinoblastoma is the only disease entity that can be clearly inferred from the paragraph."},
