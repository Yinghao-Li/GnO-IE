Identify the main topic of the paragraph: The paragraph is discussing genetic mutations and their association with certain diseases.\n2. Identify the specific diseases mentioned in the paragraph: The paragraph mentions two diseases:\na. Cerebellar degeneration\nb. Cellular features (which can be a disease or a symptom, depending on the context)\n3. Identify any other disease-related entities mentioned in the paragraph: The paragraph also mentions \"clinical phenotype,\" which refers to the physical or behavioral manifestations of a disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cerebellar degeneration\n2. Cellular features\n3. Clinical phenotype"},

Therefore, it's included in the table as a subordinate entity under cerebellar degeneration."}
