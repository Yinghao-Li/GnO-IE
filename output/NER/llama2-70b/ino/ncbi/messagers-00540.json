Unilateral tumors: This refers to the presence of a tumor in one side of the body, which is a disease or medical condition.\n2. Unaffected mutation carriers: This refers to individuals who carry a genetic mutation that causes a disease or medical condition, but do not exhibit any symptoms themselves. They are still at risk of passing the mutation on to their offspring, and are therefore considered to be disease entities."},
