A-T heterozygotes\n\nExplanation: A-T heterozygotes are individuals who carry a mutated gene that causes ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and nervous system. A-T heterozygotes are carriers of the disease, meaning they have one copy of the mutated gene, but do not display symptoms themselves. The detection of A-T heterozygotes is important for genetic counseling and testing, as they have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to their offspring."},
