Identify the mention of a disease or disorder: \"MPS IVA\"\n3. Identify the mention of clinical phenotypes: \"severe\", \"intermediate\", \"mild\"\n\nBased on these mentions, we can identify the following \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph:\n\n1. MPS IVA (Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA) - a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the GALNS gene.\n2. Severe, intermediate, and mild clinical phenotypes - these are different forms of the disease, with varying levels of severity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. MPS IVA\n2. Severe MPS IVA\n3. Intermediate MPS IVA\n4. Mild MPS IVA"},
