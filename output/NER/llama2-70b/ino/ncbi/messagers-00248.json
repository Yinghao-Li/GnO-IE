Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a disease that is characterized by a combination of ataxia and telangiectasia. It is mentioned in the paragraph as a single entity, but it is still a disease.\n\nTherefore, the three \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ataxia\n2. Telangiectasia\n3.

Telangiectasia is a disease that affects the blood vessels and causes them to become enlarged and fragile.\n\nThe entity \"Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T)\" is not included in the revised list because it is not a separate disease entity, but rather a combination of two diseases (ataxia and telangiectasia)."},
