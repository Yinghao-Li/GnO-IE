    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Adrenoleukodystrophy\n2. Codon 291 deletion\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Adrenoleukodystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is a type of leukodystrophy, which refers to a group of genetic disorders that affect the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. Adrenoleukodystrophy is caused by a mutation in the ABCD1 gene, which codes for an enzyme involved in the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids.\n* Codon 291 deletion refers to a specific type of mutation in the ABCD1 gene that results in the deletion of a codon (a sequence of three nucleotides) at position 291. This mutation leads to the production of a truncated form of the ALDH7A1 enzyme, which is unable to function properly.\n\nTherefore, both Adrenoleukodystrophy and Codon 291 deletion can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},
