Tumors: The paragraph mentions that the missense mutation co-segregated with patients who had tumors. Therefore, tumors are a disease entity in this context.\n2. Predisposing mutation: The paragraph also mentions that the missense mutation was predicted to carry the predisposing mutation. This implies that the predisposing mutation is a disease-causing mutation that increases the risk of developing tumors. Therefore, predisposing mutation is also a disease entity in this context."},
