Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of diseases that are characterized by blistering and skin fragility, and can be caused by mutations in several genes, including COL17A1.\n\nTherefore, both \"generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa\" and \"epidermolysis bullosa\" can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},
