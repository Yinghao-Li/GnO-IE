Gastrulation defect\n\nExplanation: Gastrulation is a critical stage in embryonic development where the embryo undergoes a series of complex cellular movements and transformations to form the three primary layers of cells: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. A gastrulation defect refers to any abnormality or disruption in this process, which can result in developmental abnormalities or birth defects. In the context of the paragraph, the gastrulation defect is the condition that the researchers are trying to rescue using the aggregation of mutant Smad4 ES cells with wild-type tetraploid morulae."},
