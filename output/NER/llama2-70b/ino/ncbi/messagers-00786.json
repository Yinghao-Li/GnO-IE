Identify the population(s) in which these defects have been found:\n * 879delG: Cape (a region in South Africa) and hitherto unreported\n * 1195delC and 1936delG: African-Americans\n\nBased on the information provided, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. C6 deficiency\n2. 879delG\n3. 1195delC\n4. 1936delG\n\nThese are the molecular defects that have been identified in the C6 gene and are associated with disease in certain populations."},
