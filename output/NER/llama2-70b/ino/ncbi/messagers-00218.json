Aberrant transcripts\n\nThe term \"aberrant transcripts\" refers to abnormal or defective RNA transcripts that can result from genetic mutations or other cellular errors. In the context of the paragraph, the formation of aberrant transcripts is a consequence of the acceptor splice site mutation, which suggests that the mutation may be disease-causing. Therefore, \"aberrant transcripts\" can be considered a \"Disease\" entity in this context."},
