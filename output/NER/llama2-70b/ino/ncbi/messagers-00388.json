HFE (Hemochromatosis protein)\n\nHemochromatosis is a disease caused by a mutation in the HFE gene, which codes for the HFE protein. The HFE protein interacts with the transferrin receptor, which is involved in iron uptake and recycling in the body. The paragraph discusses the crystal structure of the HFE protein and its interaction with the transferrin receptor, which is relevant to understanding the molecular basis of hemochromatosis."},
