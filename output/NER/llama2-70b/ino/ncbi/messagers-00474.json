Premature protein truncation\n\nThese are all disease-causing entities because they disrupt the normal functioning of genes and proteins, leading to negative consequences for the organism. Mutations can alter the DNA sequence and lead to changes in the structure and function of proteins, which can cause disease. Exon skipping and premature protein truncation are both consequences of mutations that can lead to the production of abnormal or incomplete proteins, which can also cause disease."},
