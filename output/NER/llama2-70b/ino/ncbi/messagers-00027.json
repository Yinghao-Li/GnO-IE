In this paragraph, the tumors are being studied to detect mutations.\n* LOH (Loss of Heterozygosity) is a condition where a cell loses its normal diploidy, meaning it has only one copy of a particular gene instead of two. This can lead to the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, which can contribute to the development of cancer. In this paragraph, LOH is mentioned as a characteristic of the tumors being studied."},
