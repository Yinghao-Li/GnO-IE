Meningococcal meningitis\n\nExplanation:\n\n* C9 deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system's ability to fight infections.\n* Meningococcal meningitis is a serious bacterial infection that can cause inflammation of the protective membranes (meninges) that cover the brain and spinal cord.\n\nTherefore, meningococcal meningitis is the disease that the four Japanese patients suffered from, and it is the disease that the study aimed to understand at a molecular level."},
