Functionally hemizygous patients refer to individuals who have a genetic disorder or disease caused by a mutation in a gene that is present in only one copy in their genome, either because of a deletion or a mutation in one of the two copies.\n2. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of an individual's genome that can cause a genetic disorder or disease.\n3. Phenotype categories are groups of physical or behavioral characteristics that are used to classify individuals based on their physical or behavioral traits, which can be affected by genetic mutations. In this context, the mutations in the patients' genes have led to certain phenotypic characteristics that have been grouped into four arbitrary categories."},
