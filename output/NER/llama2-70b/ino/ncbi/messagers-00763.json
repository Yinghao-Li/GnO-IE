Direct sequence analysis - a method used to determine the order of nucleotides in a DNA sequence.\n4. CPO gene - a gene that codes for a protein involved in mitochondrial function.\n5. Nucleotide position 85 - a specific location in the CPO gene where a genetic variation has been identified.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph are:\n\n1. CPO gene\n2.
