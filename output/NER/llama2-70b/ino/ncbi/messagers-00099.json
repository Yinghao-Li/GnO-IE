Sporadic prostate cancer is a type of cancer that occurs randomly and is not inherited from family members. It is a disease that affects the prostate gland and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men.\n2. PTEN/MMAC1 is a gene that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and division. Mutations in this gene have been associated with various types of cancer, including prostate cancer.\n3. 10q loss refers to the loss of a portion of chromosome 10, which is a common genetic alteration found in many types of cancer, including prostate cancer."},
