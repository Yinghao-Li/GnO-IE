Angelman syndrome (AS)\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"PWS infants\" and \"Angelman syndrome,\" which are both diseases. Prader-Willi syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the loss of function of genes on chromosome 15, while Angelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the loss of function of the UBE3A gene. The paragraph suggests that mice with a larger deletion involving both Snrpn and the putative PWS-IC lack expression of imprinted genes and manifest several phenotypes common to PWS infants, which implies that the deletion may be associated with PWS or AS. Therefore, both PWS and AS can be considered \"Disease\" entities in this paragraph."},
