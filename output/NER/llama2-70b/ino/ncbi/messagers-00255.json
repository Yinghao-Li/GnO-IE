Severely affected myotonic dystrophy patients\n\nThe paragraph mentions the DMPK gene being hypermethylated in patients with severe myotonic dystrophy, which suggests that myotonic dystrophy is the disease being referred to. Additionally, the phrase \"severely affected myotonic dystrophy patients\" also implies that myotonic dystrophy is the disease being discussed. Therefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are myotonic dystrophy and severely affected myotonic dystrophy patients."},
