However, we can identify the following entity as a potential disease-related term:\n\n* \"alpha carbonic anhydrase gene\" - This term refers to a gene that is associated with a medical condition, specifically a genetic disorder called carbonic anhydrase deficiency.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph are:\n\n* Carbonic anhydrase deficiency\n\nNote that this is a genetic disorder, not a disease caused by a pathogen or other external factor."},
