Classical ataxia-telangiectasia (classical AT)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM) is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, and immunodeficiency.\n* Classical ataxia-telangiectasia (classical AT) is a term used to describe patients with ATM mutations who have the full clinical spectrum of the disorder, including progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, and immunodeficiency.\n\nTherefore, both ATM and classical AT can be classified as \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph."},
