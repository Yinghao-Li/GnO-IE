Identify the main entities in the paragraph:\n * Mutations\n * Gene (WFS1)\n * Protein\n * Affected individuals\n * Families\n * Disease phenotype\n2. Determine which entities are related to the disease:\n * Mutations: Yes, they are associated with the disease phenotype\n * Gene (WFS1): Yes, it encodes a protein that is associated with the disease phenotype\n * Protein: Yes, it is associated with the disease phenotype\n * Affected individuals: Yes, they have the disease\n * Families: No, families are not directly related to the disease, but they are mentioned as a way to identify the affected individuals\n * Disease phenotype: Yes, it is the outcome or symptoms of the disease\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mutations\n2. Gene (WFS1)\n3. Protein\n4. Disease phenotype\n\nThese entities are all related to the disease that is being discussed in the paragraph."},
