AGU is a disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aguaglutinin.\n2. Autosomal recessive trait refers to the inheritance pattern of the disease, where an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease.\n3. Founder effect refers to the phenomenon where a small group of individuals with a particular gene mutation establishes a population, leading to a higher frequency of the mutation in the population than in the general population. In this case, the founder effect is the reason for the high frequency of AGU in Finland."},
