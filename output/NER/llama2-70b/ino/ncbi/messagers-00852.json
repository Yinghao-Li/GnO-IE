    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n1. The maternal mutation 459 + 1G > A\n2. The novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8\n3. The substitution of alanine 464 by valine (A464V)\n\nThese three entities are all related to the genetic mutations that are being described in the paragraph, and they are all potential causes of disease. The maternal mutation and the novel cytosine to thymidine transition are both genetic changes that could lead to disease, and the substitution of alanine 464 by valine is a specific amino acid change that could also have disease-causing potential."},

The substitution of alanine 464 by valine (A464V)\n\nThese two entities are the ones that are most directly related to the disease being described in the paragraph. The novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8 is also a genetic change, but it is not explicitly stated to be a disease-causing mutation."},
