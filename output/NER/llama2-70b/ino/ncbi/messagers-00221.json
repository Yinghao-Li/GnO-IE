Abnormally spliced transcript: The paragraph mentions an abnormally spliced transcript that contains an extra 264 bases upstream from exon 32. This abnormal splicing event could potentially lead to a disease or disorder, as it alters the normal splicing pattern of the gene.\n2. Premature termination codon: The paragraph also mentions a premature termination codon 27 bp downstream from the cryptic splice site. This premature termination codon could potentially lead to a disease or disorder, as it can cause a truncated protein or a non-functional protein, which can disrupt normal cellular processes."},

Premature termination codon\n\nThe entity \"abnormally spliced transcript\" is not directly related to disease, as it is a molecular event that can have various consequences, including disease. However, the premature termination codon that is mentioned in the context of the abnormally spliced transcript is a clear indicator of disease, as it can lead to a truncated or non-functional protein that disrupts normal cellular processes."},
