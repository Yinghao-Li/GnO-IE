Cell-surface expression\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. HFE is a gene that is associated with Hereditary Hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb and process iron.\n2. Beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) is a protein that is involved in the immune system and is associated with certain diseases, including kidney disease and some types of cancer.\n3. Cell-surface expression refers to the ability of a protein or other molecule to be expressed on the surface of a cell, where it can interact with other molecules or cells.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the Hereditary Hemochromatosis gene (HFE), the protein beta2-microglobulin (beta2m), and the concept of cell-surface expression."},
