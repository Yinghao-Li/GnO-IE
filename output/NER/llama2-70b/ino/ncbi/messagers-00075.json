Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb and process iron, leading to iron accumulation in organs and tissues. It is a disease caused by a genetic mutation.\n2. Homozygosity refers to the presence of two identical alleles of a gene in an individual, one inherited from each parent. In the context of HH, homozygosity for the Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene is associated with the development of the disease.\n3. Cys282Tyr mutation is a specific genetic mutation that occurs in the HFE gene, which codes for a protein involved in iron metabolism. This mutation is associated with the development of HH.\n4. HFE gene is a gene that codes for a protein involved in iron metabolism. Mutations in this gene, such as the Cys282Tyr mutation, can lead to the development of HH."},
