Mutant alleles: The paragraph mentions mutant alleles, which are versions of a gene that contain a mutation.\n3. Founder population: The paragraph suggests that the mutant alleles were likely to be identical by descent for a mutation in the founder population, which refers to a group of individuals who are the ancestors of a particular population.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
