Identify the clinical features or symptoms mentioned in the paragraph:\n * coronal synostosis\n * brachycephaly\n * low frontal hairline\n * facial asymmetry\n * ptosis\n * hypertelorism\n * broad great toes\n * clinodactyly\n2. Determine which of these features are diseases or medical conditions:\n * coronal synostosis: disease\n * brachycephaly: disease\n * facial asymmetry: disease\n * ptosis: disease\n * hypertelorism: disease\n * clinodactyly: disease\n3. Exclude any features that are not diseases or medical conditions:\n * low frontal hairline (not a disease)\n * broad great toes (not a disease)\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
