Phenotypic heterogeneity refers to the presence of different physical or behavioral characteristics in individuals within a family or population, which can be indicative of a disease or disorder.\n2. ARSA mutations are genetic changes that can lead to diseases or disorders, in this case, they are the molecular basis of intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Phenotypic heterogeneity\n* ARSA mutations"},
