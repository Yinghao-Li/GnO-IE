Here are the entities in the paragraph that can be classified as \"Disease\" entities:\n\n1. \"constitutive methylation\" - This is a disease entity because it describes an abnormal methylation pattern in a specific region of DNA.\n2. \"CTG repeat\" - This is a disease entity because it is a repetitive DNA sequence that is associated with a disease, specifically myotonic dystrophy.\n3. \"normal individuals\" - This is a disease entity because it is used as a reference point to compare the methylation patterns of patients with a disease.\n4. \"patients\" - This is a disease entity because it refers to individuals who have a disease, specifically myotonic dystrophy.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* constitutive methylation\n* CTG repeat\n* normal individuals\n* patients"},
