Hemochromatosis\n\nHemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb and process iron, leading to excessive iron accumulation in the body's tissues and organs. It is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which codes for a protein involved in iron metabolism. The two mutations mentioned in the paragraph, 845 G - > A and 187 C - > G, are both associated with hemochromatosis.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Hemochromatosis\n* 845 G - > A mutation\n* 187 C - > G mutation"},
