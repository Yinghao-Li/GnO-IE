They are mentioned in the context of genetic heterogeneity and penetrance analysis, which suggests that they are being studied in relation to their role in the development or progression of breast cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Breast cancer, BRCA1, and BRCA2."},
