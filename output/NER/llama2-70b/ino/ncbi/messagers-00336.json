Identify the entities mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n* horizontal eye movements\n* visually guided saccades\n* antisaccades\n* smooth pursuit\n* control subjects\n* patients\n* autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias\n* type I spinocerebellar ataxias\n* SCA1\n* SCA2\n* SCA3\n* Machado-Joseph disease\n2. Determine which of these entities are diseases:\n\n* Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias\n* Type I spinocerebellar ataxias\n* SCA1\n* SCA2\n* SCA3\n* Machado-Joseph disease\n\nAll of these entities are diseases, so they can be classified as \"Disease\" entities.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias\n* Type I spinocerebellar ataxias\n* SCA1\n* SCA2\n* SCA3\n* Machado-Joseph disease"},

Let me know if you have any further questions."}
