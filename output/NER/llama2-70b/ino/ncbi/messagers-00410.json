FNDI (Familial Neurodegenerative Disease with Involuntary Movements)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* FNDI is a disease that affects the nervous system and is characterized by involuntary movements. It is the primary disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nThe mention of AVP-NPII is relevant to the study of FNDI, but it is not a disease entity itself. Therefore, I have removed it from the list of disease entities."},
