Control individuals: These are individuals who do not have the disease or condition being studied. They are used as a comparison group to contrast with individuals who have the disease or condition.\n2. Homozygous: This refers to an individual who has two copies of a particular gene, one inherited from each parent. In the context of the paragraph, the individual is homozygous for the glycine substitution, meaning they have two copies of the gene with the substitution.\n3. Glycine substitution: This refers to a specific genetic change in which the amino acid glycine is replaced by another amino acid. In the context of the paragraph, the glycine substitution is associated with the disease or condition being studied."},
