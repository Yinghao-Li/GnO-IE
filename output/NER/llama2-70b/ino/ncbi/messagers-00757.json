I1307K polymorphism is a genetic variation that has been associated with an increased risk of certain diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders.\n2. Ashkenazi Jewish origins refers to the ethnic group that has a higher frequency of certain genetic diseases, such as Tay-Sachs disease, Gaucher disease, and cystic fibrosis.\n\nTherefore, both I1307K polymorphism and Ashkenazi Jewish origins can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},

The I1307K polymorphism, on the other hand, has been associated with an increased risk of certain diseases, making it a relevant \"Disease\" entity in the context of the paragraph."},
