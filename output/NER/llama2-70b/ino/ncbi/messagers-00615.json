Identify the names of the conditions mentioned in the paragraph:\n * aniridia\n * Peters anomaly\n * autosomal dominant keratitis\n * familial foveal dysplasia\n2. Check each name against a reliable source, such as a medical dictionary or a list of known diseases, to confirm that they are indeed diseases.\n3. Once confirmed, list the diseases as \"Disease\" entities:\n 1. Aniridia\n 2. Peters anomaly\n 3. Autosomal dominant keratitis\n 4.
