Disease-associated haplotypes refer to specific genetic variations that are associated with an increased risk of developing a particular disease. In this context, the phrase \"disease-associated haplotypes\" implies that the genetic variations being studied are linked to a specific disease.\n2. WFS gene refers to the Wolfram syndrome gene, which is a gene that is associated with a rare genetic disorder called Wolfram syndrome. The paragraph mentions that the WFS gene was localized to a specific genomic region using meiotic recombinants and disease-associated haplotypes.\n\nTherefore, the two \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Disease-associated haplotypes\n2. Wolfram syndrome (WFS gene)"},
