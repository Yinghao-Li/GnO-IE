Mutations in these genes can be pathogenic, meaning that they can cause disease. In the paragraph, the authors mention that all the patients carried a pathogenic mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, indicating that these genes are the disease entities being discussed."},

Ovarian cancer\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhile BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that are associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, they are not diseases themselves. The paragraph mentions that the patients carried a pathogenic mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, which increases their risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Therefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are breast cancer and ovarian cancer."},
