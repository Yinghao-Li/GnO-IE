Exon 21\n\nThese entities are related to the disease because they are involved in the genetic mutation that causes the disease. The missense mutation is a change in the DNA sequence that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into a protein, which can disrupt the protein's normal function and lead to disease. The specific amino acid change, from cysteine (Cys) to arginine (Arg), and the location of the mutation in exon 21, are also important for understanding the disease mechanism. The nucleotide position 28 refers to the specific location in the DNA sequence where the mutation occurs."},
