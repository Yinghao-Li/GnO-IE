The study used proband fibroblasts, which are cells that have been taken from a patient with a specific genetic disorder or disease. In this case, the disease is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that the patient has a genetic disorder that affects the processing and secretion of the alpha-subunit.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. The genetic disorder or disease that affects the processing and secretion of the alpha-subunit.\n2. The patient from whom the proband fibroblasts were taken.\n\nThe paragraph does not provide a specific name for the disease, but it suggests that it is a genetic disorder that affects the processing and secretion of the alpha-subunit."},
