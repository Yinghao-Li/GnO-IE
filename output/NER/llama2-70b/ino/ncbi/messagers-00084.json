Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus\n\nThis is a type of diabetes insipidus that is caused by a genetic mutation and affects the nervous system. It is characterized by excessive thirst and urination, and is usually caused by a defect in the production or release of the hormone vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone).\n\n2. Missense mutation encoding Gly23 - > Val in neurophysin II\n\nThis is a genetic mutation that affects the protein neurophysin II, which is involved in the production and release of vasopressin. The mutation substitutes a valine residue for a glycine residue at position 23 in the neurophysin II protein, leading to a change in its structure and function. This mutation is associated with the development of autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus."},
