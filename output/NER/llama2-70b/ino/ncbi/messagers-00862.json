Arg226Stop\n\nExplanation:\n\n* MLH1 mutation refers to a genetic alteration in the MLH1 gene.\n* Homozygous MLH1 mutation means that both copies of the MLH1 gene have the same mutation, one inherited from each parent.\n* Arg226Stop is a specific type of MLH1 mutation that results in a premature stop codon at position 226 of the protein sequence, leading to a truncated protein.\n\nTherefore, the three entities in the paragraph that relate to disease are:\n\n1. MLH1 mutation\n2. Homozygous MLH1 mutation\n3. Arg226Stop"},
