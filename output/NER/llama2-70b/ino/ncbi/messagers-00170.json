It is caused by an expansion of a CCTG repeat in the DMPK gene, which leads to a variety of symptoms including muscle weakness, muscle wasting, and muscle stiffness. The paragraph discusses the progression of somatic CTG repeat length heterogeneity in the blood cells of myotonic dystrophy patients, which suggests that the disease is the focus of the discussion. Therefore, \"myotonic dystrophy\" can be identified as the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph."},
