Alzheimer's disease (ALD)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Alzheimer's disease (ALD) is a specific neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and synaptic loss, leading to cognitive decline and memory impairment. It is clearly mentioned in the paragraph as a possible disease that PET can detect.\n\nThe mention of \"neuronal degeneration\" is not specific enough to be considered a distinct disease entity, as it can refer to various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the revised list only includes Alzheimer's disease (ALD) as a \"Disease\" entity."},
