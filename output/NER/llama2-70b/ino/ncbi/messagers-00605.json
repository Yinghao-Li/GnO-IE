    {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this paragraph, the \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n1. Mutation\n2. Homozygous\n3. Heterozygous\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Mutation: A change in the DNA sequence of a gene that can lead to a change in the function or structure of the protein it encodes. In this paragraph, the mutation is mentioned as the cause of the disease.\n2. Homozygous: A genetic condition where an individual has two copies of the same allele (either both normal or both mutated) for a particular gene. In this paragraph, the patients are described as homozygous for the mutation in exon 4, meaning they have two copies of the mutated allele.\n3. Heterozygous: A genetic condition where an individual has two different alleles for a particular gene, one inherited from each parent. In this paragraph, the parents of patient 2 are described as heterozygous, meaning they have one normal and one mutated allele for the gene in question."},
