It is a change in the DNA sequence that results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein that may not function properly."},

C9 deficiency\n\nThe nonsense substitution (CGA -> TGA) at codon 95 in exon 4 is a genetic mutation that causes C9 deficiency, but it is not a disease entity itself. Therefore, the only disease entity in the paragraph is C9 deficiency."},
