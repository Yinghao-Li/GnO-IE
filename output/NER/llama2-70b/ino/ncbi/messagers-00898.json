Emerin\n\nExplanation:\n\n* EDMD is a disease that affects the muscular system and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting.\n* Lamin B1 is a protein that is involved in the structure and function of nuclear lamina, which provides mechanical support to the nucleus and regulates various cellular processes.\n* Emerin is another protein that is involved in the structure and function of nuclear lamina.\n\nThe paragraph suggests that the absence of lamin B1 and emerin in heart and skeletal muscle nuclei may contribute to the particular susceptibility of these tissues to damage in EDMD. Therefore, all three entities are relevant to the disease being discussed."},

Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD)\n\nThe paragraph discusses the role of lamin B1 and emerin in the pathophysiology of EDMD, which is a type of muscular dystrophy that affects the muscular system and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. Therefore, EDMD is the only disease entity that is clearly mentioned in the paragraph."},
