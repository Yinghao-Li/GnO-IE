To identify the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph, we can look for keywords or phrases that indicate a medical condition or disorder.\n\n1. \"DMS\" - This is likely a disease or disorder, so we can identify it as a \"Disease\" entity.\n2. \"sexual ambiguity\" - This is a symptom or characteristic that may be associated with a disease or disorder, so we can identify it as a \"Disease\" entity.\n3. \"male phenotype\" - This is a term that refers to the physical characteristics of an individual, and may be associated with a disease or disorder, so we can identify it as a \"Disease\" entity.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
