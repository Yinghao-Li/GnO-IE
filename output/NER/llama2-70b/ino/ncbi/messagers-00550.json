Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder caused by the loss of function of certain genes on chromosome 15. It is characterized by a range of symptoms including intellectual disability, obesity, and behavioral problems.\n2. Deletion refers to the absence or removal of a segment of DNA, which can lead to the loss of function of genes and contribute to the development of genetic disorders like PWS.\n\nTherefore, both PWS and deletion can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},
