DMPK [ - / - ] knockout mice: DMPK stands for \"dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase.\" DMPK is a protein that is associated with myotonic dystrophy, a genetic disorder that affects muscle function. The [ - / - ] knockout mice in the paragraph are mice that have been genetically engineered to lack the DMPK gene, which is used as a model to study the role of DMPK in muscle function and disease.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n* DMPK\n* Myotonic dystrophy\n\nI hope this helps!
