VHL-negative RCC cancer cells\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of kidney cancer.\n* VHL-negative RCC cancer cells are cancer cells that do not have a functional VHL gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene that helps regulate cell growth and division. The absence of the VHL gene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of cancer.\n\nTherefore, both RCC and VHL-negative RCC cancer cells can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of kidney cancer, which is a disease.\n\nThe other entity mentioned in the paragraph, \"VHL-negative RCC cancer cells,\" does not directly refer to a disease, but rather to a characteristic of cancer cells that can contribute to the development of disease.
