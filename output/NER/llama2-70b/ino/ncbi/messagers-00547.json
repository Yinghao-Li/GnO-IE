    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)\n2. Maternal disomy 15\n3. Trisomy 15\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder caused by the loss of function of the Prader-Willi gene, which is located on chromosome 15. It is characterized by a range of symptoms including intellectual disability, obesity, and behavioral problems.\n2. Maternal disomy 15 refers to a condition where a person has two copies of chromosome 15 from their mother, instead of one copy from each parent. This can occur due to a genetic error during meiosis, the process by which gametes (sperm or egg cells) are formed.\n3. Trisomy 15 is a condition where a person has three copies of chromosome 15, instead of the usual two copies. This can occur due to a genetic error during meiosis or mitosis, the process by which cells divide. Trisomy 15 is often associated with severe developmental delays, intellectual disability, and other health problems.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Prader-Willi syndrome, maternal disomy 15, and trisomy 15."},
