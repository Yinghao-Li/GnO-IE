    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Late infantile patient\n2. Frequent 0-type mutation 459 + 1G > A\n3. Novel, single basepair microdeletion of guanine at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 (7delG)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Late infantile patient: This refers to a patient who is in the late stages of infancy, which is a stage of human development that typically lasts from 6 to 12 months.\n2. Frequent 0-type mutation 459 + 1G > A: This refers to a genetic mutation that occurs frequently in the patient's genome. The \"0-type\" refers to the type of mutation, which in this case is a point mutation (a change in a single nucleotide). The \"459 + 1G > A\" refers to the specific location of the mutation, which is at nucleotide 459 + 1 in the genome, and the change from a guanine (G) to an adenine (A).\n3. Novel, single basepair microdeletion of guanine at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 (7delG): This refers to a genetic mutation that is new or novel, and is characterized by the deletion of a single base pair (a guanine) at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 of the genome. Exon 1 is a region of the genome that contains a gene that is involved in the development or function of a particular protein. The deletion of a single base pair can result in a change in the function or structure of the protein, leading to disease."},
