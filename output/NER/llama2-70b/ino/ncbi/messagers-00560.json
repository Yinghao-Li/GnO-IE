Contractures\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by a combination of symptoms, including campomelia (a condition where the limbs are abnormally short and deformed), skeletal dysplasia (abnormal development of the skeleton), contractures (permanent shortening of muscles or tendons), and early death.\n* Campomelia is a condition that is characterized by abnormally short and deformed limbs.\n* Skeletal dysplasia is a condition where the skeleton does not develop properly, leading to abnormal growth and development of the bones.\n* Contractures are permanent shortenings of muscles or tendons that can cause joints to become fixed in a bent or straight position.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS), campomelia, skeletal dysplasia, and contractures."},
