G301C is a genetic variation that is associated with a higher risk of developing certain diseases, such as Fabry disease.\n2. GALNS gene is a gene that is associated with Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder.\n\nTherefore, both G301C and GALNS gene can be considered \"Disease\" entities in the context of the paragraph."},
