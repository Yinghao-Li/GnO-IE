Disease: The disease is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but based on the context, it can be inferred that the paragraph is discussing clinical manifestations of a specific disease.\n2. Neurological dysfunction: This term refers to impairment or malfunctioning of the nervous system. It could be a symptom or a manifestation of a neurological disorder or disease.\n3. Acute attacks: This term refers to a sudden onset or worsening of symptoms. It could be a characteristic feature of certain diseases, such as seizures or migraines.\n4. Drugs: While not a disease itself, the use of certain drugs can cause or exacerbate various diseases, such as allergic reactions, toxicity, or side effects.\n5. Fasting: Fasting can be a cause of certain diseases, such as ketoacidosis in diabetes or Reye's syndrome in children. It can also be a symptom of other conditions, such as anorexia nervosa.\n6. Cyclical hormonal changes: Hormonal imbalances or changes can be a cause of various diseases, such as menstrual cramps, premenstrual syndrome, or polycystic ovary syndrome.\n7. Infectious diseases: Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites. They can affect various organs and systems in the body, including the nervous system.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph discusses a disease that causes neurological dysfunction, which can be precipitated by drugs, fasting, cyclical hormonal changes, or infectious diseases."},
