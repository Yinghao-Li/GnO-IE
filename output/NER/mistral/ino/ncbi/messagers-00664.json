It is a genetic condition characterized by progressive degeneration of the nervous system. The Friedreich ataxia premutation carrier refers to an individual who carries the mutated FRDA gene but does not exhibit the full symptoms of the disease.\n\n2. Meiotic expansion: This term refers to the abnormal expansion of a specific genetic sequence (in this case, the FRDA gene) during meiosis, the process of cell division that produces gametes (sperm and eggs).\n\n3. Mitotic expansion: Similar to meiotic expansion, mitotic expansion refers to the abnormal expansion of a genetic sequence during mitosis, the process of cell division that results in the formation of new body cells.\n\n4. FRDA gene: This is the specific gene associated with Friedreich Ataxia. The abnormal expansion of this gene leads to the development of the disease."},
