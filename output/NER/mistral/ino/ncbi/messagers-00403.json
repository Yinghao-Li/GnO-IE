    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. DM: This is an abbreviation for a genetic disorder. The specific type of DM is not mentioned in the paragraph, but it can refer to various types of genetic muscle disorders, such as Myotonic Dystrophy or Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy.\n2. Expanded allele: This refers to a mutated gene that has an abnormal number of repeating sequences, leading to the development of a disease.\n3. RNAs: Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) is a type of nucleic acid that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of proteins. In this context, the RNAs are likely to be abnormally produced from the expanded allele.\n4. CUG repeats: CUG is a sequence of three nucleotides (C-U-G) that is repeated in the DNA or RNA of some genes. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the specific sequence that is the target of the inappropriate protein binding.\n5. Gain-of-function mutation: This is a type of genetic mutation where a gene produces a altered, abnormal protein that gains new or enhanced functions, leading to disease.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are: DM (Myotonic Dystrophy or other Muscular Dystrophies), Expanded allele (a mutated gene causing DM), and the specific RNA or protein resulting from the expanded allele that causes the gain-of-function mutation."},
