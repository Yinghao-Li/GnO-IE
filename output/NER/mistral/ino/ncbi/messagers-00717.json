Splice sites: Splice site mutations can lead to various genetic disorders, such as:\n   - Spliceosome-associated protein (SAP) diseases: Mutations in genes encoding spliceosome-associated proteins can result in impaired RNA splicing and various diseases, including:\n      * Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)\n      * Dyskeratosis congenita\n      * Retinitis pigmentosa\n      * Other inherited disorders\n   - Intron retention diseases: Mutations that cause the retention of introns in mature mRNA can lead to diseases, such as:\n      * Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB)\n      * Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)\n      * Other neuromuscular disorders\n   - Exon skipping diseases: Mutations that disrupt the correct exon skipping process can lead to diseases, such as:\n      * Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)\n      * Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)\n      - Other genetic disorders.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph discusses mutations affecting splice sites, which can lead to various genetic diseases."},
