    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Piebaldism: A genetic disorder characterized by the absence of melanin in patches of the skin and hair.\n2. Severe piebaldism: A more extreme form of piebaldism, which may also affect other body systems.\n3. Congenital sensorineural deafness: A type of hearing loss present at birth, caused by damage to the inner ear or nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain.\n4. Xhosa stock: A ethnic group from South Africa.\n5. KIT proto-oncogene: A gene that provides instructions for making a protein called tyrosine kinase, which plays a role in the development and function of blood cells.\n6. Missense substitution: A type of genetic mutation where a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence is changed, resulting in the substitution of one amino acid for another.\n7. R796G: A specific missense substitution, where the arginine (R) at position 796 in the KIT protein is replaced by glycine (G).\n8. Intracellular kinase domain: The part of the KIT protein that is located inside the cell and is responsible for catalyzing the addition of phosphate groups to other proteins.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are piebaldism and congenital sensorineural deafness."},
