HLA - B: HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) is a complex of proteins that plays a crucial role in the immune system. It is involved in the presentation of antigens to T cells and is associated with various diseases, including autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection. Therefore, HLA can be considered a disease or condition when it is associated with specific diseases or disorders. However, in this context, it is mentioned as a factor being studied, so it is not clear if any specific disease is being referred to. Therefore, it is best to leave it as an entity without specifying a particular disease."},
