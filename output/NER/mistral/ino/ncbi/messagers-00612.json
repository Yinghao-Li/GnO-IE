They refer to alterations in the DNA sequence that result in the premature termination of a protein's synthesis.\n2. Dominant-negative mutants: This term refers to a type of mutation that disrupts the normal function of a protein when only one copy of the gene is mutated. It does not cause a loss of function, but rather a gain of a new, abnormal function that interferes with the normal function of the wild-type protein. In this context, the dominant-negative mutants are not diseases, but rather the result of a specific type of mutation in the PAX6 gene.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph. However, it's important to note that truncation mutations and dominant-negative mutations can lead to various diseases depending on the specific gene and the function of the protein involved. In this case, the paragraph mentions that truncation mutations in the PAX6 gene result in dominant-negative mutants, but it does not specify what diseases, if any, are associated with these mutations."},
