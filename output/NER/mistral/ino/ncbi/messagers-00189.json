A - T heterozygotes: This term refers to individuals who carry a mutation in their DNA where one allele has an adenine (A) base and the other allele has a thymine (T) base at a specific location. This condition is not considered a disease per se, but it can be a marker for certain genetic disorders or increased susceptibility to certain diseases. However, it's important to note that being an A - T heterozygote is not a disease in itself, but rather a genetic variation."},
