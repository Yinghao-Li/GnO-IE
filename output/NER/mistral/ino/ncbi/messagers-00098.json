    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. PTEN: Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor gene. Mutations in the PTEN gene can lead to various diseases, including Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and various types of cancer such as breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and glioblastoma.\n\n2. MMAC1: MMAC1 (Milk Fat Globule-Epididymis Protein 3) is a gene that encodes for the protein HMGB1 (High Mobility Group Box 1). Mutations in the MMAC1 gene have been associated with various diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and certain types of cancer such as ovarian cancer and breast cancer.\n\n3. 10q23: 10q23 is a chromosomal location. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the 10q23 region is a genetic alteration that can be associated with various diseases, including certain types of cancer such as renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer."},
