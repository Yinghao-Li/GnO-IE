    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Total deficiency: This term is likely referring to a complete absence or dysfunction of a particular protein or enzyme due to a genetic defect. In this context, it's likely that the total deficiency is related to the C6 gene and its protein product.\n\n2. C6 gene: The C6 gene is a specific genetic entity that provides instructions for producing the C6 protein, which is a component of the complement system in the human body.\n\n3. 879delG: This is a molecular defect or mutation in the C6 gene. The \"delG\" indicates a deletion of a single guanine base in the gene.\n\n4. 1195delC: This is another molecular defect or mutation in the C6 gene. The \"delC\" indicates a deletion of a single cytosine base in the gene.\n\n5. 1936delG: This is yet another molecular defect or mutation in the C6 gene. The \"delG\" indicates a deletion of a single guanine base in the gene.\n\n6. Cape: This term is likely referring to a specific population or geographic region, but it's not directly related to a disease entity.\n\n7. African-Americans: This term refers to a specific population or ethnic group, but it's not directly related to a disease entity. However, the paragraph mentions that the 1195delC and 1936delG mutations have been previously reported in this population, suggesting that these mutations may be more common or relevant to this group."},
