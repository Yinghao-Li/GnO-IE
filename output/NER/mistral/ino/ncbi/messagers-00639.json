    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Classical familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) - This is the primary disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is a genetic condition that predisposes individuals to the development of numerous colorectal adenomas (benign growths in the colon or rectum) and carcinomas (malignant tumors) in the colon and rectum.\n2. Autosomal dominant disease - This is a type of inheritance pattern where a mutated gene in one copy of the DNA sequence is sufficient to cause the disease. It is mentioned as a characteristic feature of FAP.\n3. Hundreds or thousands of colorectal adenomas - This is a complication or symptom of FAP, referring to the large number of benign growths that can develop in the colon and rectum.\n4. Colorectal adenomas - These are benign growths in the colon or rectum, which can develop into malignant tumors if left untreated. They are a hallmark feature of FAP.\n5. Carcinoma - This is a type of cancer, specifically a malignant tumor that can develop in the colon or rectum. It is a potential complication of FAP.\n6. Truncating mutations - These are genetic mutations that result in the premature termination of the production of a protein. In the context of FAP, they refer to mutations in the APC gene that cause the disease.\n7. APC gene - This is the specific gene that is mutated in individuals with FAP, leading to the development of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas."},
