HFE gene: This is the specific gene that is associated with hemochromatosis. It is the gene that contains the identified mutations.\n3. Mutations: These are the changes in the DNA sequence of the HFE gene that result in the disease.\n4. C282Y: This is a specific mutation (amino acid substitution) in the HFE gene, identified as nucleotides 845 G - - > A.\n5. H63D: This is another specific mutation (amino acid substitution) in the HFE gene, identified as nucleotides 187 C - - > G.\n\nSo, the disease entity in the paragraph is hemochromatosis, and the specific genetic causes of the disease are the HFE gene mutations C282Y and H63D."},
