W427R: This is another missense mutation, where W represents a tryptophan and R represents an arginine.\n3. Q306X: This is a nonsense mutation, where Q represents a glutamine and X represents a stop codon.\n4. Q385X: This is another nonsense mutation, where Q represents a glutamine and X represents a stop codon.\n5. 662de14bp: This is a small deletion mutation, where 14 base pairs (bp) are deleted.\n6. 1168del3bp: This is another small deletion mutation, where 3 base pairs are deleted.\n7. removing a glycine at position 390: This is a description of the effect of the splicing mutation (IVS1 - 15c - > g), but the mutation itself is IVS1 - 15c - > g.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n1. G197W mutation\n2. W427R mutation\n3. Q306X mutation\n4. Q385X mutation\n5. 662de14bp mutation\n6. 1168del3bp mutation\n7.

The other entities in the paragraph (G197W, W427R, and 662de14bp) are missense mutations that describe the change in the DNA sequence, but they do not necessarily refer to specific diseases on their own."},
