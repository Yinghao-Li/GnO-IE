    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Major instability: This term refers to a condition where there are significant changes or variations in the genetic material from one generation to the next or within an individual. It could be a sign of various genetic disorders or diseases.\n2. High levels of somatic mosaicism: Somatic mosaicism is a condition where an individual has two or more distinct cell populations within their body, each with different genetic makeup. This can arise due to various genetic events during development, such as nondisjunction, mitotic recombination, or mutation. High levels of somatic mosaicism can lead to various health issues depending on the specific genetic changes involved.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are major instability and high levels of somatic mosaicism. These conditions can be indicative of various genetic disorders or diseases."},
