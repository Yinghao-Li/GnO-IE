Telomeric: Telomeres are not a disease per se, but they are structures at the ends of chromosomes that shorten as we age or when cells divide, leading to cellular aging and various age-related diseases.\n2. HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen): HLA is a complex of proteins on the surface of human cells that plays a crucial role in the immune system. It is not a disease, but certain variations in HLA genes have been linked to various diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph does not mention any specific diseases. It refers to a genetic region (5 Mb telomeric to HLA) that is associated with telomeres and the HLA complex."},
