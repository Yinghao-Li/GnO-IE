    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. A-T: Ataxia-Telangiectasia is a genetic disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias, and an increased risk of cancer. It is caused by mutations in the ATM gene, which encodes a protein involved in DNA repair.\n2. Patients: Individuals who have been diagnosed with a disease or medical condition, in this case, Ataxia-Telangiectasia.\n3. Obligate A-T heterozygotes: These are the parents of the Ataxia-Telangiectasia patients. They carry one normal and one mutated copy of the ATM gene, making them heterozygous carriers. They do not exhibit symptoms of the disease themselves but have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to their offspring.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) and the patients who have this condition."},
