CA: CA is an abbreviation for Carbonic Anhydrase, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction between carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid and hydroxide ions. It is a disease-causing entity when mutations in the CA gene lead to various forms of inherited metabolic disorders, such as primary hyperhidrosis, glaucoma, and cystic fibrosis.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the inherited metabolic disorders associated with mutations in the CA gene, such as primary hyperhidrosis, glaucoma, and cystic fibrosis."},
