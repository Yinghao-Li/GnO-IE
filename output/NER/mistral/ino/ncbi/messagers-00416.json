    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome: This is a specific disease or condition that is being discussed in the paragraph. It is characterized by craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skull bones) and limb anomalies. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\n2. Craniosynostosis: This is a medical condition where the skull bones fuse prematurely. It is a symptom of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome in this context.\n3. Autosomal dominant condition: This refers to a type of inheritance pattern where a mutated gene in one copy of the DNA in a chromosome is sufficient to cause the disease. In this context, it is describing Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.\n4. Mutations: This is a general term for a change in the DNA sequence that can lead to a disease or condition. In this context, the paragraph is discussing mutations in the TWIST, FGFR2, and FGFR3 genes.\n5. TWIST: This is a specific gene that is being mentioned as one of the genes that are being screened for mutations in the patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.\n6. FGFR2: This is another specific gene that is being mentioned as one of the genes that are being screened for mutations in the patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.\n7. FGFR3: This is yet another specific gene that is being mentioned as one of the genes that are being screened for mutations in the patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome\n2. Craniosynostosis\n3. Autosomal dominant condition (describing Saethre-Chotzen syndrome)\n4. Mutations (in the context of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome)\n5. TWIST gene mutation\n6. FGFR2 gene mutation\n7. FGFR3 gene mutation."},
