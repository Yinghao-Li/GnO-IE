    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. \"constitutive methylation\": This term refers to the stable, heritable epigenetic modification of DNA that occurs without an external trigger or environmental influence. It is not a disease per se, but rather a state of DNA methylation.\n2. \"CTG repeat\": CTG repeats are a type of repetitive DNA sequence, and expansions of these repeats can lead to various genetic disorders, such as Huntington's disease. However, in this context, the paragraph is not explicitly stating that there is a disease associated with the CTG repeat mentioned.\n3. \"patients\": The paragraph mentions \"most of the patients,\" but it does not specify what disease or condition these patients have in common. Therefore, it is not possible to identify a specific disease entity based on this information alone."},
