It is not a disease, but a diagnostic tool.\n2. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP): This is a method used to detect sequence variations in DNA by analyzing the electrophoretic mobility of denatured single-stranded DNA. It is not a disease, but a diagnostic technique.\n3. Proband: A proband is an individual who is the index case or the first person in a family to be identified as having a particular disease or condition.\n4. C6 gene mutations: These are genetic variations in the C6 gene that are associated with a disease or condition. The specific disease or condition is not mentioned in the paragraph, so it cannot be identified. However, the presence of mutations in the C6 gene suggests that the proband may have a genetic disorder related to that gene. Some possible conditions associated with C6 gene mutations include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome."},
