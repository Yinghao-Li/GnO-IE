DMPK gene: This is a specific gene that is associated with myotonic dystrophy. Mutations in this gene are known to cause the disease.\n3. Hypermethylated: This is a biochemical modification that can affect gene expression. In this context, it refers to an abnormal increase in the methylation of the DMPK gene in severely affected myotonic dystrophy patients.\n4. CTG repeat: This is a specific type of repeat sequence found in the DMPK gene. Expansion of this repeat sequence is a hallmark of myotonic dystrophy and is responsible for the disease phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are Myotonic dystrophy, DMPK gene, and the expanded CTG repeat."},
