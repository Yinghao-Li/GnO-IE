Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome: It is a form of craniosynostosis characterized by premature fusion of the coronal sutures, midline facial deformities, and limb abnormalities.\n3. Crouzon Syndrome: It is a form of craniosynostosis characterized by premature fusion of the coronal and sagittal sutures, midline facial deformities, and intellectual disability.\n4. Pfeiffer Syndrome: It is a form of craniosynostosis characterized by premature fusion of the coronal sutures, broad thumbs and big toes, and midline facial deformities.\n\nThe paragraph discusses the overlap of genes causing Saethre-Chotzen, Crouzon, and Pfeiffer syndromes, which are all forms of craniosynostosis. Therefore, craniosynostosis is the overarching disease entity, and Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome, Crouzon Syndrome, and Pfeiffer Syndrome are specific types or conditions under the disease entity of craniosynostosis."},
