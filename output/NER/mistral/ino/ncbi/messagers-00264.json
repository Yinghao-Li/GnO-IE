Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I: This is a complex of proteins on the cell surface that plays a crucial role in the immune system by presenting antigens to CD8+ T cells. It is not a disease itself, but a group of proteins that can be associated with various diseases.\n2. Mutation: A change in the DNA sequence that can result in a disease or a predisposition to a disease. In this context, the specific mutation mentioned is Cys-282- > Tyr (C282Y).\n3. Cys-282: A specific amino acid residue in a protein, cysteine (Cys), at position 282.\n4. Tyr: A specific amino acid residue, tyrosine (Tyr).\n\nSo, the disease-related entities in the paragraph are the mutation (Cys-282- > Tyr or C282Y) and the specific gene product with the mutation. The exact disease or condition caused by this mutation is not mentioned in the paragraph."},
