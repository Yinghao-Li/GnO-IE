The repeat length refers to the expansion of a specific DNA sequence in the gene associated with DM. Somatic mosaicism is the presence of two or more distinct cell populations in an individual, which can arise from a single fertilized egg and can result in varying degrees of disease expression. In this context, the paragraph is discussing the increase in repeat length and somatic mosaicism with age in the mouse model of DM."},
