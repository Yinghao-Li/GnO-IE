    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Constitutional RB1 - gene mutations: This refers to genetic mutations in the RB1 gene that are present in all cells of the body, including the cells that give rise to the retinoblastoma tumor in one eye. The mutation is \"constitutional\" because it is present from birth and not acquired later in life.\n2. Retinoblastoma: This is the specific disease or condition that is being studied in the paragraph. It is a type of eye cancer that affects the retina and is often present at birth or develops in early childhood. The disease is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene.\n3. Isolated unilateral retinoblastoma: This is a specific type of retinoblastoma where the tumor is present in only one eye and there are no tumors in the other eye or other parts of the body. The term \"isolated\" means that there are no other associated conditions or syndromes present.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Constitutional RB1 gene mutations\n2. Retinoblastoma\n3. Isolated unilateral retinoblastoma."},
