In this context, it indicates that the mice have two copies of the mutated Smad4 gene.\n2. Smad4: Smad4 is a protein, specifically a member of the Smad family of proteins, which plays a crucial role in the TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-β) signaling pathway. Mutations in Smad4 can lead to various diseases, including Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. In this context, the mutation in Smad4 is causing the disease or condition in the mice.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"Homozygous Smad4 mutation\" or \"Smad4 mutation.\""},
