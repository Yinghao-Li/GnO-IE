Missense mutation: A type of genetic mutation where a single nucleotide is changed, resulting in the substitution of one amino acid for another. It is not a disease, but a genetic alteration that can potentially cause a disease depending on the location and effect on the protein function.\n3. Exon 21: A segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein sequence. It is not a disease, but a part of the genome.\n4. Nucleotide position 28: A specific location in the DNA sequence. It is not a disease, but a part of the genomic structure.\n5. Cys: Cysteine is an amino acid. It is not a disease, but a building block of proteins.\n6. Arg: Arginine is an amino acid. It is not a disease, but a building block of proteins.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities in the given paragraph."},
