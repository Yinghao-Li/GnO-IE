They are not considered diseases in and of themselves, but mutations or variations in splice variants can lead to various diseases.\n2. Exon 32: An exon is a segment of DNA that codes for a protein. Skipping of exon 32 refers to the absence of this exon in the mature RNA transcript. Mutations or variations in exons can lead to diseases depending on the function of the protein they encode.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph mentions the involvement of \"splice variants\" and \"exon 32,\" but it does not explicitly state that a specific disease is being discussed."},
