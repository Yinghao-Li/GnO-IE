However, since the context of the paragraph is about diseases, it's important to note that mutations in the BRCA1 gene can lead to various diseases, most notably, breast cancer. So, we can consider \"breast cancer associated with BRCA1 gene mutations\" as the disease entity in this context.\n\n2. High-grade, non-inherited breast carcinomas: This refers to a specific type of breast cancer. \"Breast carcinoma\" is a type of cancer that originates in the breast tissue. \"High-grade\" refers to the aggressiveness and malignancy of the cancer cells. \"Non-inherited\" means that the cancer is not caused by an inherited gene mutation. So, the disease entity here is \"high-grade, non-inherited breast cancer.\""},
