Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP): a genetic disorder that causes numerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon and rectum, leading to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.\n   b. Gardner's Syndrome: a subtype of FAP, characterized by the development of benign and malignant tumors in various organs, including the colon, rectum, and bones.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the term \"APC mutations\" refers to genetic alterations in the APC gene. The context does not provide enough information to determine the specific disease(s) affecting the seven kindreds. However, since APC mutations are known to cause FAP and Gardner's Syndrome, it is possible that some or all of these conditions are present in the described kindreds."},
