It is a type of obesity and not a specific disease, but it can be a symptom or complication of various underlying conditions.\n2. Adrenal insufficiency: Also known as Addison's disease, it is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, leading to various symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and low blood pressure.\n3. Red hair pigmentation: This is a condition where an individual has red hair due to a genetic mutation that affects the production of the pigment melanin. It is not a disease but a trait.\n4. POMC gene defect: A genetic defect within the POMC gene is the underlying cause of the described condition. POMC gene mutations can lead to various endocrine disorders, including early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair pigmentation."},
