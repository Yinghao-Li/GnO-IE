It does not directly refer to a specific disease entity.\n2. Immunochemical studies: Immunochemistry is a branch of chemistry that deals with the chemical reactions of antibodies and antigens. It is used in the diagnosis and study of various diseases, particularly those related to the immune system. Therefore, the term \"immunochemical studies\" could be considered a broad category that includes various diseases that are diagnosed or studied using immunochemical methods. Some examples of diseases that may be diagnosed or studied using immunochemical methods include autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are not explicitly mentioned, but they could include various diseases that are diagnosed or studied using clinical and immunochemical methods."},
