T - PLL: This is likely a type of Polymorphism (a genetic variation in the population) or a specific disease or condition related to T-cells and PLL (Poly-Lymphocytic Leukemia).

Mutated: This term suggests a genetic alteration or change, which could be associated with various diseases.\n\n3. A - T allele: This is a specific genetic variant or allele, which could be associated with various diseases depending on the context. In this case, it's mentioned that it's a previously reported allele, but no further information is provided about the specific disease or condition associated with it.\n\nSo, based on the given paragraph, the following entities can be identified as potentially related to diseases:\n\n1.

A - T allele\n\nHowever, without more context, it's impossible to definitively label these entities as diseases themselves, as they could be associated with various diseases or conditions."},
