Sporadic T - cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T - PLL): This is a type of clonal malignancy, which means it is a type of cancer that arises from an abnormal clone of cells. T - PLL is a rare form of mature T-cell leukaemia.\n2. A - T: This is likely a reference to Ataxia-Telangiectasia, a genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to various cancers, including T-cell leukaemias.\n3. ATM mutations: This refers to mutations in the ATM (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated) gene. ATM is a tumour suppressor gene, and mutations in this gene have been linked to an increased risk of developing various types of cancer, including T-cell leukaemias."},
