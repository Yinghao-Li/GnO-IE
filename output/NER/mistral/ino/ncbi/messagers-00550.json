It is used to identify specific genetic sequences or chromosomal locations in cells.\n2. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS): This is a genetic disorder characterized by a variety of developmental symptoms, including weak muscle tone (hypotonia), short stature, and a constant feeling of hunger. It is caused by the deletion or malfunctioning of certain genes on chromosome 15.\n3. Derivative chromosome 3: This refers to a chromosome that has undergone a structural change, such as a translocation or inversion, resulting in a non-standard appearance. It is not a disease, but rather a chromosomal abnormality.\n4. Normal pair of 15s: This refers to the normal, or non-affected, pair of chromosome 15 in the individual being tested. It is not a disease.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS)."},
