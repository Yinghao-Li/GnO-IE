Disease concordant: This term refers to twins who have the same disease or condition.\n3. B27-positive dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs: These are fraternal twins who develop from two separate fertilized eggs and share only about half of their genes. The \"B27\" likely refers to a specific genetic marker or factor associated with a particular disease or condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are the conditions or diseases that the twins may have, but the paragraph does not specify what those diseases are."},
