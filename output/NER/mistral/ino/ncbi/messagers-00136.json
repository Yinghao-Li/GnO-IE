It could be caused by various factors, including diseases.\n2. Adult onset DM: This likely refers to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, which is a metabolic disease characterized by high blood sugar levels. It typically develops in adults.\n3. Congenital DM: This refers to a type of diabetes that is present at birth. It can be caused by various genetic mutations.\n4. Paternal transmission: This refers to the passing of genetic traits from father to offspring.\n5. Repetition: This term is not a disease, but it is mentioned in relation to the contraction of a repeat upon male transmission. It likely refers to a specific genetic sequence that is repeated in the DNA.\n\nTherefore, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are decreased fertility, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and congenital diabetes."},
