In this context, it is not explicitly stated what disease is being referred to in the sporadic cases, so no specific disease entity can be identified.\n2. Familial cases: These are cases of a disease that are inherited from parents. Again, no specific disease entity is mentioned, so no specific disease entity can be identified based on this information alone.\n3. Mutations: Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of an organism. They can be associated with various diseases, but the specific disease is not mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, \"mutations\" is not a specific disease entity, but rather a genetic phenomenon that can be linked to various diseases."},

The paragraph only mentions \"cases\" and \"mutations,\" but it does not specify which disease or diseases are being referred to.
