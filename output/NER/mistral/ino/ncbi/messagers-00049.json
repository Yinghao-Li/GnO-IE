    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Membranous glomerulonephritis: This is a type of glomerulonephritis, which is a disease characterized by inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys, leading to damage of the filtration membrane.\n2. Vasculitis: This is a group of diseases characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels.\n3. Arthritis: This is a general term for inflammation of the joints.\n4. Lack of C5 and its biologic functions: C5 is a component of the complement system, which plays a crucial role in the immune response against infections. The lack of C5 and its functions can lead to various diseases, including increased susceptibility to infections.\n5. Remarkable propensity to bacterial infections: This is a condition where an individual has a higher than normal likelihood of developing bacterial infections."},
