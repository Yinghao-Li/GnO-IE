    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Mutations: Mutations are not considered a disease per se, but they can lead to various diseases depending on the specific location and type of mutation in the genome.\n2. Loss of function of the mutant allele: This is a potential outcome of a mutation, and it can lead to various diseases depending on the function of the gene in question. For example, if the gene encodes a protein that is essential for life or has an important function, a loss-of-function mutation can result in a disease.\n3. Exonic substitutions: Exonic substitutions refer to changes in the DNA sequence that occur within the coding regions of a gene. Some exonic substitutions can lead to diseases by altering the structure or function of the resulting protein.\n4. Nonsense codons: Nonsense codons are codons that do not code for any amino acid. When a mutation results in the creation of a nonsense codon, the translation process is terminated prematurely, leading to the production of a truncated and often non-functional protein. This can result in various diseases depending on the function of the affected gene."},
