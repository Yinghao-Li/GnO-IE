It is a type of diabetes characterized by excessive urination and thirst due to the deficiency or dysfunction of vasopressin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland.\n2. Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) - This is a specific type of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus that is inherited.\n3. Vasopressin - This is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that plays a role in regulating water balance in the body. A mutation in the vasopressin gene can cause NDI.\n4. Missense substitution - This is a type of genetic mutation where a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence is replaced by another nucleotide, resulting in a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein.\n5. Nonsense mutation - This is a type of genetic mutation where a single nucleotide is changed to a stop codon, causing the production of a truncated or nonfunctional protein."},
