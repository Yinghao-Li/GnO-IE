    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Somatic mutation rates: This refers to the acquisition of mutations in the somatic cells of an organism, which are non-germline cells. Somatic mutations do not get passed on to the next generation. This is not a disease per se, but mutations can lead to various diseases depending on their location and nature.\n2. Transcriptional levels of the three genes (DMAHP, DMPK, and 59): Transcription is the process of producing RNA copies of genes. Alterations in transcriptional levels can be a result of various diseases or genetic conditions, such as mutations, epigenetic modifications, or chromosomal abnormalities. However, in this context, the paragraph is stating that there is no correlation between the somatic mutation rates and the transcriptional levels of these three specific genes, so it's not explicitly mentioning any diseases associated with these genes."},
