It is not identified as a disease per se, but a mutation that could potentially cause a disease depending on the context.\n2. A novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8: This is another genetic mutation, a specific change in the DNA sequence. Again, it is not identified as a disease, but a mutation that could potentially lead to a disease depending on the context.\n3. Substitution of alanine 464 by valine (A464V): This is a specific amino acid substitution resulting from the paternal mutation. Depending on the context, this substitution could lead to a disease or a benign condition.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph mentions two genetic mutations (459 + 1G > A and the cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8) that could potentially lead to diseases, but it does not explicitly identify any diseases in the text."},
