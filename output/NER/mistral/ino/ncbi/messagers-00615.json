    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Aniridia: It is a condition characterized by the partial or complete absence of the iris in the eye. Aniridia is one of the phenotypes caused by heterozygous mutations in the human PAX6 gene.\n\n2. Peters anomaly: It is a congenital condition characterized by a central corneal opacity and a defect in the iris and/or the zonules. Peters anomaly is also a phenotype caused by heterozygous mutations in the human PAX6 gene.\n\n3. Autosomal dominant keratitis: It is a type of keratitis, which is an inflammation of the cornea. Autosomal dominant keratitis is a phenotype caused by heterozygous mutations in the human PAX6 gene.\n\n4. Familial foveal dysplasia: It is a condition characterized by abnormal development or malfunctioning of the fovea, which is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. Familial foveal dysplasia is a phenotype caused by heterozygous mutations in the human PAX6 gene.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Aniridia, Peters anomaly, Autosomal dominant keratitis, and Familial foveal dysplasia."},
