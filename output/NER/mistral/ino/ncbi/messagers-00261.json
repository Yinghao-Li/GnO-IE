Sp1 consensus binding site: This is not a disease per se, but rather a specific sequence of DNA that acts as a binding site for the transcription factor Sp1.\n2.

In some cases, expansions of CTG repeats can lead to genetic disorders, such as Huntington's disease or myotonic dystrophy.\n3. Hypermethylated DMPK gene: DMPK is a specific gene, and hypermethylation of this gene is a condition or state that can be associated with certain diseases, such as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy or some types of cancer."},
