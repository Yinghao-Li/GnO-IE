Melanoma: Melanoma is a type of disease, specifically a type of cancer that affects the pigment-producing cells in the skin called melanocytes.\n2. p16: p16 is a tumor suppressor protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle. Mutations in the p16 gene can contribute to the development of various types of cancer, including melanoma.\n3. CDK4: CDK4 is a cyclin-dependent kinase that plays a role in the cell cycle. Mutations in the CDK4 gene have been linked to the development of melanoma and other types of cancer.\n4. Germline mutations: Germline mutations refer to genetic mutations that are present in the DNA of an individual's germ cells (sperm and eggs), which can be passed down from parent to offspring.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are:\n\n1. Melanoma\n2. p16-related mutations\n3. CDK4-related mutations\n4. Germline mutations."},
