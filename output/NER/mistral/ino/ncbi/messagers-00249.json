ATM mutations: ATM is a gene that provides instructions for making a protein called Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), which is involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control. Mutations in this gene can lead to various health conditions, including a group of disorders known as Ataxia-Telangiectasia and other related syndromes. These disorders are characterized by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, and an increased risk of cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
