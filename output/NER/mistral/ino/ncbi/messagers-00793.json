    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Single-nucleotide events: This term refers to mutations that involve the alteration of a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence. It is a type of genetic variation that can lead to various genetic disorders.\n2. Deletions: This term refers to the loss of a segment of DNA, which can result in the deletion of one or more genes or parts of genes. Deletions can cause various genetic disorders, depending on the specific genes involved.\n3. Substitutions: This term refers to the replacement of one nucleotide with another in the DNA sequence. Substitutions can lead to various genetic disorders, depending on the specific nucleotides involved and their location in the DNA sequence.\n4. Splice sites: Splice sites are specific sequences of DNA that mark the boundaries of introns and exons in pre-mRNA. Mutations in splice sites can lead to incorrect splicing of RNA transcripts, resulting in various genetic disorders.\n5. Codons: Codons are sequences of three nucleotides in DNA or RNA that code for specific amino acids. Mutations in codons can lead to the production of abnormal or nonfunctional proteins, resulting in various genetic disorders."},
