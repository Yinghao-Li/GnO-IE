Look up medical databases or literature to confirm if these mutations are associated with any known diseases.\n3. Based on current knowledge, there is no definitive evidence that G301C and S162F mutations are directly linked to a specific disease. These mutations are often found in various genes and can contribute to different conditions depending on the specific gene involved. For example, the G301C mutation in the BRCA1 gene is associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The S162F mutation in the CFTR gene is linked to cystic fibrosis. It is essential to consider the context in which these mutations are mentioned to determine the specific disease association.\n\nTherefore, without further context, it is not possible to definitively identify any diseases in the given paragraph."},
