It can be considered a part of the acute-phase response and is often used as a marker of inflammation and liver disease.\n2. Hp2 and Hp1 are different phenotypes of the Haptoglobin gene. Hp2 is the normal, wild-type allele, while Hp1 is a variant allele associated with a lower production of Haptoglobin.\n3. Hpdel is a variant allele that results in the absence of Haptoglobin production.\n\nEntities:\n1. Haptoglobin (Hp)\n2. Hp2\n3. Hp1\n4. Hpdel (Haptoglobin Delhi)\n\nThe individuals in the paragraph are classified as Hp2/Hpdel and Hp1/Hpdel, indicating their genotypes for the Haptoglobin gene. The Hp2/Hpdel individuals have extremely low levels of Haptoglobin, while the Hp1/Hpdel individual has no detectable Haptoglobin."},
