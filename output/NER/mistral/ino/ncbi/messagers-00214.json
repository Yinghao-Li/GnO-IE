Generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa: This is a specific type of epidermolysis bullosa, which is a group of genetic disorders that cause fragility of the skin and mucous membranes. The \"benign\" modifier indicates that the condition is not life-threatening, but it can still cause significant morbidity.\n2. Novel splice-site mutation: This refers to a genetic mutation that occurs at a site where the RNA transcript is spliced together during the process of making a protein. The \"novel\" modifier indicates that this mutation has not been described before.\n3. COL17A1: This is a specific gene that is mutated in the patient. COL17A1 encodes for a protein called collagen type XVII, which is important for the anchoring of epidermal cells to the basement membrane. Mutations in this gene can cause various forms of epidermolysis bullosa.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa\n2. Novel splice-site mutation in COL17A1 gene."},
