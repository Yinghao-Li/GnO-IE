Germline mutations: Germline mutations refer to genetic variations present in the DNA of an individual's germ cells (sperm and eggs), which can be passed down to their offspring.\n3. p16 gene: The p16 gene is a tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in this gene have been linked to various types of cancer, including melanoma.\n4. CDK4 gene: The CDK4 gene is also a tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in this gene have been associated with an increased risk of melanoma."},
