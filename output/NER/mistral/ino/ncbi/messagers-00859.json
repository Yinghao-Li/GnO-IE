    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Heterozygous germ-line mutations: This refers to a genetic mutation that is present in the germ cells (sperm or eggs) of an individual, meaning that the mutation is passed down from parent to offspring. It is present in only one of the two copies of the gene in each cell.\n2. DNA mismatch repair genes: These are genes that play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the genome by repairing errors that occur during DNA replication. Mutations in these genes can lead to a condition known as Mismatch Repair Deficiency.\n3. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC): This is a type of colorectal cancer that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that a mutation in just one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disease. It is also known as Lynch Syndrome. The condition is characterized by an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, as well as an increased risk of developing other types of cancers, such as endometrial, ovarian, and gastric cancers."},
