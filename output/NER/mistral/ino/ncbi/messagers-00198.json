However, it's important to note that certain diseases may be more prevalent in specific populations, so it's worth keeping this context in mind.\n\n2. Utah Mormon patients: Similar to Japanese patients, this term refers to a population or demographic group. Again, certain diseases may be more common in specific populations, so it's important to consider this context.\n\n3. African American patients: Like Japanese and Utah Mormon patients, this term refers to a population or demographic group. There are various diseases that disproportionately affect African Americans, so it's important to keep this context in mind.\n\n4. Mutations: Mutations are not diseases themselves, but they can cause or contribute to various diseases. In this context, the paragraph is discussing the observation of mutations in different patient populations, so it's important to keep in mind that the mutations could potentially lead to the development of diseases.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph mentions the following disease-related entities:\n\n1. Various diseases that may be more prevalent in Japanese, Utah Mormon, and African American populations due to the observed mutations.\n2. Mutations that could potentially lead to the development of diseases."},
