It is not a specific disease, but rather a symptom or condition that can be caused by various underlying diseases or conditions.\n2. Altered Dp71 transcripts: This refers to mutations or changes in the Dp71 gene that result in the production of abnormal Dp71 proteins. Dp71 is a protein involved in neuronal development and function. The altered transcripts could potentially cause disease, but the specific disease is not mentioned.\n3. Deleted Dp140 DNA sequences: This refers to the absence or deletion of a specific sequence of DNA that codes for the Dp140 protein. The consequences of this deletion on health and disease are not clear without additional context.\n\nTherefore, the specific diseases caused by the altered Dp71 transcripts and deleted Dp140 DNA sequences are not mentioned in the paragraph. Further information would be needed to identify the specific diseases or conditions associated with these genetic alterations."},
