    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Maternal disomy 15: This is a condition where a person has two copies of chromosome 15 from the same parent instead of one copy from each parent. It is a type of uniparental disomy.\n2. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS): Prader-Willi Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by obesity, short stature, and cognitive impairment. It is caused by the deletion or mutation of certain genes on chromosome 15.\n3. t(3;15)(p25;q11.2): This is a specific chromosomal translocation, where a segment of chromosome 3 has been transferred to chromosome 15 at bands p25 and q11.2, respectively.\n4. Meiotic nondisjunction: This is a process that results in the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate during meiosis, leading to gametes with an abnormal number of chromosomes. In this case, it refers to the nondisjunction of chromosome 15."},
