Prader-Willi Syndrome: Prader-Willi syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by hypotonia, developmental delays, short stature, and insatiable appetite leading to obesity. It is caused by deletions or mutations in the paternal copy of the 15q11-q13 region. The imprinting center mutations you mentioned in the paragraph likely refer to mutations in this region that disrupt the normal imprinting of certain genes, leading to the symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome."},
