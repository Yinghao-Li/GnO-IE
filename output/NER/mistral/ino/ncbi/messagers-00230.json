They do not cause diseases on their own but can influence the expression or function of a gene, potentially leading to diseases when in combination with other factors.\n\nTherefore, in this context, the term \"intragenic polymorphisms\" is not directly referring to any specific diseases. Instead, it is a term used to describe genetic variations within genes."},
