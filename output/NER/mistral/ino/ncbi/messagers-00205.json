VHL gene: This is a gene that is mutated or non-functional in Von Hippel-Lindau disease, a genetic condition that increases the risk of developing various types of cancer, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\n2. VHL-negative RCC cancer cells: These are renal cell carcinoma cells that do not have a functional VHL gene.\n3. Cell cycle: This is a series of events that takes place in a cell leading to its division and the formation of two daughter cells. Dysregulation of the cell cycle can lead to various diseases, including cancer.\n4. G0 / quiescence: This is a state of cellular rest or dormancy, where the cell is not actively dividing. It is often seen in cells that are not in need of growth or division, such as cells in the adult body or during development. Dysregulation of the cell cycle can prevent cells from entering this state, leading to uncontrolled growth and cancer."},
