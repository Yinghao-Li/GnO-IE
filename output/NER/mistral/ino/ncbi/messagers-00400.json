It is a genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper in various tissues due to a defect in the ATP7B gene.\n2. Mutation: This is not a disease per se, but a change in the DNA sequence that can lead to the development of a disease. In this context, the mutation referred to is a specific insertion of a C nucleotide at position 2302 in the ATP7B gene, which is associated with Wilson disease."},
