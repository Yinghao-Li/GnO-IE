HLA haplotypes: Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) are proteins on the surface of cells that play a role in the immune system. Haplotypes are specific combinations of alleles (variants) of these genes. They are not diseases, but certain HLA types or haplotypes can be associated with increased risk for certain diseases.\n4. Caucasians: This refers to a racial or ethnic group, not a disease.\n5. recent admixture: Admixture refers to the interbreeding between different population groups. It is not a disease, but it can lead to the introduction of new genetic variants into a population."},
