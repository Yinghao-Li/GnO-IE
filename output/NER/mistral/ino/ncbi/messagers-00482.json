It is not a disease itself, but a genetic variant that can lead to a disease.\n2. Early processing of the alpha - subunit of beta - hexosaminididase A: This is a biochemical process that may be affected by the W474C mutation. It is not a disease, but a potential cause of a disease.\n3. Subacute G (M2) gangliosidosis: This is a specific type of lysosomal storage disorder, which is a disease. It is characterized by the accumulation of certain glycosphingolipids in the nervous system due to a deficiency of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A. The M2 subtype refers to a specific genetic mutation that causes this condition."},
