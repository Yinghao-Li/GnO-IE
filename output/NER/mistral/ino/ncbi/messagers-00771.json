    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Homozygous deficiency: This refers to a condition where an individual inherits two copies of a gene with a mutation or absence of a functional gene from each parent. In this context, it implies that the patient lacks functional copies of the FH gene.\n2. FH gene: FH stands for Factor H, a gene that provides instructions for making a protein involved in the regulation of the complement system, which plays a crucial role in the immune response against infections. A deficiency or mutation in this gene can lead to various diseases, including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).\n\nSo, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are:\n\n1. Homozygous deficiency of the FH gene\n2. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) (implied, as FH gene deficiency can cause aHUS)\n3. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) (implied, as FH gene deficiency can cause MPGN)"},
