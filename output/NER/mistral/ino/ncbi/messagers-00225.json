Junctional epidermolysis bullosa: This is a broader category of diseases that includes the specific form mentioned above (generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa).\n3. Blistering: This is a symptom or manifestation of the disease, specifically a generalized symptom affecting patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa.\n4. Nail dystrophy: This is another symptom or manifestation of the disease, specifically affecting the nails of patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa.\n5. Patchy alopecia: This is yet another symptom or manifestation of the disease, specifically affecting the hair of patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa.\n6.
