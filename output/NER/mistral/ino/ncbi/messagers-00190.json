ATM mutations\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"cancers\" in general, with a focus on \"familial and sporadic cancers.\" \"Familial cancers\" refer to cancers that have a genetic component, meaning they are passed down through families. \"Sporadic cancers,\" on the other hand, are those that occur randomly, without a known family history.\n\nThe paragraph also mentions \"ATM mutations.\" ATM stands for Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated, which is a gene that, when mutated, can lead to a disorder called Ataxia-Telangiectasia. However, in this context, the focus is on the role of ATM mutations in cancer risk and development. Therefore, the mutations are considered a disease entity, specifically a genetic mutation that may contribute to cancer."},
