ATM is a gene that provides instructions for making a protein involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control. Mutations in this gene can lead to Ataxia-Telangiectasia, a rare, progressive, and degenerative disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias, and increased susceptibility to cancer and infections."},
