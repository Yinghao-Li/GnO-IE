It refers to small deletions in the DNA sequence.\n2. 4649delA: This is a specific genetic mutation or deletion. It refers to the deletion of a single adenine (A) nucleotide at position 4649 in a specific gene.\n3. 7883del5: This is another specific genetic mutation or deletion. It refers to the deletion of five nucleotides at position 7883 in a specific gene.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are the specific genetic mutations or deletions mentioned, which are 4649delA and 7883del5. These mutations could potentially be associated with various genetic disorders depending on the specific gene in which they occur."},
