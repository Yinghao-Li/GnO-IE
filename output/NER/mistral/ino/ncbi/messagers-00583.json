However, the use of oral contraceptives can be associated with certain health conditions or side effects, such as thromboembolism, breast cancer, or mood disorders. Therefore, it's important to consider the context in which the term is used in the paragraph. In this case, it seems to be mentioned as an exposure or risk factor, so it's not explicitly identified as a disease entity. However, the potential health conditions associated with oral contraceptive use could be considered as related conditions or complications."},
