    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Classical late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD): This is a specific type and a disease name. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a lysosomal storage disorder, and the classical late infantile form is characterized by the onset of symptoms between 2 and 4 years of age and a survival rate of around 5-10 years.\n\n2. Arylsulfatase A (ARSA) deficiency: This is a specific enzyme deficiency that causes MLD. Arylsulfatase A is an enzyme responsible for breaking down certain sulfated lipids, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of sulfated lipids, such as galactosylsulfatide, in the body.\n\n3. Increased galactosylsulfatide (GS) excretion: This is a symptom or a biomarker of MLD. Galactosylsulfatide is a sulfated lipid that accumulates in the body due to the deficiency of arylsulfatase A, and its increased excretion is a diagnostic marker for MLD."},
