Informative carrier: This term refers to a carrier of a genetic mutation who passes on the mutation to their offspring and also carries identifiable signs or symptoms of the disease. In this context, it's likely that the disease in question is a genetic disorder that follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\n2. Affected child: This term refers to an individual who has developed the disease or condition in question.\n3. Premutation carrier: This term refers to an individual who carries a genetic mutation that is not large enough to cause symptoms but can expand and lead to the development of the disease in their offspring. In the context of this paragraph, it appears that the premutation carrier is an exception to the rule that the expansion size decreases in informative carrier transmissions.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are likely a genetic disorder that follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and the specific mutation in question is a trinucleotide repeat expansion."},
