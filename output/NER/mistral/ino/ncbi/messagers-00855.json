ARSA (Arylsulfatase A): It is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of certain sugars called glycosaminoglycans. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to MLD.\n3. GS levels: GS likely refers to the levels of glycosaminoglycans, which are substrates for ARSA enzyme.\n4. A464V: It is a specific mutation or variant of the ARSA gene.\n5. ARSA pseudodeficiency allele: It is a genetic variant of the ARSA gene that mimics the effect of a deficiency but does not actually cause a clinical manifestation of the disease.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to diseases in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (MLD)\n2. ARSA deficiency\n3. ARSA pseudodeficiency."},
