FAP (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis): This is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous polyps (adenomatous polyps) in the colon and rectum. The paragraph mentions \"FAP colorectal cancer,\" which indicates that the study is related to this condition.\n\n2. APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) gene: This is a specific gene that is mutated in FAP, leading to the development of the disease. The paragraph states that \"direct mutation analysis of the APC gene\" was performed in the study.\n\n3. Extracolonic manifestations: These are health problems that occur outside of the colon and rectum in individuals with FAP. The paragraph mentions \"nine extracolonic manifestations\" that were studied in the research.\n\n4. Non-FAP colorectal cancer: This refers to colorectal cancer that occurs in individuals who do not have FAP. The study investigated the incidence of APC mutations in this group as well."},
