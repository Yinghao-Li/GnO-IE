    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Multiple colorectal adenomas: This is a condition characterized by the growth of multiple adenomas in the colon or rectum. Adenomas are benign growths that can develop into colon cancer if left untreated.\n2. Carcinoma: This is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that line organs or tissues. In this context, it likely refers to colorectal carcinoma, which is cancer that develops in the colon or rectum.\n3. FAP (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis): This is a genetic disorder that causes the development of numerous adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum. It is a form of inherited colorectal cancer.\n4. APC gene: This is a tumor suppressor gene that produces a protein called adenomatous polyposis coli. Mutations in this gene can lead to the development of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are: multiple colorectal adenomas, carcinoma (colorectal carcinoma), FAP (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis), and mutations in the APC gene."},
