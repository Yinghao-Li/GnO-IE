UBE3A: This is a specific gene name, and UBE3A gene mutations or dysfunctions have been linked to certain diseases, such as Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Therefore, UBE3A can be considered a disease entity in a broader context, as mutations in this gene can cause various disorders. However, in the given paragraph, it is mentioned as a cDNA (complementary DNA), which is a copy of a gene's DNA sequence obtained from RNA. In this context, UBE3A is not a disease but a gene.\n\n2. cDNA analysis: This is a laboratory technique used to study genes and their mutations. It is not considered a disease but a method used to identify and analyze diseases.\n\nTherefore, no specific disease entities are mentioned in the paragraph."},
