Haptoglobin is a protein that plays a role in the transport and removal of free hemoglobin in the blood. Low levels of haptoglobin can indicate the presence of hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells) or other conditions that cause the release of free hemoglobin into the bloodstream. The exact cause of hypohaptoglobinemia is not well understood, making it the disease entity in this paragraph."},
