It can be considered a disease or disorder entity if there is a known condition associated with abnormal levels or function of BARD1. However, without further context, it is unclear if BARD1 is a disease entity in this paragraph.\n\n2. BRCA1: It is a protein named \"BRCA1\" that is being compared to BARD1 in terms of steady-state levels during cell cycle progression. Like BARD1, its status as a disease or disorder entity depends on whether there is a known condition associated with abnormal levels or function of BRCA1. In many cases, mutations in the BRCA1 gene are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Therefore, BRCA1 can be considered a disease entity in this context."},
