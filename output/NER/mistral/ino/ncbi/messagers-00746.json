Dp71 and Dp140: These are brain isoforms of dystrophin, a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of muscle fibers. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the lack of functional dystrophin leads to muscle degeneration. However, the specific roles of Dp71 and Dp140 in cognitive impairment are not clearly understood and are the focus of the question.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to diseases in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
