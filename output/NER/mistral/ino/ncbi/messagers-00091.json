Dominantly inherited neurodegeneration: This is a type of neurodegenerative disease that is inherited in a dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disease.\n2. Neurodegeneration: This is a general term for the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons in the brain or other parts of the nervous system.\n3. Magnocellular neuron: This is a type of neuron that is characterized by their large size and are located in various parts of the brain, including the basal ganglia and the hypothalamus. Some diseases that affect magnocellular neurons include Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation type 1 (NBIA1) and certain forms of Parkinson's disease."},
