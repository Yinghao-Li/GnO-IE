Non-familial cancers\n\nThe first entity identified is the BRCA1 tumour suppressor gene. A tumour suppressor gene is a type of gene that helps prevent or suppress the development of cancer. In this context, the term \"BRCA1\" refers to a specific tumour suppressor gene.\n\nThe second entity identified is hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer refers to a type of cancer that is passed down through families due to mutations in specific genes, such as the BRCA1 gene.\n\nThe third entity identified is non-familial cancers. Non-familial cancers refer to cancers that are not inherited from one's family history. These cancers are typically caused by environmental or lifestyle factors, or random mutations. In the context of the paragraph, the role of the BRCA1 gene in non-familial cancers is unclear."},
