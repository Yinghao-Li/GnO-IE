When mutated, it can lead to various health conditions. In this context, it is identified as a gene. However, it is often associated with certain diseases, specifically Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD), when mutated. Therefore, it can also be considered a disease entity when referring to the conditions caused by its mutations.\n\n2. MLD: Metachromatic Leukodystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and other organs. It is caused by mutations in the ARSA gene, leading to the deficiency of acid ceramidase. This condition results in the accumulation of certain substances in the body, which can damage the nervous system and other tissues.\n\nTherefore, both ARSA gene mutations and Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) can be considered disease entities in the given paragraph."},
