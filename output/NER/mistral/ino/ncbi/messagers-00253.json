ATM is a gene that provides instructions for making a protein involved in the detection and response to DNA damage. Mutations in this gene can lead to various diseases, including Ataxia-Telangiectasia, a rare, progressive disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias, and increased susceptibility to infections and cancers.\n\nTherefore, \"ATM mutations\" is the disease entity in the paragraph. However, it's important to note that the paragraph does not specify which particular disease is being discussed, as ATM mutations can lead to several conditions."},
