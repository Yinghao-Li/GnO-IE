Hemostasis: It is a physiological process that prevents excessive blood loss from injuries by promoting the formation of a temporary seal to prevent blood from leaking out of vessels. It is the body's mechanism to stop bleeding.\n2. Defects in hemostasis: This refers to an impairment or dysfunction of the hemostatic process, leading to prolonged bleeding time and spontaneous bleeding events.\n3. Prolonged bleeding time: This is a condition where it takes an abnormally long time for a wound to stop bleeding.\n4. Spontaneous bleeding events: This refers to bleeding that occurs without an injury or trauma.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"defects in hemostasis,\" \"prolonged bleeding time,\" and \"spontaneous bleeding events.\""},
