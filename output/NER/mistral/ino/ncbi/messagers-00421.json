    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. TWIST mutations: This is a genetic condition or a specific disease caused by mutations in the TWIST gene.\n2. Coronal synostosis: This is a type of craniosynostosis, a condition where the bones in the skull fuse prematurely, specifically the coronal sutures.\n3. Brachycephaly: This is a condition where the skull is abnormally short from front to back, resulting in a round or shortened head shape.\n4. Low frontal hairline: This is a condition where the hairline is situated lower than normal on the forehead.\n5. Facial asymmetry: This is a condition where one side of the face is not the same as the other side.\n6. Ptosis: This is a condition where the eyelid droops or does not rise as high as it should.\n7. Hypertelorism: This is a condition where the eyes are excessively far apart.\n8. Broad great toes: This is a condition where the great toes are wider than normal.\n9. Clinodactyly: This is a condition where one or more fingers or toes are curved sideways.\n\nSo, the entities in the paragraph that can be identified as diseases or conditions are: TWIST mutations, coronal synostosis, brachycephaly, low frontal hairline, facial asymmetry, ptosis, hypertelorism, broad great toes, and clinodactyly."},
