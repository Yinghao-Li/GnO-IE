Hereditary hemochromatosis is a type of disease caused by mutations in the HFE gene.\n2. MHC: This stands for Major Histocompatibility Complex. It is a large genetic region that contains genes responsible for creating proteins involved in the immune system's response to foreign substances. MHC itself is not a disease, but it is mentioned in relation to HFE, which is a disease entity.\n3. Iron overload disease: This is a type of disease. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a specific type of iron overload disease.\n4. Hereditary hemochromatosis: This is a specific type of disease. It is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, leading to excessive absorption of iron in the body, resulting in iron overload."},
