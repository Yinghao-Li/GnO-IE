FAP: Familial Adenomatous Polyposis is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The term \"FAP patients\" in the paragraph refers to individuals diagnosed with this condition.\n\n2. Mutation subgroups: These are distinct groups of individuals within the FAP population who carry specific genetic mutations. The paragraph suggests that there are three such subgroups, and that differences in the nature of extracolonic manifestations (symptoms or conditions that appear outside the colon) have been identified between them.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and the three mutation subgroups of FAP."},
