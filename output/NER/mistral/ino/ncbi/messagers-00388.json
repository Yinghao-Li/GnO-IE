It is a disorder of iron metabolism that leads to excessive absorption of dietary iron by the body.\n\n2. (Implicit) In the context of the paragraph, the protein HFE is associated with hemochromatosis. Therefore, HFE is also a disease entity, specifically a gene or protein related to hemochromatosis.\n\n3.

It is not a disease itself, but it is mentioned in relation to the interaction with the HFE protein, which is a disease entity."},
