While it mentions that mutations are rare in sporadic cancers, it also suggests that loss of BRCA1 function through reduced expression or incorrect subcellular localization is important in non-familial breast and ovarian cancers. Therefore, both breast cancers and ovarian cancers are considered diseases in this context."},
