    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. TWIST mutations: This refers to mutations in the TWIST gene. TWIST is a gene that encodes for a transcription factor called Twist, which is involved in embryonic development and can contribute to various diseases, including skeletal and craniofacial disorders. Therefore, \"TWIST mutations\" can be considered a type of genetic disease or disorder caused by mutations in the TWIST gene.\n2. FGFR mutations: FGFR stands for Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor. FGFR mutations refer to alterations in the FGFR genes, which encode for receptors involved in cell growth, development, and differentiation. Mutations in these genes can lead to various diseases, including skeletal dysplasias, cancer, and craniofacial anomalies. Therefore, \"FGFR mutations\" can also be considered a type of genetic disease or disorder caused by mutations in the FGFR genes."},
