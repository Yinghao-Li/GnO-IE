BRCA1 is an established tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in this gene are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers.\n2. S phase: This is a phase of the cell cycle where DNA synthesis occurs. It is one of the three main phases of interphase, which is the part of the cell cycle where the cell grows and prepares to divide.\n3. G1 phase: This is the first phase of interphase, which is the part of the cell cycle where the cell grows in size and prepares to enter the mitotic phase (S, G2, and M phases).\n\nTherefore, the entities related to diseases in this paragraph are:\n\n1.
