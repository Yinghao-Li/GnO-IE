Acceptor splice - site mutation: This is a type of genetic mutation that affects the acceptor splice site, which is a specific sequence in the DNA that plays a crucial role in the process of RNA splicing.\n2. Aberrant transcripts: These are RNA molecules that are produced as a result of the mutation and are different from the normal, correctly spliced RNA transcripts.\n3. Extremely low levels: This refers to the quantity of the aberrant transcripts present in the cell.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are the acceptor splice-site mutation and the resulting aberrant transcripts. These entities can potentially lead to various diseases depending on the specific gene and the consequences of the mutation on the function of the resulting protein. For example, such mutations have been implicated in various genetic disorders, including neuromuscular diseases, cardiac diseases, and cancer."},
