It is not a disease itself, but it can be associated with genetic disorders.\n2. Markers: Markers are specific locations on a chromosome that can be used to identify genetic variations. They are not diseases, but they can be used to identify the presence or absence of certain genetic conditions.\n3. Chromosome 4p: Chromosome 4p refers to a specific part of chromosome 4, which is a structural component of the human genome. It is not a disease, but genetic variations on this chromosome can be associated with various genetic conditions.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
