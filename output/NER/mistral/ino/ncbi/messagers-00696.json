A tumor suppressor gene is not a disease itself, but its mutation or malfunction can lead to various diseases, including breast and ovarian cancers.\n2. BRCA2 gene: This is also a tumor suppressor gene. Like BRCA1, its mutation or malfunction can lead to breast and ovarian cancers.\n3. Mitotic cells: Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells. Mitotic cells are not a disease, but certain diseases, such as cancer, can affect the mitotic process.\n4. Meiotic cells: Meiosis is a type of cell division that results in the formation of gametes (sex cells). Meiotic cells are not a disease, but certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, can be caused by errors during meiosis.\n\nSo, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are the mutations or malfunctions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which can lead to breast and ovarian cancers."},
