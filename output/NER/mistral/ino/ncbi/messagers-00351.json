    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Sodium channels: These are ion channels that allow the passage of sodium ions into and out of cells during an action potential. They are responsible for the rapid depolarization of the membrane potential in excitable cells.\n2. Missense mutation: A type of genetic mutation where a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence is changed, resulting in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the resulting protein. In this context, the mutation affects the sodium channels.\n3. Normal sodium channels: These are sodium channels that function properly and recover from inactivation at a normal rate.\n4. Inactivation: A process by which sodium channels become unavailable for further activation after an action potential, helping to terminate the electrical signal.\n5. Frameshift mutation: A type of genetic mutation where the addition or deletion of nucleotides shifts the reading frame of the genetic code, resulting in the production of an abnormal protein. In this context, the mutation affects the sodium channels.\n6. Non-functional sodium channels: These are sodium channels that do not function properly due to the frameshift mutation."},
