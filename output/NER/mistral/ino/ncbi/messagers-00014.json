DMPK (Dyskerin-Muscle-Associated Protein Kinase) is a protein kinase, not a disease per se, but it is mentioned in relation to a knockout condition (DMPK [- / -] knockout mice).\n2. Ca2+ (Calcium ions) is a mineral ion and not a disease, but it is mentioned in relation to ion homeostasis, which can be affected by various diseases.\n3. ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is a molecule and not a disease, but it is mentioned in relation to ion pumps, which can be affected by certain diseases.\n\nTherefore, no specific diseases are mentioned in the paragraph."},
