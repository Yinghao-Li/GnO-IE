Protein truncation test (PTT): This is a laboratory technique used for mutation detection, specifically for identifying mutations that result in truncated proteins. It is not a disease itself.\n2. Restriction endonuclease fingerprinting (REF): This is also a laboratory technique used for mutation detection. It involves the use of restriction endonucleases to identify changes in DNA sequences. Like PTT, it is not a disease.\n3. Mutations: These are the actual diseases or health conditions being detected by the PTT and REF methods. They refer to alterations in the DNA sequence that can lead to various health issues."},
