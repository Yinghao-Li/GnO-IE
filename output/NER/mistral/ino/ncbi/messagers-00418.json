FGFR3 P250R mutation: This is a genetic mutation affecting the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, specifically the substitution of arginine (R) for a phenylalanine (F) at position 250 (P250R). This mutation is associated with certain diseases, such as achondroplasia, the most common form of short-limb dwarfism.\n\n2. FGFR2 VV269 - 270 deletion: This is a genetic deletion in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene, specifically the absence of valine (V) at positions 269 and 270. This mutation is also associated with certain diseases, such as a form of craniosynostosis, a condition where the skull bones fuse prematurely.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are achondroplasia (associated with FGFR3 P250R mutation) and craniosynostosis (associated with FGFR2 VV269 - 270 deletion)."},
