M2 gangliosidosis: It is a subtype of Gangliosidosis.\n3. HEXA gene: It is the gene responsible for encoding the enzyme hexosaminidase A, which is involved in the metabolism of gangliosides.\n4. Substitution: It refers to a change in the DNA sequence, which results in a disease state in this context.\n5. 1422 G - > C: It is a specific DNA mutation, which results in an amino acid change from tryptophan (W) to cysteine (C) at position 474 in the HEXA gene."},
