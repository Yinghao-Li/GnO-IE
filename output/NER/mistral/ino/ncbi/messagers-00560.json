In this context, it refers to the disorder being compared to Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome.\n2. Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS): This is the specific disease entity being mentioned in the paragraph.

Skeletal dysplasia: This is a broader term for various conditions that affect bone growth and development. In the context of Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome, it is specifically campomelic dysplasia.\n   c.
