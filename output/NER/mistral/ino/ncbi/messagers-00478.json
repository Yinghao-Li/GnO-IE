Consider the context: The paragraph is discussing genetic mutations found in unrelated families and the percentage of mutant alleles carrying one of two specific mutations.\n3. Based on the context, it is reasonable to assume that the mutations are likely related to a genetic disease.\n4. Therefore, the entities in the paragraph that can be identified as diseases or genetic conditions are not explicitly stated, but the context strongly suggests that the mutations themselves are the diseases or genetic conditions in question.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are the genetic mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5."},
