Genetic heterogeneity: This term refers to the observation that different genetic mutations can cause the same disease or that the same genetic mutation can cause different diseases. It is not a disease itself, but rather a characteristic of certain diseases.\n2. Splice-site mutations: These are specific types of genetic mutations that occur at the sites where the RNA molecule is spliced together during the process of making a functional protein from the DNA code. They can cause various diseases depending on which gene is affected and where in the gene the mutation occurs.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph are \"genetic heterogeneity\" and \"splice-site mutations.\""},
