HLA proteins are important components of the immune system and are associated with various diseases and conditions. For example, HLA-B27 is linked to several autoimmune diseases such as Ankylosing Spondylitis and Reactive Arthritis. Therefore, identifying these HLA types is important in the context of disease diagnosis and monitoring."},
