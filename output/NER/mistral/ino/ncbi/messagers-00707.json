Splicing efficiency: This is not a disease, but rather a process that can be affected by mutations, leading to the development of diseases.\n5. Alternative splicing: This is a process that can result in the production of different forms of a protein from a single gene, and it can be a cause of various diseases.\n6. Decreased transcript: This is not a disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of the mutation and alternative splicing.\n7. Patient: This is not a disease, but rather an individual who is affected by the disease caused by the mutation and alternative splicing."},
