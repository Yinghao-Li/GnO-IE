It is a type of diabetes insipidus that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and specifically affects the neurohypophysis.\n2. Missense mutation: This is not a disease per se, but rather a genetic change that leads to the disease. The mutation is described as encoding Gly23 - - > Val in neurophysin II.\n3. Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus: This is a more general term for diabetes insipidus that specifically affects the neurohypophysis. It includes both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms.\n4. Diabetes insipidus: This is a broader disease category that refers to a condition characterized by excessive urination and thirst due to the inability to properly regulate water balance in the body. There are two main types: diabetes insipidus due to a deficiency of vasopressin (also known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) and diabetes insipidus due to a deficiency or dysfunction of vasopressin itself (also known as neurogenic or central diabetes insipidus). The paragraph describes a specific subtype of neurogenic diabetes insipidus."},
