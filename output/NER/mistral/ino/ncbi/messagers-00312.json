    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Aniridia: A condition characterized by the congenital absence of iris in the eye. It is caused by mutations in the PAX6 gene.\n2. Peters anomaly: A congenital eye disorder characterized by a defect in the development of the cornea and iris, leading to a leakage of aqueous humor. Mutations in the PAX6 gene have been found in patients with Peters anomaly.\n3. Congenital cataracts: A type of cataract that is present at birth. Mutations in the PAX6 gene have been linked to congenital cataracts.\n4. Autosomal dominant keratitis: A type of keratitis, or inflammation of the cornea, that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Mutations in the PAX6 gene have been found in patients with autosomal dominant keratitis.\n5. Isolated foveal hypoplasia: A condition characterized by underdevelopment of the fovea, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. Mutations in the PAX6 gene have been linked to isolated foveal hypoplasia.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are: aniridia, Peters anomaly, congenital cataracts, autosomal dominant keratitis, and isolated foveal hypoplasia."},
