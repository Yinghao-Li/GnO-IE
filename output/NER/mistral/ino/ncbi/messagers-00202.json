The Von Hippel-Lindau disease is characterized by the development of benign and malignant tumors in various organs, including the kidneys (RCC stands for Renal Cell Carcinoma).\n\n2. RCC (Renal Cell Carcinoma): This is a type of kidney cancer. It is a disease that affects the kidneys and can be caused by various factors, including genetic conditions like VHL.\n\n3. Nude mice: Nude mice are a strain of mice that lack a functional T-cell immune system. They are often used in scientific research for studying the immune response to tumors and transplanted organs.\n\n4. Tumorigenic: This refers to the ability of cells to form tumors. In this context, it means that the VHL-negative 786-0 RCC cells have the ability to cause tumors in nude mice.\n\n5. Suppressed: In this context, suppressed means that the ability of the VHL-negative 786-0 RCC cells to cause tumors in nude mice is inhibited or reduced when the VHL gene is reintroduced."},
