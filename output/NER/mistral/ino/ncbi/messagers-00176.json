CTG repeat size: This is likely a reference to a genetic condition caused by an abnormal expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the DNA sequence, such as Huntington's disease or myotonic dystrophy. These conditions are characterized by an unstable CTG repeat, which can expand in size over generations and lead to disease.\n2. Size heterogeneity: This term likely refers to the variability in the size of the CTG repeat among individuals or over time in the same individual. This heterogeneity is a hallmark of several genetic diseases caused by unstable repeats.\n3. Time interval: This term likely refers to the length of time between measurements or observations of the CTG repeat size.\n4. Initial CTG repeat size: This term likely refers to the size of the CTG repeat at the start of the observation period.\n5. Further expansion: This term likely refers to the continued growth of the CTG repeat over time, which can lead to disease progression.\n\nTherefore, the main disease entities in the paragraph are genetic conditions caused by unstable CTG repeats, such as Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy."},
