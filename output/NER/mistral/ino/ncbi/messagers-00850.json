ARSA is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of certain complex lipids, and mutations in this gene can lead to various health conditions. In this context, it can be considered a disease-causing entity.\n2. Intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity: This term refers to the observation of different clinical presentations or disease manifestations within the same family. It is not a specific disease but rather a phenomenon that can be associated with various genetic conditions.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Mutations in the ARSA gene\n2.
