Mutations can lead to various diseases depending on the specific gene and the nature of the mutation.\n2. Effects on cDNA: cDNA (complementary DNA) is a DNA copy of an RNA sequence. Mutations in cDNA can lead to the production of abnormal or nonfunctional proteins, which can cause various diseases.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are \"genomic mutations\" and the \"effects on cDNA,\" which can lead to various diseases depending on the specific mutation and gene involved."},
