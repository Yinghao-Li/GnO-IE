It is often used for genetic mapping and for identifying genetic mutations.\n2. ATM locus: The ATM (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated) gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is widely known for its role in DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability. Mutations in the ATM gene can lead to various diseases, including Ataxia-Telangiectasia, a rare, progressive, and degenerative disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias, and increased susceptibility to cancer.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the focus is on mutations in the ATM locus. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Ataxia-Telangiectasia and any other diseases that may be associated with mutations in the ATM gene."},
