Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene mutation-related diseases, such as:\n   - Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)\n   - Gardner's syndrome\n   - Turcot syndrome\n   - Attenuated Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (AFAP)\n   - etc. (depending on the specific phenotypic differences observed in the affected individuals)"},
