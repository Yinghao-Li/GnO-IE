In this context, they are used as probands for pulse-chase analysis.\n2. W474C mutation: W474C is a specific mutation in the alpha-subunit precursor. It is not a disease but a genetic variation that may cause a disorder.\n3. Alpha-subunit: The alpha-subunit is a protein component of a larger complex, such as a G protein or a subunit of a lysosomal enzyme. The lack of phosphorylation and secretion of the alpha-subunit may indicate a disease state, but more information is needed to determine which specific disorder this relates to.\n4. Lysosomal alpha-subunit: The mature lysosomal alpha-subunit is not detected, which may indicate a lysosomal storage disorder, such as Pompe disease or Gaucher disease, depending on the specific enzyme involved. However, more information is needed to make a definitive diagnosis."},
