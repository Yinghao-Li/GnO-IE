Hemochromatosis: Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet, leading to iron overload and potential organ damage. It is also known as iron overload disease.\n\nSo, in the given paragraph, \"hemochromatosis\" is the disease entity.\n\n2. The mutations (845 G - - > A and 187 C - - > G): These are specific genetic mutations associated with hemochromatosis. They refer to changes in the DNA sequence at positions 845 and 187, respectively. These mutations are linked to hemochromatosis in non-Caucasian populations.\n\nTherefore, the mutations 845 G - - > A and 187 C - - > G are also related disease entities as they are linked to the development and prevalence of hemochromatosis."},
