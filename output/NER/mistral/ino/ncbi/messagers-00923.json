In this context, it refers to a change in the DNA sequence from isoleucine to lysine at a specific location (codon 1307) in the APC gene.\n2. APC gene: Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a tumor suppressor gene. Mutations in the APC gene are associated with several diseases, including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), which can lead to the development of colorectal polyps and colorectal cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
