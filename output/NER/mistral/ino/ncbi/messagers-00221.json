It is not a specific disease, but rather a description of a problematic transcript that may lead to the development of a disease.\n2. Extra 264 bases: This is not a disease, but rather a description of an abnormal condition in the transcript.\n3. Premature termination codon: A premature termination codon (PTC) is a mutation that causes a protein to be truncated or terminated before its normal completion. It can lead to various diseases, depending on the specific protein and its function.\n\nTherefore, the premature termination codon is the disease-related entity in this paragraph."},
