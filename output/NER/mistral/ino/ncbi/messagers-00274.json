It is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive absorption of iron from the diet, leading to iron overload in various organs.\n2. HFE: HFE is a protein, not a disease, but it is relevant to the disease discussed in the paragraph as a genetic mutation in the HFE gene is associated with hereditary hemochromatosis.\n3. TfR: Transferrin receptor (TfR) is a protein involved in iron transport in the body. It is not a disease, but it is mentioned in relation to hereditary hemochromatosis as it is linked to the HFE protein and may play a role in the disease's pathogenesis."},
