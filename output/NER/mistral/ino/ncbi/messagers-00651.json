Exons are not considered diseases, but they are important components of the genetic material.\n2. Introns: Introns are non-coding sequences of DNA that are present between exons. They are spliced out during RNA processing, meaning they are not present in the final mature RNA or protein product. Introns are not considered diseases, but they can cause diseases if they contain mutations that lead to abnormal splicing or if they are misregulated in some way.\n3. GT / AG rule: The GT / AG rule refers to the consensus sequence at the boundaries between exons and introns in DNA. The rule states that the intron-exon boundary should be marked by a guanine (G) nucleotide at the 5' end of the intron and an adenine (A) nucleotide at the 3' end of the intron. This rule is important for proper splicing of RNA and is not considered a disease.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph are not diseases, but rather components of the genetic material and the rules that govern their processing."},
