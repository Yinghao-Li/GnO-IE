ATM mutation: ATM stands for Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated, which is a gene that produces a protein involved in DNA repair. Mutations in this gene can lead to Ataxia Telangiectasia, a genetic disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias, and an increased risk of cancer.\n3. Leukaemia: Leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the production of blood cells in the bone marrow. It is not a single disease, but rather a category of diseases that can have various causes and presentations.\n4. Missense mutations: Missense mutations are a type of genetic mutation where a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence is changed, resulting in the production of an altered amino acid in the corresponding protein. They can lead to various diseases depending on the specific gene and protein affected."},
