The paragraph only mentions that the individuals in question were compound heterozygotes. Compound heterozygotes are individuals who carry two different mutated copies of a gene, each inherited from a different parent. This condition can lead to various genetic disorders depending on the specific genes involved. Therefore, without further context or information about the genes in question, it is impossible to identify any specific disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},

The paragraph only mentions compound heterozygotes, which is a genetic condition, but it does not specify any particular disease associated with the condition.
