    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. High-grade ductal carcinomas: This is a type of breast cancer characterized by its aggressive growth and high malignancy. It is not a disease itself but a description of a disease state.\n2. Sporadic breast cancers: These are breast cancers that occur without a known inherited genetic mutation. They are not a disease themselves but a type or group of diseases.\n3. Absence of BRCA1: This is a condition where the BRCA1 gene is not expressed or present in the body. BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene, and its absence can contribute to the development of breast cancer. Therefore, it can be considered a risk factor or a predisposing condition for breast cancer.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. High-grade ductal carcinomas\n2. Sporadic breast cancers\n3. Breast cancer (implied but not explicitly mentioned)\n\nNote that the absence of BRCA1 is not a disease itself but a condition that can increase the risk of developing breast cancer."},
