It is a genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, among other symptoms. The term \"myotonic dystrophy patients\" also implies that this condition is the disease in question.\n\n2. Somatic CTG repeat length heterogeneity: This refers to the variation in the number of CTG repeats in the DNA of different cells in the body of a myotonic dystrophy patient. This variation is considered a disease-related condition, as it contributes to the progression and heterogeneity of the disease symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are Myotonic dystrophy and Somatic CTG repeat length heterogeneity."},
