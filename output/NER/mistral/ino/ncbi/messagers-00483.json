Beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A enzyme)\n\nThe given paragraph discusses the cause of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), which is a type of gangliosidosis (Type 1). The disease is caused by mutations in the HEXA gene, which encodes the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A). These mutations result in the abolishment of Hex A enzyme activity.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to diseases in this paragraph are Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), gangliosidosis, and Type 1. Additionally, the mutations in the HEXA gene and the absence of Hex A enzyme activity are also related to the disease."},
