It results in difficulty in hearing or complete loss of hearing in the affected ear.\n2. Piebaldism: Piebaldism is a genetic condition characterized by the absence of melanin in patches of the skin and hair. It is caused by mutations in the KIT gene.\n3. Waardenburg syndrome: Waardenburg syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of melanin pigmentation and the nerves of the inner ear. It is characterized by hearing loss, white forelock, and pigmentation abnormalities.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are:\n\n1. Sensorineural deafness\n2.
