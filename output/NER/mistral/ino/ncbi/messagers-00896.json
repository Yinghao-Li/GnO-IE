However, various diseases can affect cardiomyocytes, such as cardiomyopathies.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph itself does not directly mention any diseases or conditions, but it discusses the absence of Lamin B1 in cardiomyocyte nuclei and its role in the localization of emerin to the nuclear lamina."},
