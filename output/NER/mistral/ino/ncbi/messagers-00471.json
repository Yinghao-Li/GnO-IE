The ATM gene provides instructions for making a protein called ATM serine/threonine kinase, which plays a crucial role in the cell's response to DNA damage. Mutations in the ATM gene can lead to various diseases, including Ataxia-Telangiectasia, a genetic disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration, increased susceptibility to infections, and an increased risk of cancer.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ataxia-Telangiectasia\n2. Cerebellar degeneration\n3. Increased susceptibility to infections\n4. Increased risk of cancer."},
