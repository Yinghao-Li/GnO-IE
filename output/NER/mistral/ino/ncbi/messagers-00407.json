DM (Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophies)\n2. CUG-BP: This is likely a reference to a specific RNA binding protein, probably the CUG-binding protein, which is involved in posttranscriptional regulation of genes. The \"CUG\" part refers to a specific sequence of nucleotides (CUG) in RNA that this protein binds to.\n\nSo, the paragraph suggests that altered expression of genes regulated by CUG-BP may contribute to the pathogenesis (development or progression) of DM (Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophies)."},
