In this context, mutations are the cause of the mentioned health conditions, but they are not the diseases themselves.\n\n2. Premature termination codons: Premature termination codons are not diseases but rather the result of certain mutations. They can lead to various inherited disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's disease, among others.\n\n3. C6 null alleles: C6 null alleles refer to a genetic variation in the C6 gene, which can lead to a deficiency in the C6 component of the complement system. This deficiency can result in various conditions, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n\nSo, the diseases mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cystic fibrosis\n2. Duchenne muscular dystrophy\n3. Huntington's disease\n4. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\n5. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome."},
