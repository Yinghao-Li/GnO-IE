    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. W474C: This is likely a mutation in the alpha-subunit, rather than a disease itself. It's mentioned as the specific mutation in the alpha-subunit that was co-expressed with the beta-subunit.\n2. alpha-subunit: This is a protein, not a disease. It's mentioned several times in the paragraph, and it's the protein that contains the W474C mutation.\n3. Hex A (alphabeta): This is likely a glycoprotein, not a disease. It's the product of the co-expression of the W474C-containing alpha-subunit and the beta-subunit.\n4. TSD: This stands for Tay-Sachs Disease, which is a genetic disorder. It's mentioned as a comparison for the lower level of the alpha-subunit in the W474C-containing cells compared to normal alpha-subunit transfections.\n5. infantile TSD: This is a specific form of Tay-Sachs Disease, which is mentioned as having even lower levels of the alpha-subunit in cells transfected with an alpha-subunit associated with it."},
