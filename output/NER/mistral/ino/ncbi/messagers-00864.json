These conditions can result in vision impairment or blindness.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"human congenital eye malformations\" and the specific types mentioned in the condition (anophthalmia, microphthalmia, coloboma, etc.) that result from missense mutations in the PAX6 paired domain."},
