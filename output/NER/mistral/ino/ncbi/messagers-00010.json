ATM gene: This is a specific gene that is inactivated in the tumors.\n3. Somatic inactivation: This refers to the alteration or mutation of the gene in the somatic cells (non-germline cells) of an organism, leading to the development of a disease.\n4. Tumor suppressor: ATM gene functions as a tumor suppressor when it is inactivated in the tumors, meaning it helps prevent the uncontrolled cell growth that leads to cancer."},
