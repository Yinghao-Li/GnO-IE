Hemochromatosis is a type of disease characterized by excessive absorption of iron from the diet. However, in this context, it's mentioned as a protein that interacts with beta2-microglobulin.\n\n2. beta2-microglobulin (beta2m): This is a protein that is often associated with HFE in the context of HLA class I antigen presentation. Deficiencies or mutations in beta2m can lead to various diseases, such as Bartter syndrome type 5 and certain types of amyloidosis.\n\n3. mutation: This term refers to a change in the DNA sequence that can lead to various health conditions, including diseases.\n\n4. ability of HFE to associate with beta2m: This refers to the interaction between HFE and beta2m proteins. Dysfunction in this interaction can lead to diseases, such as hemochromatosis or other conditions related to HLA class I antigen presentation.\n\n5. prevents cell-surface expression: This refers to the inability of the HFE protein to reach the cell surface when it cannot associate with beta2m. This can lead to various health issues, including hemochromatosis."},
