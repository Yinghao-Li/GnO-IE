It is not a disease, but rather a change in the DNA sequence that can lead to the development of a disease.\n2. arylsulfatase A: This is an enzyme, specifically an arylsulfatase. It is not a disease, but a protein that plays a role in metabolic processes.\n3. metachromatic leukodystrophy: This is a disease. It is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase A.
