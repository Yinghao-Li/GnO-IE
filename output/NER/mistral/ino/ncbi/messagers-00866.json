PAX6 mutations: These are alterations in the DNA sequence of the PAX6 gene, which can lead to aniridia. Mutations are changes in the genetic material that can cause diseases or conditions.\n3. Nonsense mutations: These are genetic mutations that result in the premature termination of protein synthesis. They can lead to aniridia.\n4. Splicing mutations: These are genetic mutations that affect the process of RNA splicing, which can lead to the production of an abnormal protein or the absence of a functional protein. They can cause aniridia.\n5. Insertions and deletions: These are genetic mutations that involve the addition or removal of nucleotides in the DNA sequence, respectively. They can lead to premature truncation of the PAX6 protein and cause aniridia.\n6. Missense mutations: These are genetic mutations that result in the substitution of one amino acid with another in the protein sequence. They account for a very small percentage of PAX6 mutations in aniridia patients."},
