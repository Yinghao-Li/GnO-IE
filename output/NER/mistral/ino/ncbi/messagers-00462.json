Wilms' tumor is a type of kidney cancer, and WT1 is often associated with the development and progression of this disease.\n2. Dax-1: It is a gene that encodes a nuclear receptor protein called Dax1. Dax1 is involved in the development and differentiation of the testis and is associated with certain genetic disorders, such as adrenal hypoplasia congenita, when mutated.\n3. SF-1: It is a gene that encodes a nuclear receptor protein called steroidogenic factor 1. SF-1 plays a crucial role in the development and function of the adrenal glands and the gonads, including the testis. It is also associated with certain endocrine disorders, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, when mutated.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph that can be considered \"Disease\" are:\n\n1.
