However, some of these mutations can cause or be associated with various diseases. For example, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which are more common in certain ethnicities, are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. So, in a broader sense, the term \"ethnic mutations\" can be considered as a disease or health condition when they lead to diseases."},

Therefore, the only relevant disease entities in the paragraph are the diseases associated with these ethnic mutations. Since the paragraph does not mention any specific diseases, it is impossible to identify them without additional context. However, some common ethnic mutations are known to be associated with various diseases, such as breast and ovarian cancers (associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations), sickle cell anemia (associated with the HbS gene mutation), and cystic fibrosis (associated with the CFTR gene mutation)."},
