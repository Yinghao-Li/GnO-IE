No specific disease names are mentioned in the paragraph, so no disease entities can be identified based on this information alone.\n2.

Again, no specific disease names are mentioned in the paragraph, so no disease entities can be identified based on this information alone.\n3. Disorders: This is a general term that can refer to any condition or disease. However, the paragraph suggests that there are multiple disorders being discussed, but it does not provide enough information to identify which specific diseases they are.\n\nTherefore, based on the given paragraph, no specific disease entities can be identified."},
