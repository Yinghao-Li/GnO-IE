Saccade amplitude: This is a measure of the range of motion during a rapid eye movement, which can be affected in certain neurological conditions.\n3. Saccade velocity: This refers to the speed of a saccade, or rapid eye movement.\n4. Gaze-evoked nystagmus: This is a type of nystagmus, or involuntary eye movement, that occurs when gaze is directed towards a particular point. It can be a symptom of various neurological conditions.\n5.
