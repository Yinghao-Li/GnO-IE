    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Pre-mRNA splicing: This is a biological process that modifies pre-mRNA (precursor messenger RNA) into mature mRNA (messenger RNA) by removing introns (non-coding sequences) and joining exons (coding sequences) together. It is an essential step in gene expression.\n2. Mutation: A mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene. Mutations can lead to various diseases or genetic disorders.\n3. 5 splice site: A 5' splice site is a specific sequence in pre-mRNA where the splicing process begins. Mutations at this site can affect the proper splicing of pre-mRNA and lead to various diseases.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are \"effects on pre-mRNA splicing\" and \"mutation at the -2 position of a 5 splice site.\" These entities can potentially lead to various diseases or genetic disorders if they impair the normal function of pre-mRNA splicing."},
