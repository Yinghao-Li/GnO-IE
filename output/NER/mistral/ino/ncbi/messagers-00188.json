A - T homozygotes and heterozygotes: These are genetic conditions where individuals have either two identical copies (homozygotes) or one copy (heterozygotes) of a particular gene or allele. They are not diseases per se, but genetic variations.\n2. Radiation-induced chromatid damage: This is a type of DNA damage caused by exposure to radiation. It is a disease or condition if it leads to harmful consequences, such as increased risk of cancer or genetic mutations. However, the paragraph does not provide enough information to determine if the chromatid damage is pathological or not. Therefore, it can be considered an adverse effect or a risk factor rather than a disease."},
