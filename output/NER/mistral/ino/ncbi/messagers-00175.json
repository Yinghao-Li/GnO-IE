It is a genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness, muscle wasting, and myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction). Myotonic dystrophy can be caused by CTG repeat expansions in the DMPK gene.\n2. DM CTG repeat: This refers to the specific genetic mutation associated with myotonic dystrophy, which is an expansion of CTG repeats in the DMPK gene.\n3. Somatic instability: This term refers to the ability of the CTG repeat expansion to increase in size in somatic (non-germline) cells over time, leading to disease progression."},
