It is not a disease per se, but rather a demographic or anthropological concept.\n2. HFE codon 282 (Cys / Tyr) polymorphism: A polymorphism is a genetic variation that occurs in a population at a frequency greater than 1%. In this context, HFE codon 282 refers to a specific location (codon) in the HFE gene where a substitution of a cysteine (Cys) for a tyrosine (Tyr) can occur. This substitution is not a disease itself, but it is associated with certain diseases, such as hemochromatosis.\n\nTherefore, the HFE codon 282 polymorphism is a genetic variation that can be linked to certain diseases, but it is not a disease itself. Ethnic differences are a demographic concept and not a disease."},
