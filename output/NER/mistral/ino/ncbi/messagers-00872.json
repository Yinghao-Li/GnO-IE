Major histocompatibility complex (MHC): This is not a disease per se, but rather a complex of genes that plays a crucial role in the immune system by determining the body's response to foreign substances. It is involved in the process of transplant rejection and in the presentation of antigens to the immune system.\n2. Properdin factor B deficiency: This is a medical condition where the body lacks the properdin factor B protein, which is a component of the alternative complement pathway. This deficiency can lead to recurrent infections, particularly with Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae.\n3. Deficiency of the second component of complement: This is another medical condition where the body lacks the second component of complement (C2), which is a crucial protein in the complement system. This deficiency can lead to recurrent infections, particularly with Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n\nTherefore, the entities identified in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
