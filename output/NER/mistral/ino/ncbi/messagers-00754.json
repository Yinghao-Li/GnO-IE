    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. I1307K APC mutation: This is a specific mutation in the APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) gene. APC is a tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in this gene are linked to various inherited colorectal cancer syndromes, including Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch Syndrome.\n\n2. hMLH1 mutation: This is a specific mutation in the hMLH1 (Human MutL Homolog 1) gene. hMLH1 is a component of the DNA mismatch repair system, and mutations in this gene are also linked to HNPCC.\n\n3. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC): This is a type of colorectal cancer that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is characterized by the absence of polyps in the colon. It is caused by mutations in various genes involved in DNA mismatch repair, including hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, and PMS2.\n\n4. Colorectal cancer: This is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum. It can be sporadic (occurring without a known family history or genetic predisposition) or inherited (as in the case of HNPCC).\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. I1307K APC mutation\n2. hMLH1 mutation\n3. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)\n4. Colorectal cancer."},
