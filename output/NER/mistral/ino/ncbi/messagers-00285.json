In this context, it is implied that the abnormal growth of cells is a disease state.\n2. PTEN: PTEN is a gene, but in this context, it is being discussed as a tumour suppressor gene. A tumour suppressor gene is a type of gene that helps prevent or suppress the development of tumours or other uncontrolled cell growth. Therefore, a mutation or dysfunction in a tumour suppressor gene like PTEN can lead to the development of a tumour or cancer, making it a disease entity.\n3. Maps to 10q23: 10q23 is a chromosomal location. However, in this context, it is mentioned in relation to the PTEN gene, which is a disease entity. Therefore, 10q23 can be considered a locus or marker for the PTEN gene and the disease associated with it."},
