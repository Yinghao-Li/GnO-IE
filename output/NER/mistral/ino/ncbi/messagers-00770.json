    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Factor H deficiency: This is the primary disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is a homozygous deficiency, which means that the individuals lack functional copies of both alleles of the Factor H gene.\n2. Factor H: Factor H is a protein involved in the regulation of the complement system, which is part of the immune system. The absence of the 150-kD form of Factor H is a characteristic feature of the disease.\n3. Factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1): This is a protein mentioned as being present in the individuals with the disease. It is a Factor H-related protein, but it is not clear whether its presence is a cause or a consequence of the disease.\n4. Factor H-related proteins (FHRs): These are proteins related to Factor H that are also mentioned as being present in the individuals with the disease. Like FHL-1, it is not clear whether their presence is a cause or a consequence of the disease."},
