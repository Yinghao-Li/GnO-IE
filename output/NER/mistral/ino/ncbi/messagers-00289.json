PTEN mutations: PTEN is a gene that, when mutated, can lead to various diseases and conditions, most notably Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. These are both inherited disorders that can increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Therefore, the term \"PTEN mutations\" can be considered a disease entity."},
