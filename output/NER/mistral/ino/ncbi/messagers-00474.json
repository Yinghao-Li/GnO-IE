Exon skipping: This is a potential therapeutic approach for certain genetic diseases caused by the skipping of specific exons during RNA processing.\n3. Premature protein truncation: This is a type of mutation that results in the production of a shorter, non-functional protein, and can cause various diseases depending on the specific gene involved.\n\nTherefore, the diseases that can result from the mutations mentioned in the paragraph are those caused by exon skipping and premature protein truncation. The specific diseases cannot be determined from the paragraph alone, as it does not specify which genes are affected."},
