Mutations: These are changes in the DNA sequence that can lead to various diseases.\n3. Exon 8 and Exon 9: These are specific regions of the DDS gene that contain the instructions for encoding zinc finger 2 and zinc finger 3, respectively.\n4. Zinc finger 2 and Zinc finger 3: These are structural proteins that play a role in gene regulation. In the context of the DDS gene, they are encoded by exons 8 and 9, respectively.\n5. Hot spot (R394W): This is a specific location within exon 9 of the DDS gene where mutations frequently occur. The mutation results in the substitution of an arginine (R) with a tryptophan (W) at position 394.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity in this paragraph is Dihydrodipicolinate succinyltransferase deficiency (DDS), which is caused by mutations in the DDS gene, specifically in exons 8 and 9, leading to the production of altered zinc finger proteins with a hot spot mutation at R394W."},
