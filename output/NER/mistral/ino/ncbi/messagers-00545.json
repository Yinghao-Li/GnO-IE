Maternal disomy: This term refers to the condition where an individual inherits two copies of the same chromosome from one parent, usually the mother, instead of one copy from each parent. It can lead to various genetic disorders depending on the specific chromosome involved.\n2. Prader-Willi syndrome: This is a genetic disorder characterized by a combination of symptoms including low muscle tone, short stature, obesity, and cognitive impairment. It is caused by the deletion or malfunctioning of certain genes on the paternal chromosome 15.\n3. Translocation: This term refers to the abnormal attachment or transfer of a segment of genetic material from one chromosome to another chromosome. In this context, it is mentioned that the translocation involves chromosomes 3 and 15.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Maternal disomy\n2. Prader-Willi syndrome."},
