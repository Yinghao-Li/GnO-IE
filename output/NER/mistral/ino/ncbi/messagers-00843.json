It is not explicitly stated that it is a disease entity, but it could potentially be a mutation associated with a disease if it affects the function of a protein in a detrimental way.\n2. W427R: This is another point mutation identified as W427R. Similar to G197W, it is not explicitly stated that it is a disease entity, but it could potentially be a mutation associated with a disease if it affects the function of a protein in a detrimental way.\n3. 390delGly: This is an in-frame deletion of a glycine residue at position 390. Again, it is not explicitly stated that it is a disease entity, but deletions or mutations in genes can lead to various diseases depending on the specific protein and its function.\n\nTherefore, all three entities (G197W, W427R, and 390delGly) have the potential to be disease entities if they are associated with a disease-causing mutation in a specific context."},
