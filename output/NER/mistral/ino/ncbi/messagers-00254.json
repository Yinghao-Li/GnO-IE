In-frame deletions: Deletions of DNA sequence that result in the loss of one or more amino acids but maintain the reading frame of the protein.\n4. Missense mutations: Mutations that result in the substitution of one amino acid for another in a protein.\n5. Mutant ATM protein: A protein with altered structure and function due to a genetic mutation.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) and the genetic mutations (in-frame deletions and missense mutations) that affect the ATM gene, leading to the production of mutant ATM protein."},
