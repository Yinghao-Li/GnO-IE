However, it's important to note that identifying a specific ethnic group in a medical context can sometimes be relevant to understanding the prevalence or characteristics of certain diseases. For example, certain genetic disorders are more common in specific populations due to genetic drift or consanguinity. In this case, the paragraph states that no significant founder effect was identified in this patient population, which suggests that they were being studied for potential genetic causes of disease.
