IDMS: This stands for Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism, which is a hormonal disorder characterized by the failure of the gonads to develop normally and produce hormones, leading to delayed or absent puberty.\n2. WT1 mutations: Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the development of the genitourinary system. Mutations in this gene can lead to various conditions, including Denys-Drash syndrome, which is associated with nephropathy, genital anomalies, and gonadal dysgenesis, which can result in sexual development disorders.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph are IDMS (Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism) and WT1 mutations."},
