These mutations could potentially cause diseases or conditions, depending on their nature and impact on the PAX6 protein function.\n2. PAX6: PAX6 is a gene that encodes the PAX6 protein, which is involved in eye development and regulation of eye growth. Mutations in the PAX6 gene can lead to various eye diseases or conditions, such as aniridia, anisometropia, or coloboma.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are mutations in the PAX6 gene and any resulting eye diseases or conditions."},
