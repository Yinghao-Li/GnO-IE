Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias: This is a type of condition or disease that is genetically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and affects the cerebellum, leading to ataxia (coordination difficulties).\n2. Spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, and 3 / Machado-Joseph disease: These are specific types of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, each identified by their respective names (SCA1, SCA2, and MJD).\n\nThere are no explicit mentions of diseases related to eye movements in the paragraph, but the context is about comparing eye movements in control subjects and patients with the mentioned forms of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias. Since these conditions affect the cerebellum, which plays a role in coordinating eye movements, it can be inferred that potential eye movement-related issues could be present in the patients. However, without further information, it's not possible to definitively identify specific eye movement disorders in the paragraph."},
