However, without further context, it is not possible to definitively identify it as a specific disease or disorder. Therefore, it is identified as a potential disease entity.\n2. Germline PTEN mutations: This refers to mutations in the PTEN gene that are present in the germline, which means they are present in the reproductive cells and can be passed down from parent to offspring. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in this gene are associated with various diseases, most notably Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. Therefore, PTEN mutations are identified as a disease entity."},
