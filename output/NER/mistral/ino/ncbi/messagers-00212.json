Auditory anomalies: This refers to abnormalities or disorders related to the auditory system, which includes the ear and the nerves that transmit sound to the brain.\n2. Dominant white spotting (W): This is a genetic condition in mice, also known as piebaldism, characterized by the presence of white spots on the coat.\n3. KIT mutations: KIT mutations refer to alterations in the KIT gene, which is responsible for producing the KIT protein that plays a crucial role in the development and function of melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) and mast cells (immune cells). In the context of this paragraph, KIT mutations are linked to auditory anomalies in mice with dominant white spotting.\n4. Deafness: This is a condition characterized by the complete or partial loss of hearing ability. In this context, it is mentioned that deafness is not typical in human piebaldism."},
