However, the context suggests that it may be related to a disease or abnormal condition, as it is being compared to normal alpha-subunit precursor levels.\n2. alpha-subunit: This is a protein, and it's not clear if a specific disease is associated with it. However, the fact that there is a comparison being made between the precursor levels of the W474C variant and normal alpha-subunit levels suggests that there may be some pathological significance to this finding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, the entities that could be considered as potentially related to a disease are W474C and alpha-subunit. However, more information would be needed to definitively determine if these entities are actually diseases or just markers of a disease."},
