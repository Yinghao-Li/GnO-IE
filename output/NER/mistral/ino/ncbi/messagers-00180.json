AGU: This abbreviation is not explicitly stated as a disease name in the paragraph, but based on the context, it can be inferred that AGU stands for a genetic disease. Therefore, AGU is the disease entity in the paragraph.\n2. Autosomal recessive trait: This term refers to a genetic trait that is carried by an individual who inherits one affected allele from each parent. It is a cause of certain genetic diseases, so it can be considered a modifier or a characteristic of the disease entity, rather than the disease itself.\n3. Founder effect: This term refers to a genetic drift that occurs when a small group of people establishes a new population, leading to an increased frequency of certain genetic traits. It is not a disease, but it is a factor that contributes to the high frequency of AGU in Finland."},
