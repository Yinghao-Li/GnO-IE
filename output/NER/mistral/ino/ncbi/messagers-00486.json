The specific name of the disease is not mentioned in the paragraph, so it remains unidentified. However, we know that it is a disease that is caused by a 4-bp insertion in exon 11 of a gene, specifically on the second maternally inherited allele.\n2. 4-bp insertion: This is a genetic mutation or variation that involves the insertion of four base pairs of DNA into a specific gene. It is a disease-causing mutation, as stated in the paragraph.\n3. + TATC 1278: This is a specific genetic mutation, which is a 4-bp insertion of the sequence TATC at position 1278 in the gene. It is also mentioned as being disease-causing.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Common infantile disease (unidentified)\n2. 4-bp insertion\n3. + TATC 1278 (specific mutation causing the disease)"},
