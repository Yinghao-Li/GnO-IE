It is not considered a disease, but rather a protein that plays a role in tumor suppression.\n\n2. BRCA1: BRCA1 is a protein that mediates tumor suppression. It is a well-known tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in the BRCA1 gene can lead to various types of cancers, particularly breast and ovarian cancers. Therefore, BRCA1 is considered a disease entity when referring to mutations or dysfunctions in the gene or protein."},
