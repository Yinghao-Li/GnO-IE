Sporadic means occurring randomly or by chance, as opposed to being inherited.\n2. PTEN / MMAC1: PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, and its mutation or loss of function can lead to various types of cancer, including prostate cancer. MMAC1 is a protein that interacts with PTEN and plays a role in cellular metabolism and response to stress. Its involvement in cancer is often linked to PTEN mutations.\n\nTherefore, the main disease-related entities in the paragraph are sporadic prostate cancer and PTEN mutations."},
