It presents antigens to T cells and helps the immune system distinguish between self and non-self. HLA is not a disease itself, but it is associated with various diseases, including autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection, and certain infections.\n2. Factor B: Factor B is a protein involved in the complement system, which is part of the innate immune response. It plays a role in the activation of the complement component C3. Deficiencies in Factor B can lead to diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).\n\nSo, the entities \"HLA\" and \"Factor B\" mentioned in the paragraph are proteins, not diseases, but they are associated with various diseases. The paragraph itself does not mention any specific diseases in this context."},
