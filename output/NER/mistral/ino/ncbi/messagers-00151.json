It is not considered a disease per se, but rather a biochemical compound. However, deficiencies or abnormalities in Hex A can lead to certain diseases, such as Hurler syndrome, Hunter syndrome, and Scheie syndrome. These are lysosomal storage disorders caused by the deficiency of the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase, which is necessary for the normal metabolism of Hex A. Therefore, the term \"Hex A\" can be considered a marker for these diseases."},
