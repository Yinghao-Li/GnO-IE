In this context, it is mentioned as a type of repeat found in these modules.\n2. LDL receptor (LDLR): LDLR is a specific type of receptor, which is a protein located on the surface of cells that binds to and removes low-density lipoproteins (LDL) from the bloodstream. In this context, it is mentioned as a type of repeat found in these modules.\n\nTherefore, the disease or medical entities mentioned in the paragraph are EGF and LDLR. However, it's important to note that these entities are not diseases themselves, but rather proteins or repeats that can be involved in various biological processes, including those related to disease."},
