Mental health wellness: This term refers to a state of good mental health or psychological well-being, and is not considered a disease per se, but rather a condition or goal. However, it is mentioned in relation to the identified loci being linked to it, so it is important to note its presence in the context of the discussion about potential genetic markers for mental health issues.\n\n2. Chromosome 4p at D4S2949: This is a specific location on chromosome 4, and it is not a disease, but rather a genetic marker or locus that has been identified as potentially linked to mental health wellness.\n\n3. Chromosome 4q at D4S397: Similar to the previous entry, this is another genetic marker or locus on chromosome 4 that has been identified as potentially linked to mental health wellness.\n\nTherefore, the actual diseases or conditions that may be associated with these genetic markers are not explicitly stated in the paragraph, and further research would be needed to determine if any specific diseases or conditions are linked to these loci."},
