Mutation: A mutation is not a disease per se, but it can lead to various genetic conditions or diseases depending on the specific mutation and its location in the genome.\n2.

The destruction of this site is not a disease, but it can impact the ability to use the NdeI enzyme for genetic engineering purposes."},
