Anhaptoglobinemia is a condition where there is a deficiency or absence of anhaptoglobin in the blood.\n2. Hp phenotypes: Hp phenotypes refer to the different genetic variations or types of the haptoglobin protein. Haptoglobin is a protein produced by the liver that binds free hemoglobin in the blood. Inheritance of Hp phenotypes can be anomalous, meaning that the inheritance pattern does not follow the typical Mendelian inheritance rules."},
