HLA haplotypes: HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) refers to a set of genes that play a crucial role in the immune system. Haplotypes are specific combinations of alleles (variants) of these genes. Therefore, HLA haplotypes can be considered as diseases or conditions if they are associated with certain diseases or conditions. For example, some HLA haplotypes are linked to specific diseases like type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. In this context, the paragraph mentions that these HLA haplotypes are common in Caucasians, but it does not explicitly state that they are diseases or conditions. However, based on the context, it is likely that some of these HLA haplotypes are associated with certain diseases or conditions in Caucasian populations.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph that can be considered as diseases or conditions are:\n\n1. 845 G - - > A mutation\n2. HLA haplotypes associated with diseases or conditions in Caucasian populations."},
