It is a type of genetic regulation that occurs in the offspring, based on the parent of origin.\n\nTherefore, the \"disease\" or condition mentioned in the paragraph is Imprinting Disorders. These disorders can result from abnormal imprinting of genes, leading to various developmental, growth, and metabolic issues. The paragraph discusses the conservation of imprinting between mouse and human, suggesting that mouse is a suitable model system to study these disorders."},
