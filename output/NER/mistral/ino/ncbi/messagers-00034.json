Mosaicism: Mosaicism is not a disease per se, but rather a condition where an individual has two or more distinct cell lines in their body, each with different genetic makeup. However, it can be associated with various genetic diseases. In this context, mosaicism is suggested as a possible explanation for the absence of a detectable mutation in peripheral blood and the presence of tumors in the patients.\n2. Retinoblastoma: Retinoblastoma is a type of cancer that affects the developing retina of the eye. It is typically diagnosed in children and can present as multifocal tumors or bilateral (affecting both eyes). In this paragraph, one of the patients is described as developing bilateral retinoblastoma later in life."},
