Meiotic recombination is a process that occurs during meiosis, where genetic material from two parents is shuffled and recombined to create genetic diversity in offspring. It is not considered a disease itself, but it is mentioned in relation to identifying the location of the WFS gene.\n2. Disease-associated haplotypes: A haplotype is a set of genetic markers that are inherited together from one parent. Disease-associated haplotypes are specific combinations of genetic markers that are more frequently observed in individuals with a particular disease. In this context, disease-associated haplotypes were used to help identify the location of the WFS gene.\n3. WFS gene: WFS stands for Wolfram Syndrome, which is a genetic disorder characterized by a progressive loss of vision, hearing, and diabetes mellitus. The WFS gene is the gene responsible for this condition.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are Wolfram Syndrome (WFS) and the disease-associated haplotypes."},
