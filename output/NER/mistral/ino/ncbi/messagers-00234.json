Therefore, microsatellite polymorphisms are genetic variations in microsatellite regions.\n2. Mutation: The passage of a genetic variation through several generations implies the presence of a mutation.\n\nSo, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases or health conditions are not explicitly mentioned. However, the paragraph discusses genetic variations (microsatellite polymorphisms and mutation), which can be associated with various genetic disorders or diseases."},
