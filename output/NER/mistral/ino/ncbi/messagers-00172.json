    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. DM mutation: This is likely a reference to a specific genetic disease or condition caused by a mutation. However, without more context, it is impossible to determine which particular disease this refers to. Some possibilities include Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Dominant Rett Syndrome, or Diabetes Mellitus, among others.\n2. Somatic mosaicism: This term refers to the presence of two or more distinct cell lines within an individual, which can arise from a single zygote due to genetic mutations occurring after fertilization. It is a condition, not a disease per se, but it can be associated with various genetic disorders.\n3. Somatic instability: This term refers to the tendency of the genome to undergo mutations in somatic cells, which are non-reproductive cells in the body. High somatic instability can lead to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders."},
