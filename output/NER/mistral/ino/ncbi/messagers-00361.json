It is associated with a disease called Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIA (Sanfilippo Syndrome), which is caused by mutations in the GALNS gene.\n2. Mutant cells: These are cells that carry a genetic mutation. The specific mutation in this context is the T312S mutation.\n3. Patients with this mutation: These are individuals who have the T312S mutation in their GALNS gene, leading to the disease Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIA.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIA and the genetic mutation T312S."},
