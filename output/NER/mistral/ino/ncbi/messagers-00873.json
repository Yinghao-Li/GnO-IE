Connective tissue provides support to various structures in the body, including bones, organs, and skin.\n2. HLA genes: HLA stands for Human Leukocyte Antigen, which is a complex of proteins that play a crucial role in the immune system by helping the body distinguish its own cells from foreign substances. HLA genes are associated with various diseases, including autoimmune disorders.\n3. Properdin Factor B allotypes: Properdin is a protein involved in the alternative pathway of the complement system, which is a part of the immune system that helps to destroy foreign substances. Factor B is a component of properdin, and allotypes refer to different forms of a protein that may be present in an individual due to genetic variation.\n4. Deficiency of the second component of complement (C2): C2 is another component of the complement system, and deficiency of this protein can lead to various complications, including increased susceptibility to infections."},
