Therefore, this is a \"Person\" entity. We can assume this is the person who retired from the team.\n\n2. Scotland\n\nScotland is a country, but in this context, it is also the name of the rugby team that represents Scotland. Therefore, it can be considered a \"Person\" entity in the sense of a team or organization.\n\n3. Murrayfield\n\nMurrayfield is a stadium in Edinburgh, Scotland, where many rugby matches are played. It is not a person, but it is mentioned in relation to the \"friendly against Scotland,\" so it is important to identify for context.\n\n4. they\n\nIn this context, \"they\" refers to the rugby team that the 30-year-old wing retired from. Therefore, \"they\" can be considered a \"Person\" entity in the sense of a team or organization.\n\nSo, the \"Person\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. the 30-year-old wing\n2.
