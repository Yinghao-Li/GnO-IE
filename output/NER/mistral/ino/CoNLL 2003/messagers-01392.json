However, they can be considered as entities representing the individual securities being traded in the market.\n\n3. Losers\n\nThese are a group of stocks or companies that experienced a decrease in their value or price during the trading period. They can be considered as entities representing the underperforming securities.\n\n4. Winners\n\nThese are a group of stocks or companies that experienced an increase in their value or price during the trading period. They can be considered as entities representing the outperforming securities.\n\n5. 75\n\nThis is a number and does not represent a person or entity.\n\n6. 13\n\nThis is a number and does not represent a person or entity.\n\nSo, the \"Person\" entities in the paragraph are:\n1. Losers (as a group)\n2. Winners (as a group)\n\nThese entities represent the collective actions or behaviors of the individual stocks that experienced gains or losses during the trading period."},
