So, it can be considered as a group of people.\n2. SAfrican: This is likely a misspelling of \"South African.\" It is not a person entity, but rather a description of the crop plane.\n3. crop plane: This is not a person entity, but rather a type of aircraft.\n4. hits: This is a verb, and it is describing an action that was taken. It does not refer to a person.\n5. pickup: This could refer to either a type of vehicle (a pickup truck) or the action of picking something up. In this context, it is likely referring to a pickup truck, but without more context, it is impossible to be certain. If it is referring to a person, then it would be the driver or occupants of the pickup truck.\n\nSo, based on the given paragraph, the only clear \"Person\" entities are the five people who died."},
