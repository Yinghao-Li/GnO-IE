It is likely referring to the number of games played by a team or the number of goals scored by a team or a player.\n\n3. 11: Number\n\nThis entity is also a number and likely refers to the number of players in a team or the number of goals scored by a team or a player.\n\n4. .353: Decimal\n\nThis entity is not a person, but rather a decimal number. It is likely a batting average or a winning percentage.\n\n5. 10: Number\n\nThis entity is a number and likely refers to the number of wins or the number of goals scored by a team or a player.\n\n6. 1/2: Fraction\n\nThis entity is not a person, but rather a fraction.
