Here's an example of how I would identify and extract location entities from a paragraph:\n\nParagraph: The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. It was built between 1887 and 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair. The tower is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.\n\nLocation entities: Paris, France (city and country)\n\nIn this example, the entities \"Paris\" and \"France\" are clearly referring to locations, as they indicate the specific place where the Eiffel Tower is situated. Other types of entities, such as people or organizations, should be excluded when identifying location entities."},
