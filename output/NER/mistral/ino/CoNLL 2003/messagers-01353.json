There: This is a vague term and could refer to a general location or a specific place, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact entity.\n2. December 1991: This is a specific time location, referring to a particular month and year.\n3. when Mikhail Gorbachev resigned: This is a location in time, indicating the moment when Mikhail Gorbachev stepped down from his position.\n4. marking the end of the Soviet Union: This is a more abstract location, referring to the end of a political entity or system.\n\nBased on the context, it appears that the \"there\" in the first sentence likely refers to the location where Mikhail Gorbachev resigned and where the person took over control of the nuclear arms. However, without more specific information, it's impossible to identify this location with certainty. Therefore, the only definite location entities in the paragraph are December 1991 and the moment Mikhail Gorbachev resigned."},
