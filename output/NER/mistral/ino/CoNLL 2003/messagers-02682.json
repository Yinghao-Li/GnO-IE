Saturday\n\nThe first two entities are not strictly \"persons,\" but they are often referred to as such in the context of sports competitions. \"World Cup\" is the name of a major international sports competition, and \"ski jumping event\" is the specific competition being referred to. If you want to be strict, you could say that \"World Cup\" is a collective entity representing the organization that puts on the competition, but it's not clear from the context that this is intended. Similarly, \"ski jumping event\" could be seen as an abstract entity representing the competition itself, but again, it's not clear that this is the intended meaning. In practice, however, these entities are often referred to as if they were persons, so I've included them here.\n\nThe third entity, \"Saturday,\" is not a person, but it is a day of the week and can be considered a temporal entity."},
