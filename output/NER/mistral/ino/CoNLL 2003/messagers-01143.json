However, we can infer that it is likely a business or organization that is planning a refunding, as refunding typically refers to the process of issuing new debt to pay off old debt.\n2. The paragraph mentions a $475 million tax-exempt offering. This suggests that the organization issuing the refunding is likely a tax-exempt entity, such as a government or non-profit organization.\n\nTherefore, the organization entities in the paragraph are likely a tax-exempt business or government organization."},
