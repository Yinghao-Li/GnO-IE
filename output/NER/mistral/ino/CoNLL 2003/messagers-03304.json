FRIDAY (An inanimate object, but often considered as a personification of days of the week)\n\nThe proper identification of entities in the paragraph would be:\n\n1. NBA (National Basketball Association)\n\nThe NBA is the professional basketball league in North America. It is a non-profit corporation based in New York City with headquarters in Secaucus, New Jersey. The league was founded in 1949 and is composed of 30 teams: 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. It is the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.\n\n2. Basketball\n\nBasketball is a team sport in which two teams, usually consisting of five players each, opposing one another in both offense and defense, try to score points by throwing a ball through the hoop of the opponent's basket under standardized conditions.\n\n3. FRIDAY\n\nFriday is the fifth day of the week in the Gregorian calendar. In Western Christian tradition, it is the memorial of the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth or Good Friday.\n\nHowever, in the context of the paragraph, \"FRIDAY\" is used to refer to a specific day of the week when basketball games took place. It is not a proper person entity, but it is often personified as a day of the week."},
