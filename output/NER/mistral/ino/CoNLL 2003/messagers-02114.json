Group: This term can refer to a collection of people or things, but without further context, it's not clear if it's an organization itself. However, based on the context, it seems to be a group of nuns, priests, and individuals from various countries.\n3. The 13 nuns: This is a group of individuals who belong to a religious order, which is an organization.\n4. Seven Italians: This is a group of individuals from Italy.\n5. Six Zaireans: This is a group of individuals from Zaire (now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo).\n6. Four priests: This is a group of individuals who are ordained members of the Christian clergy, which is an organization.\n7. Two priests from Belgium: This is a subgroup of the larger group of priests, consisting of individuals from Belgium.\n8. One priest from Spain: This is an individual priest from Spain.\n9. One priest from Zambia: This is an individual priest from Zambia.\n\nSo, in summary, there are several organizations mentioned in the paragraph: Ministry, religious order (implied), and the Christian clergy. There are also several groups of individuals: 13 nuns, seven Italians, six Zaireans, and four priests."},
