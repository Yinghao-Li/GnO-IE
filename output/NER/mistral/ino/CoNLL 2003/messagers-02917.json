Clydebank\n\nThis is a town or a place, but since the paragraph mentions \"Let's think step by step,\" and later in the paragraph, there are references to numbers that could represent scores or statistics, it's possible that \"Clydebank\" is the name of a team or organization. In that case, it would be considered a \"Person\" entity as a collective representation of the team or organization.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's impossible to be certain. If the paragraph is about a football match, for example, then \"Clydebank\" would indeed be a \"Person\" entity as a team. If it's about a place, then it's not a person.\n\nSo, the identification of \"Clydebank\" as a \"Person\" entity depends on the context of the paragraph. If the paragraph is about a team or organization, then \"Clydebank\" is a \"Person\" entity. If it's not, then it's not.\n\n2. 16, 4, 2, 10, 11, 25, 14\n\nThese numbers are not \"Person\" entities.
