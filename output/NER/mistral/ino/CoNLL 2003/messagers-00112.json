The paragraph does not contain any explicit \"Location\" entities as it is focused on bowling scores and statistics for two players named Doull and Kennedy.\n2. However, in bowling, the location of pins knocked down is an essential part of the score. In the given paragraph, the number of pins knocked down in each frame is mentioned for both players. So, we can infer that the \"Location\" entities in this paragraph are the pins on the bowling lane that have been knocked down by the players.\n3. Specifically, for Doull, the locations are 8 pins knocked down in the first frame, 1 pin in the second frame, 60 pins in total for the entire game, and 3 spares (two pins knocked down on the second roll of a frame).\n4. For Kennedy, the locations are 3 pins knocked down in the first frame, 0 pins knocked down in the second frame, 24 pins knocked down in total for the entire game, 7 spares, and 1 nail (a spare with only one pin knocked down on the second roll of a frame)."},
