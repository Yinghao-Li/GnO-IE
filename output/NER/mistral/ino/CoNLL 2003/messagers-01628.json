In the context of agriculture or livestock farming, they are often referred to as \"livestock\" or \"cattle,\" and the term \"person\" is not typically used to describe them. But since the paragraph uses the terms \"Cow\" and \"Bull\" in the same sentence as \"Steer\" and \"Heifer,\" which are clearly types of livestock that can be considered \"persons\" in a metaphorical sense, I have included them in the list for the sake of completeness."},
