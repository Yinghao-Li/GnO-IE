Elevated levels of CK in the blood can indicate muscle damage or injury. Therefore, CK can be considered a biomarker for various conditions that cause muscle damage, such as myocardial infarction, muscular dystrophies, or rhabdomyolysis.\n2. CK-MB (creatine kinase-MB) - This is a specific isoform of creatine kinase that is primarily found in the heart muscle. Elevated levels of CK-MB in the blood can indicate myocardial injury or damage, such as in the case of a heart attack.\n3. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) - This is a protein found in the heart muscle that is released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged. Elevated levels of cTnI can indicate myocardial injury or damage, such as in the case of a heart attack.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph that can be considered \"Disease\" are:\n\n1. Muscle damage or injury\n2. Myocardial infarction (heart attack)"},
