Sinus rhythm: Sinus rhythm is a normal heart rhythm originating from the sinoatrial node, the natural pacemaker of the heart.\n3. ACC: ACC is not a known disease, but it is mentioned as a drug or treatment in this context. It is likely to be a brand name or abbreviation for a specific medication used to treat arrhythmias.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Arrhythmia\n2.
