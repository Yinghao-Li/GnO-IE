Ischaemic coronary arteriosclerosis: This is a type of cardiovascular disease characterized by the hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries due to the buildup of plaque, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.\n2. Prolonged CPA therapy: CPA stands for cranial peripheral arterial disease, which is a type of peripheral arterial disease. Prolonged therapy implies that the treatment has been ongoing for an extended period.\n3. Hyperglyceridemia: This is a condition characterized by an abnormally high level of triglycerides in the blood. It is a known side effect of estrogen therapy.\n\nSo, the entities related to diseases in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ischaemic coronary arteriosclerosis\n2. Cranial peripheral arterial disease (implied by prolonged CPA therapy)\n3. Hyperglyceridemia."},

Ischaemic coronary arteriosclerosis: A condition characterized by the hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries due to the buildup of plaque, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the heart and potentially cause a heart attack.\n2. CPA therapy: A type of treatment, likely short for \"cranial perfusion pressure\" therapy, used in neurosurgery to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain during surgery.\n3. HDL cholesterol: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a type of lipoprotein that helps remove cholesterol from other parts of the body and transport it back to the liver for disposal.\n4. Apo A - I and Apo A - II: Proteins, specifically apolipoprotein A-I and Apo A-II, that are found on the surface of HDL particles and play a role in the reverse transport of cholesterol.\n5. Estrogen: A hormone that is produced naturally in the body, primarily in women, and has various functions including the regulation of the menstrual cycle, maintenance of bone health, and protection against heart disease. It is also available as a medication for hormone replacement therapy and contraception.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are: HDL cholesterol, Apo A - I, Apo A - II, and estrogen."},
