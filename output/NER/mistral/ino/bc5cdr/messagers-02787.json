GLS: It is a type of cardiac troponin, specifically, global longitudinal strain, which is a measure of the heart's ability to contract and pump blood efficiently. It is a biomarker used to assess heart function and detect cardiotoxicity.\n2. cTnT: It stands for cardiac troponin T, which is a protein found in the heart that is released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged. It is a biomarker used to diagnose and monitor heart conditions, including heart attacks and heart failure.\n3. ng/mL: It stands for nanograms per milliliter, which is a unit of measurement for the concentration of substances in the blood.\n4. % decrease: It represents a percentage change.\n5. AUC: It stands for area under the curve, which is a measure of the total area under a curve, often used in statistics and analysis of laboratory data to assess the performance of diagnostic tests.\n6. P: It stands for p-value, which is a statistical measure that indicates the probability of observing the current data if the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (<0.05) suggests that the null hypothesis is unlikely and that the observed results are statistically significant."},
