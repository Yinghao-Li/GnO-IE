It is not a disease but a substance use disorder.\n2. Pregnancy: This is a normal physiological condition in which a developing fetus grows inside a woman's womb. It is not a disease.\n3. Maternal history of cocaine abuse during pregnancy: This refers to the condition of a woman who has used cocaine while pregnant. It is a combination of substance use disorder (cocaine abuse) and pregnancy.\n4. Neonatal urine toxicology results: This refers to the presence of cocaine or its metabolites in the urine of a newborn. It is not a disease but an indication of exposure to cocaine.\n5. Positive at the time of delivery: This means that the neonatal urine toxicology test result was positive for cocaine or its metabolites. It is not a disease but an indication of exposure to cocaine.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are not explicitly mentioned. The paragraph mainly discusses the conditions of cocaine abuse during pregnancy and neonatal exposure to cocaine."},
