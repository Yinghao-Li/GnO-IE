The myocardium is the middle layer of the heart wall, consisting mainly of cardiac muscle tissue.\n2. Subcellular degeneration: This term refers to the deterioration or breakdown of cellular structures at the subcellular level. It is often a sign of cellular damage or disease.\n3. Marked mitochondrial changes: Mitochondrial changes refer to alterations in the structure or function of mitochondria, which are the energy-producing organelles in cells. Marked changes suggest significant damage or dysfunction, and can be a sign of various diseases, including metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiac diseases."},

Subcellular: Refers to the level of organization below the cellular level, i.e., the level of organelles and molecules within a cell.\n3. Degeneration: A process of deterioration or breakdown of cells or tissues.\n4. Mitochondria: Mitochondria are organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. They are responsible for producing most of the cell's ATP through a process called cellular respiration.\n5.
