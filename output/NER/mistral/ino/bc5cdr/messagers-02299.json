Calcium carbonate: This is a specific type of calcium salt and a common phosphate binder used in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients.\n\n2. Dialysis patients: These are individuals undergoing regular dialysis treatment for kidney failure.\n\n3. Phosphate: This is an inorganic ion that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, including bone and teeth health, energy production, and nerve function. It can become elevated in dialysis patients, leading to complications.\n\n4. Principal phosphate binder: This refers to the primary medication used by dialysis patients to control phosphate levels in their bodies. In this context, calcium carbonate is the specific binder mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n5. Hypercalcemia: This is a condition characterized by an excessively high level of calcium in the blood.
