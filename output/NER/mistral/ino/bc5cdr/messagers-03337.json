It is not considered a disease itself, but its diminished activity can be a sign of various metabolic disorders, such as mitochondrial diseases or Parkinson's disease.\n\n2. aconitase: Aconitase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle). It catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate and is inhibited under conditions of iron deficiency or oxidative stress. Diminished aconitase activity can be a sign of various conditions, including anemia, sideroblastic anemia, and thalassemia."},
