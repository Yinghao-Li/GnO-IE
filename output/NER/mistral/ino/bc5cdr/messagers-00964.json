    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): This is a neurodevelopmental disorder, not a chemical entity. However, it is often treated with medications such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, which are chemical substances.\n2. Affective instability: This term refers to emotional instability or mood swings, which is not a chemical entity.\n3. Major depression with psychotic features: Major depression is a mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fatigue, and changes in appetite and sleep. Psychotic features include delusions and hallucinations, which can be caused by various chemical imbalances in the brain, such as dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate.\n4. Family history of affective disorder, especially bipolar disorder: A family history of affective disorder refers to a history of mental disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder in family members. Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania alternating with episodes of depression. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is not known, but it is believed to involve genetic and environmental factors, as well as chemical imbalances in the brain, particularly in neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate.\n5. Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant medication. It works by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in mood regulation."},
