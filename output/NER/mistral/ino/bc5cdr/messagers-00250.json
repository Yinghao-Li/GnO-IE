Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA): This is an antibody, specifically an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) that reacts with myeloperoxidase, a component of neutrophils. It is identified as a disease entity because it is the marker for a specific type of vasculitis.\n2. Vasculitis: This is a disease characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels.\n3. Graves' disease: This is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland, causing hyperthyroidism.\n4. Patients: These are individuals who have been diagnosed with Graves' disease and have been treated with propylthiouracil (PTU).\n5. Propylthiouracil (PTU): This is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism. It is mentioned as a potential trigger for MPO-ANCA-positive vasculitis in patients with Graves' disease.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are: Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) vasculitis, Graves' disease, and vasculitis."},
