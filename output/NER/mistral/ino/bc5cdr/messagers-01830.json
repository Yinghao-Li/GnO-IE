It is responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices.\n3. Dose: This is not a disease, but rather the amount of a substance (in this case, a medication) that is administered to achieve a desired effect.\n4. PCI-recommended dose: This refers to the recommended dose of a medication during Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.\n5. 25 microg / kg / min: This is the recommended continuous infusion rate of the medication during PCI.\n6. 350 microg / kg initial bolus: This is the initial dose of the medication given at the start of the PCI procedure.\n7. Activated clotting times (ACTs): This is a laboratory test used to monitor the effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy during PCI.\n8. 300 - 450 sec: This is the target range for ACTs during PCI.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities in the paragraph."},
