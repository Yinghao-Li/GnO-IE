Tubular damage is a condition or a symptom, not a disease per se, but it can be a complication of various kidney diseases such as acute tubular necrosis, chronic kidney disease, or drug toxicity.\n2. Lipid peroxidation: This is a biochemical process that leads to the oxidative damage of lipids in the body. Lipid peroxidation is a condition or a process, not a disease, but it can be a contributing factor in various diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph that can be considered diseases are not explicitly mentioned, but the paragraph discusses the effects of DMTU on tubular damage and lipid peroxidation, which can be complications or consequences of certain diseases."},
