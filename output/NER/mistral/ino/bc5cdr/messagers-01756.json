Propranolol: It is a specific type of drug called a beta blocker, which is a class of chemical compounds used to treat various heart conditions, high blood pressure, and other medical conditions. Propranolol itself is a chemical entity.\n\n2. Fatty acid: These are organic compounds that are made up of long hydrocarbon chains with carboxyl groups at each end. They are an essential energy source for many organisms, including humans.\n\n3. Lactate: Lactate is a chemical compound that is produced during anaerobic metabolism in the body. It is a metabolic intermediate in the conversion of pyruvate to glucose in the liver and is also used as an energy source by muscles.\n\n4. Glucose: Glucose is a simple sugar that is the primary source of energy for the body. It is a monosaccharide, which is a type of simple sugar that consists of a single sugar molecule.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Propranolol, fatty acids, lactate, and glucose."},
