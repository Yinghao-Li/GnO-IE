So, it can be considered an agent used to treat diseases, but not a disease itself.\n3. SRL (Steroid): SRL is likely a steroid medication. Steroids are used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. They are used to treat various diseases, including arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease, among others. So, they can be considered agents used to treat diseases, but not diseases themselves.\n4.
