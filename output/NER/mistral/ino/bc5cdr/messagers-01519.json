It can lead to various health issues depending on which metabolic pathways are affected.\n2. Neurotransmitter dysfunction: This is a disease condition or disorder that affects the normal functioning of neurotransmitters in the nervous system. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals between nerve cells, and dysfunction can lead to various neurological conditions including epilepsy.\n3. Massive status epilepticus: This is a severe and prolonged seizure condition that can last for hours or even days. It is a medical emergency and can lead to various complications including brain damage and even death if not treated promptly."},

They are composed of various organelles and are the site of various metabolic processes.\n2. Metabolic disturbance: This refers to any disruption or imbalance in the metabolic processes that occur within the cell. Metabolism is the sum total of all the chemical reactions that occur within the cell to maintain life.\n3. Neurotransmitter: These are chemical messengers that transmit signals across a synapse, which is the junction between two neurons or between a neuron and an effector cell. Neurotransmitters play a crucial role in the transmission of nerve impulses and in various other functions in the nervous system.\n4. Dysfunction: This refers to a malfunction or abnormality in the functioning of a cell or an organ.\n5. Status epilepticus: This is a medical condition characterized by continuous seizure activity for a prolonged period of time, usually more than 30 minutes. It is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cell elements\n2. Metabolic processes\n3. Neurotransmitters."},
