In this context, it can be considered a disease entity as it is the cause of the condition being discussed in the paragraph.\n2. Ethanol: This is also a psychoactive substance and can lead to alcohol use disorder when someone becomes addicted to it. In this context, it is a disease entity as it is also a cause of the condition being discussed in the paragraph.\n3. Cocaethylene: This is a byproduct of the metabolism of cocaine and ethanol in the body. It is not a disease itself, but it can contribute to the cardiotoxicity (toxicity to the heart) that is being discussed in the paragraph.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are Cocaine addiction, Ethanol addiction, and the cardiotoxicity caused by Cocaine and Ethanol use."},
