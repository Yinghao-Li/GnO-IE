Mitochondrial function refers to the efficiency and effectiveness of this process.\n2. ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species): ROS are highly reactive molecules containing oxygen. They are produced as by-products of normal metabolic processes, but can also be produced in excess during conditions of stress or injury. ROS can damage cells and contribute to various diseases, including cardiac dysfunction.\n\nSo, in the given paragraph, the chemical entities are \"mitochondrial function\" and \"ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species)\"."},
