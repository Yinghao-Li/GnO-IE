It is a type of malignant neoplasm, which is a type of chemical entity classified as a carcinoma.\n2. Metastases: Metastases are the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor site to other parts of the body. In this context, the metastases are to the liver and lung. Both liver and lung are organs, but they can also be considered as sites for the growth of metastatic cancer cells, which are chemical entities.\n3. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses chemicals to destroy cancer cells. The specific chemicals used in chemotherapy can vary depending on the type of cancer being treated.\n4. Cardiac history: While not a chemical entity, it is important to note that the patient had no cardiac history, which could be relevant to the administration of certain chemotherapy drugs. Cardiac history refers to a person's past medical history related to the heart."},
