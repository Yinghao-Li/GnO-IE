In this context, it is an exogenous chemical substance that is being administered to the animals to induce muscle growth.\n\n2. dose: This refers to the amount of the anabolizing agent that is being administered to the animals. It is a quantitative measure of the chemical substance.\n\n3. myopathic characteristics: This refers to the abnormalities or damage in muscle tissue. It is a descriptive term for the histological changes that are observed in the control animals that were not treated with the anabolizing agent.\n\n4. histological changes: This refers to the structural alterations in the muscle tissue that can be observed under a microscope. It is a result of the biological effects of the anabolizing agent on the muscle tissue.\n\n5. g: This is a unit of measurement for weight. It stands for gram, which is a base unit in the International System of Units (SI). In this context, it is used to measure the body weight of the animals before and after treatment with the anabolizing agent."},
