Arsenic is a chemical element and can be considered a toxin or a pollutant when present in excessive amounts. Exposure to arsenic can lead to various health issues, and when it occurs during early life, it can increase the risk of developing certain diseases later in life.\n\n2. Latent diseases: These are diseases that do not show any symptoms during the initial stages but can develop into clinical conditions later in life. The term \"latent\" implies that the disease is present but not yet active or manifested.\n\n3. Cancer: Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. It is a leading cause of death worldwide and can develop as a result of various risk factors, including genetic mutations, environmental exposures, and lifestyle choices. In the context of the paragraph, cancer is a disease that is of particular interest due to its potential relationship with early-life iAs exposure."},
