It does not directly refer to any specific chemical entity.\n2. Double-blind: In a double-blind study, both the participants and the researchers are unaware of which group the participants belong to, to minimize bias and ensure the validity of the results. Again, this term does not directly refer to any specific chemical entity.\n3. Placebo-controlled: A placebo-controlled study is a clinical trial in which one group of participants receives a placebo (an inactive substance) instead of the actual treatment, to compare the effects of the treatment and the placebo. This term does not directly refer to any specific chemical entity.\n4. Crossover study design: In a crossover study, each participant receives more than one treatment, usually in a random order, and the effects of each treatment are compared to the effects of the other treatment(s) within the same participant. This study design does not directly refer to any specific chemical entity."},
