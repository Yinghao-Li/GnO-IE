However, it's mentioned in the context of the study, so it's worth noting.\n2. Adrenergic response: This is a physiological response to various stimuli, including stress, exercise, or certain medications. It's not a disease, but an increased or exaggerated adrenergic response can be a symptom or complication of certain conditions, such as heart disease.\n3. Dobutamine: Dobutamine is a medication used to stimulate the heart and increase its output. It's often used in stress tests to assess cardiac function. Administering dobutamine can cause an adrenergic response, which is what the study in question was investigating.\n\nSo, the entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cocaine-related chest pain (symptom/condition)\n2. Adrenergic response (physiological response)\n3. Dobutamine (medication)"},

It is used to stimulate the heart and increase its contractility and heart rate. It is often used in stress testing to assess cardiac function.\n2. Adrenergic response: An adrenergic response refers to the physiological effects of the adrenergic hormones and neurotransmitters, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, on the body. These hormones prepare the body for the \"fight or flight\" response by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration.\n3. Cocaine: Cocaine is a powerful stimulant drug that acts on the central nervous system and the sympathetic nervous system. It increases the levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain, leading to feelings of euphoria, increased heart rate, and increased blood pressure.\n\nSo, in the given paragraph, the chemical entities are:\n\n1. Dobutamine\n2. Adrenergic response (related to adrenergic hormones and neurotransmitters)\n3. Cocaine (a drug that affects the levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin)"},
