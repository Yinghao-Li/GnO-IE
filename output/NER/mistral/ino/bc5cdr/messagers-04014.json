Sinus rhythm: This refers to a normal electrical activity of the heart, where the electrical impulses originate from the sinoatrial node (SA node) in the right atrium and spread throughout the heart in a regular pattern.

A heart block occurs when there is an interruption in the electrical conduction system of the heart. In a 2:1 S-A block, every other atrial impulse is not conducted to the ventricles.
