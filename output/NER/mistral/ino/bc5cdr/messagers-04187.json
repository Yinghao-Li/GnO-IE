Suxamethonium: It is a specific type of suxamethonium chloride, which is a quick-acting skeletal muscle relaxant and depolarizing neuromuscular blocker used in anesthesia.\n2. Atypical cholinesterase: Cholinesterase is an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Atypical cholinesterase refers to variants of this enzyme that have altered properties, such as slower enzyme activity or resistance to certain inhibitors. In this context, it is likely that the atypical cholinesterase is responsible for the unusual reaction to suxamethonium."},
