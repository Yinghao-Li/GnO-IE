The paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific diseases, but it does discuss a decrease in hemoglobin concentration, which could be a symptom or indicator of various conditions such as anemia, kidney disease, or cancer.\n\nTherefore, the potential disease entities in this paragraph are:\n1.
