Prolactinoma: Both macroprolactinoma and microprolactinoma are types of prolactinoma, a condition characterized by the production and secretion of excessive prolactin by the pituitary gland.\n2. Macroprolactinemia: This is a condition where the serum prolactin level is significantly elevated, often above 200 ng/mL. It can be caused by various conditions, including prolactinomas, pituitary tumors, and certain medications.\n3. Pseudohyperprolactinemia: This is a condition where the serum prolactin level is elevated despite normal or low levels of prolactin-secreting cells in the pituitary gland. It is not a true prolactinoma and is not associated with an actual tumor.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Macroprolactinoma\n2. Microprolactinoma\n3. Macroprolactinemia\n4. Pseudohyperprolactinemia."},

Healthy controls: This refers to individuals who do not have any medical condition.\n4. Macroprolactinoma: It is a type of prolactinoma, a pituitary gland tumor that produces excessive prolactin.\n5. Microprolactinoma: It is another type of prolactinoma, but smaller in size compared to macroprolactinoma.\n6. Macroprolactinemia: It is a condition characterized by high levels of prolactin in the blood.\n7. Pseudoprolactinoma: It is a condition where prolactin levels are high, but there is no tumor in the pituitary gland.\n8.
