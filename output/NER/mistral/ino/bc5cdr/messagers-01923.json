Coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease: This is a potential disease entity in the context of the paragraph as the use of the term \"coronary\" implies the presence of a condition related to the heart's blood vessels.\n2. Chest pain: This is also a potential disease entity or symptom mentioned in the paragraph. It's important to note that chest pain can be a symptom of various conditions, including coronary artery disease, but it can also be caused by other conditions unrelated to the heart or cardiovascular system.\n3. Cocaine use: While not a disease per se, cocaine use is mentioned in the context of the paragraph as a potential risk factor for chest pain and the need for coronary computerized tomography angiography.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Coronary artery disease/coronary heart disease\n2. Chest pain\n3. (Possible) Cocaine use as a risk factor."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Coronary computerized tomography angiography (CCTA): This is a medical imaging technique used to examine the coronary arteries, which are the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. The \"angiography\" part of the term refers to the injection of a contrast agent into the bloodstream to make the vessels more visible during the imaging process. The contrast agent used in CCTA is typically an iodine-based compound.\n2. Low-risk patients: This term refers to patients who are considered less likely to have significant complications from their condition or treatment. It does not directly refer to any specific chemical entities.\n3. Cocaine: This is a psychoactive drug that is a strong stimulant. It is typically snorted, smoked, or injected for its euphoric effects. Cocaine is a crystalline alkaloid that is derived from the leaves of the coca plant.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"iodine-based contrast agent\" used in CCTA and \"cocaine,\" a psychoactive drug derived from the coca plant."},
