While it is not a disease itself, it is important to mention it here as it is a significant context in the paragraph and is often associated with certain side effects.\n\n2. Orthotopic liver transplantation: This is a medical procedure where a diseased liver is replaced with a healthy one from a donor. The disease leading to the need for a liver transplant is not explicitly stated in the paragraph, but it can be inferred that the man had a liver disease that required transplantation.\n\n3. Neuro-ophthalmologic examinations: Neuro-ophthalmology is a subspecialty of ophthalmology that deals with the visual problems related to neurological disorders. The fact that the man underwent neuro-ophthalmologic examinations suggests that he may have had or was developing some neurological condition affecting his vision.\n\n4. (Implicit) Liver disease: As mentioned earlier, the need for a liver transplantation implies that the man had a liver disease. However, the specific type of liver disease is not mentioned in the paragraph."},
