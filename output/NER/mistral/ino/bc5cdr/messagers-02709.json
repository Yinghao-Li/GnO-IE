ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species): ROS are not considered a disease per se, but rather a group of compounds that can cause damage to cells and tissues when produced in excess. They are markers of oxidative stress, which can lead to various diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.\n2. Nitrite: Nitrite is a marker of nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. In excess, nitrite can lead to various health issues, including methemoglobinemia, a condition that reduces the ability of hemoglobin to transport oxygen in the blood, and nitrosamines, which are known carcinogens.\n3. Ca (2+) (Calcium Ions): Calcium ion imbalance is a condition that can lead to various diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and osteoporosis.\n4. Excitotoxicity: Excitotoxicity is a condition where excessive activation of excitatory neurotransmitter receptors leads to cell damage and death. It is a major contributor to various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke."},
