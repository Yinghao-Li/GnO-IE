    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Neutropenia: A medical condition characterized by a decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, in the blood. Neutropenia is a side effect of certain medications and treatments, including CCNU (lomustine) and CTX (cyclophosphamide).\n\n2. CCNU (lomustine): A type of alkylating chemotherapeutic agent used to treat various types of cancer, including brain tumors and Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n3. CTX (cyclophosphamide): A type of alkylating chemotherapeutic agent used to treat various types of cancer, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.\n\n4. Grade 4 neutropenia: A severe form of neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 500 cells/mmÂ³. This level of neutropenia increases the risk of infections and requires medical intervention.\n\n5. Confidence interval (CI): A statistical range that indicates the reliability of an estimate. In this context, the CI for the frequency of grade 4 neutropenia after the first treatment of CCNU/CTX provides an estimate of the likely range of values for the true percentage of patients experiencing this side effect.\n\n6. Percentage (30%): The frequency of an event or condition, expressed as a proportion of the total number of cases. In this context, the percentage represents the proportion of patients who experienced grade 4 neutropenia after the first treatment of CCNU/CTX."},
