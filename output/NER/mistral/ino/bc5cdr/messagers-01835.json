HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia): A condition where the use of heparin leads to the development of antibodies against heparin-platelet factor 4 complex, resulting in thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and an increased risk of thrombosis.\n\n2. Argatroban therapy: A treatment for HIT, which is an alternative to heparin. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor used to prevent and treat thrombosis in patients with HIT.\n\n3. PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention): A medical procedure used to improve blood flow to the heart by opening narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. It is also known as angioplasty or coronary angioplasty.\n\n4. Thromboses: Blood clots that form in the blood vessels, which can obstruct blood flow and cause various health issues, including heart attacks and strokes.\n\n5. Argatroban medication errors: Errors or mistakes made during the administration or management of argatroban therapy, which can lead to adverse effects or complications."},
