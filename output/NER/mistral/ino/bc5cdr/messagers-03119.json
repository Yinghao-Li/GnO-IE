Isoproterenol: It is a medication and a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, which is used to treat various heart conditions such as bronchial asthma, bradycardia, and heart failure. It acts by increasing the heart rate, cardiac output, and bronchodilation. However, it is not considered a disease itself.\n2. Left ventricular systolic pressure: It refers to the pressure within the left ventricle during contraction. High left ventricular systolic pressure can be a sign of various heart conditions such as hypertension, aortic stenosis, or heart failure.\n3. Myocardial contractility: It is the ability of the heart muscle to contract effectively and efficiently. Reduced myocardial contractility can be a sign of various heart conditions such as heart failure, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy.\n4. LVdp / dtmax and LVdp / dtmin: These are indices of left ventricular pressure development during contraction and relaxation, respectively. Abnormal values of these indices can indicate various heart conditions such as heart failure, hypertension, or valvular disease."},
