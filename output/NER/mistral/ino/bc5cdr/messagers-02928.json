It is characterized by the production of an abnormal protein called IgM macroglobulin, which can lead to various complications, including hyperviscosity syndrome and neuropathy.\n2. Necrotising fasciitis: This is a bacterial infection that affects the deep layers of the fascia, which is the connective tissue under the skin. It is characterized by tissue damage, inflammation, and necrosis (tissue death).\n3. Bortezomib: This is a medication used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. It works by inhibiting the activity of a protein called proteasome, which is involved in the breakdown of other proteins in the cell.\n4. High-dose dexamethasone: This is a corticosteroid medication used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. It is often used in the treatment of various types of cancer, including Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia.\n5. Rituximab: This is a monoclonal antibody medication used to treat various types of cancer, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It works by targeting and destroying specific cells in the immune system.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia\n2.

IgM is a type of immunoglobulin, which is a class of proteins that plays a crucial role in the immune system.\n2. Bortezomib: This is a proteasome inhibitor, which is a type of medication used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. It works by inhibiting the activity of proteasomes, which are enzymes that break down proteins in the cell.\n3. High-dose dexamethasone: Dexamethasone is a type of steroid medication that is used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. It is often used in the treatment of various types of cancer, including Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia.\n4. Rituximab: This is a monoclonal antibody, which is a type of medication used to treat various types of cancer and autoimmune diseases. It works by targeting and destroying specific cells in the body, in this case, B cells that produce the abnormal protein in Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia.\n5. Neutropenia: This is a condition characterized by a low number of neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections.\n6. Necrotising fasciitis: This is a bacterial infection that causes tissue death and inflammation of the fascia, which is the connective tissue that covers the muscles and organs. The specific bacteria that cause this infection are not mentioned in the paragraph."},
