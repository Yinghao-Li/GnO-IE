It is characterized by twisting or \"torsion\" of the points of the heart's electrical activity on an electrocardiogram (ECG).\n2. d, l - sotalol: This is a medication used to treat various heart conditions, including arrhythmias. It is a type of beta-blocker and class III antiarrhythmic drug. The \"d, l\" prefix indicates that it is a racemic mixture of the dextro and levo isomers of sotalol.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"torsades de pointes\" and the condition that led to it, which is likely an adverse reaction to the medication \"d, l - sotalol.\""},
