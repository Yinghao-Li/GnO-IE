It is not a disease but rather a drug used to treat certain diseases.\n3. Cumulative incidence: Cumulative incidence is a statistical term used to describe the probability of developing a disease or condition over a certain period of time. It is not a disease itself but rather a measure of the risk or prevalence of a disease.\n\nTherefore, the main disease entities in the paragraph are \"persistent leukocyturia\" and the underlying conditions or diseases that cause it."},
