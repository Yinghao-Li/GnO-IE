Treated patients: This phrase does not refer to any specific chemical entities. It describes the status of the patients.\n3. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder, not a chemical entity. However, it is often associated with imbalances in various neurotransmitter systems in the brain, such as dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate.\n4. Intravenous glucose tolerance test: This is a medical test that involves the administration of glucose intravenously to assess the body's response. Glucose is a simple sugar that is a major source of energy for the body.\n5. Bergman minimal model analysis: This is a mathematical model used to analyze the data obtained from the intravenous glucose tolerance test. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a tool used to understand the metabolic processes in the body."},
