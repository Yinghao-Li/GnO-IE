While it's not explicitly stated that these individuals have a disease, it's a common term used in medical contexts and often implies the presence of a health condition.\n2. Side effects: Side effects are unwanted or adverse reactions to a medical treatment, including prescription drugs, vaccines, or surgical procedures. These reactions can range from mild to severe and may be temporary or long-lasting.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph that can be considered diseases or health conditions are not explicitly mentioned, but the context implies that the patients may have various underlying diseases or conditions that require medical treatment, leading to the need for monitoring for side effects."},
