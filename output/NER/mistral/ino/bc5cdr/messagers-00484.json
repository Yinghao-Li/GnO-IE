CK-MB is a specific type of creatine kinase, an enzyme found in the heart, and its levels in the blood increase when there is heart muscle damage.\n2. Cardiac death: This is the death of the heart or the cessation of its function.\n3. Significant coronary disease: This refers to a severe blockage or narrowing of the coronary arteries, which can reduce blood flow to the heart and lead to various complications, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks."},

It is released into the bloodstream when there is damage to the heart muscle.\n2. ng/mL: nanograms per milliliter is a unit of measurement for the concentration of a substance in a solution.\n3. total CK: Creatine Kinase is another type of muscle enzyme. It is present in both cardiac and skeletal muscles. The total CK level in the blood can indicate muscle damage, but it is not specific to heart muscle damage.\n4. relative index: This is a calculated value based on the ratio of CK-MB to total CK. It is used to help diagnose acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).\n5. 8 ng/mL: This is a specific concentration level of CK-MB.\n6. 4: This is a threshold value for the relative index.\n7. cardiac death: This is a clinical outcome related to heart disease.\n8. significant coronary disease: This is a clinical outcome related to heart disease, specifically referring to a condition where more than 50% of the coronary arteries are blocked or narrowed."},
