In this context, it is being used as a control or placebo in the tests. Therefore, it can be considered as a \"Disease\" or \"Condition\" entity, specifically an \"Iatrogenic Disease\" or \"Treatment\" in this context.\n2. hCRH (human Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone): It is a hormone that stimulates the pituitary gland to release other hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and growth hormone. In this context, it is being administered intravenously in one of the tests. Therefore, it can be considered as a \"Disease\" or \"Condition\" entity, specifically a \"Pharmacological Agent\" or \"Medication.\"\n3. TRH (Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone): It is a hormone that stimulates the pituitary gland to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4). In this context, it is being administered intravenously in one of the tests. Therefore, it can also be considered as a \"Disease\" or \"Condition\" entity, specifically a \"Pharmacological Agent\" or \"Medication.\"\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
