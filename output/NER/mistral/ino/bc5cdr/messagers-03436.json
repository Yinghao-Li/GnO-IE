Haloperidol: This is a specific type of chemical called an antipsychotic medication. It works by blocking the dopamine receptors in the brain.\n3. High-dose amphetamine: Amphetamine is a type of chemical called a stimulant drug. It increases the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, leading to increased alertness, attention, and energy. \"High-dose\" refers to a larger than normal amount of this drug.\n4. Seizures: Seizures are a type of electrical disturbance in the brain that can cause various symptoms, including convulsions, loss of consciousness, and abnormal behavior. They are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which can be due to various underlying conditions or chemical imbalances."},
