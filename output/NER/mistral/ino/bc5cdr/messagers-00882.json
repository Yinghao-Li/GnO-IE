Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. A decrease in hemoglobin levels can indicate various conditions such as anemia, blood loss, or other health issues. Therefore, \"fall in hemoglobin concentrations\" can be considered a disease or health condition.\n2. Anemia (implied): Anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. The paragraph mentions a fall in hemoglobin concentrations of 2 g / dL or more, which is a common symptom of anemia. Therefore, anemia can be considered a disease entity that is implied in the paragraph."},
