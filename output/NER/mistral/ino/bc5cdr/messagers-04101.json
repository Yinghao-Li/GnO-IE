Therefore, asthma and COPD can be considered as the potential \"Disease\" entities in this context.\n\n2. Ritodrin HCl: Ritodrin is a short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator, which is used to treat bronchospasms and asthma. Asthma is the potential \"Disease\" entity in this context.\n\n3. Healthy subjects: Although not a disease, it is important to note that the study was conducted on healthy subjects. However, the absence of any disease condition in the subjects is an essential prerequisite for conducting such a study. Therefore, the \"Healthy\" state can also be considered as a context in this paragraph."},
