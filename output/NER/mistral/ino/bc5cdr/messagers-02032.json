It refers to the sudden and often severe loss of kidney function.\n2. HD - MTX therapy: This is a treatment or therapy that may have contributed to the development of acute renal failure. HD likely refers to hemodialysis, a medical procedure used to remove waste and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys are not functioning properly. MTX stands for Methotrexate, a medication commonly used to treat various conditions including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis.\n3. Congenital biliary atresia: This is a pre-existing condition of the patient. It is a rare condition where the bile ducts are absent or severely narrowed from birth, leading to the buildup of bile in the liver and eventual damage.\n4. Living-related liver transplantation: This is a medical procedure that the patient underwent to treat congenital biliary atresia. It involves transplanting a portion of a healthy liver from a living donor into the patient.\n5. Three-year-old boy: This is not a disease, but it is important to mention as it describes the age of the patient."},

HD: This stands for Hemodialysis, which is a medical treatment used to remove waste and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys are not functioning properly.

MTX: This stands for Methotrexate, which is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various conditions including cancer, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. It is an antifolate drug that inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, preventing the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, which is necessary for the production of thymidylate and purines.\n3. Living-related liver transplantation: This is a surgical procedure in which a portion of a living donor's liver is removed and transplanted into the recipient. It does not contain any specific chemical entities.\n4. Congenital biliary atresia: This is a rare condition in which the bile ducts are absent or severely narrowed from birth. It does not contain any specific chemical entities.\n5. Three-year-old boy: This is a description of the patient's age and does not contain any specific chemical entities.\n6. Ileostomy: This is a surgical procedure in which an opening is made in the abdominal wall to allow waste to exit the body through a pouch outside the body. It does not contain any specific chemical entities.\n7. Liver transplantation: This is a surgical procedure in which a healthy liver is transplanted into a patient to replace a diseased or failing liver. It does not contain any specific chemical entities.\n8. Congenital: This is an adjective describing a condition that is present at birth and does not contain any specific chemical entities.\n9. Biliary atresia: This is a condition in which the bile ducts are absent or severely narrowed, as mentioned earlier. It does not contain any specific chemical entities."},
