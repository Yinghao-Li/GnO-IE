No specific chemical entities are mentioned in this context.\n3. End-stage renal disease: This is a condition where the kidneys are no longer able to function effectively, leading to the buildup of waste products in the body. The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood, and they do this through a complex chemical process involving various substances such as electrolytes, hormones, and acids. However, the paragraph does not specify which chemical entities are involved in the development of end-stage renal disease in this particular patient."},
