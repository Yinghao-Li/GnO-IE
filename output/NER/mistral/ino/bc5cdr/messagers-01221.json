EPS (Extrapyramidal Side Effects): A group of side effects caused by some antipsychotic medications, including involuntary movements and rigidity.\n3. SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism): A genetic variation in a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence.\n4. DRD2 gene: A gene that codes for the dopamine D2 receptor.\n5.

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. SNP: Single Nucleotide Polymorphism is not a chemical entity, but a type of genetic variation. It refers to a difference in a single nucleotide base in the DNA sequence between individuals in a population.\n2. 141Cins > del : This is a specific genetic variant or mutation, where a deletion of a single nucleotide (C) has occurred at position 141 in the DRD2 gene.\n3. TaqIB : TaqIB is a restriction enzyme used in molecular biology for identifying specific DNA sequences. It cuts the DNA at specific sites, allowing for the separation and identification of different DNA fragments.\n4. TaqID : Similar to TaqIB, TaqID is another restriction enzyme used in molecular biology.\n5. Ser311Cys : This is a specific genetic variant or mutation, where a substitution of a serine (Ser) with a cysteine (Cys) has occurred at position 311 in the DRD2 gene.\n6. rs6275 and rs6277 : These are specific genetic variants or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the identifiers rs6275 and rs6277, respectively.\n7. chlorpromazine : Chlorpromazine is a chemical entity, specifically an antipsychotic medication used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia and other mental disorders."},
