Renal function: This term refers to the functions of the kidneys, including filtering waste and excess fluids from the body, regulating electrolyte levels, and producing hormones that help maintain bone health and produce red blood cells. It is not a disease per se, but rather a function that can be affected by various diseases or conditions.\n\nTherefore, no specific disease entity can be identified in the given paragraph."},

No specific chemical entities are mentioned in this term.\n3. Alcalinization: Alkalinization is a process that increases the pH level of a solution, making it more basic. The chemical entity involved in alkalinization is typically a base, such as sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3). However, the paragraph does not specify which base was used for alkalinization. Therefore, the chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is implicit and not explicitly stated."},
