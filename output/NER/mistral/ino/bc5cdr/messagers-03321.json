    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Decreased sensation: This could be a symptom of various neurological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, or mononeuropathy. It is important to note that decreased sensation can also be caused by conditions unrelated to neurological disorders.\n2. Paresthesia: Paresthesia is a medical condition characterized by abnormal sensations, such as tingling, prickling, burning, or numbness of the skin. It can be a symptom of various neurological conditions, including peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, or mononeuropathy.\n3. Steroid injection: The paragraph mentions that the woman received a steroid injection in her right lateral epicondyle 3 months before the onset of symptoms. Steroid injections are commonly used to treat various conditions, including inflammation and pain. However, they can also cause side effects, such as localized infections, tendon rupture, and nerve damage.\n4. Right lateral epicondyle: This is a bony prominence on the lateral (outer) side of the elbow. It is a common site for injuries, such as tennis elbow, which can result in inflammation and pain.\n\nBased on the information provided in the paragraph, the potential disease entities are:\n\n1. Peripheral neuropathy\n2. Radiculopathy\n3. Mononeuropathy\n4. Infection\n5. Tendon rupture\n6. Nerve damage.\n\nIt is important to note that the paragraph does not provide enough information to definitively diagnose any of these conditions. Further evaluation and testing would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the woman's symptoms."},
