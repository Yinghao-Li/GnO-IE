It is a complex and not fully understood process, but it is believed to involve various cellular and molecular changes, including oxidative stress.\n2. Cognitive deficits: This refers to a decrease or impairment in cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. Cognitive deficits can be caused by various conditions, including neurological disorders, brain injuries, and diseases.\n3. Oxidative stress: This is a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful molecules. Oxidative stress can damage various cellular components, including proteins, lipids, and DNA, and is implicated in various diseases, including neurological disorders such as epilepsy and cognitive deficits.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Epilepsy (epileptogenesis)\n2. Cognitive deficits\n3. Neurological disorders (implied)"},
