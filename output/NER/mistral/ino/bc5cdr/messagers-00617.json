Bupivacaine: A local anesthetic. Bupivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic used for both peripheral nerve block and epidural anesthesia.\n3. Pentobarbital: A sedative and hypnotic drug. Pentobarbital is a short-acting barbiturate used as a sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant.\n4. Rat: A species of rodent, not a chemical entity, but mentioned as the animal model used in the study.\n5. Beating rat heart cell cultures: Cells taken from a rat heart and kept alive in a laboratory setting to study their behavior.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Progesterone, Bupivacaine, and Pentobarbital."},
