Glomerular sclerosis: This is a condition where the glomeruli, the tiny filtering units in the kidneys, become hardened and scarred, leading to a decrease in kidney function.\n3. Mesangial overloading: This is not a disease per se, but rather a condition or process that may contribute to the development of glomerular sclerosis. It refers to the accumulation of excess extracellular matrix material in the mesangium, the area of the glomerulus where the capillary loops are located. This accumulation can lead to mesangial expansion and eventually to glomerular sclerosis."},
