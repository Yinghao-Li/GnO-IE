It is used as an anticancer drug, and exposure to it can cause various health issues, including cerebellar damage in offspring rats, as mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n2. Cerebellar dysplasia - This is a condition characterized by the abnormal development or malformation of the cerebellum, which is a part of the brain responsible for coordination and balance. The paragraph suggests that this condition may be induced by maternal exposure to BCNU."},
