Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2): It is a type of prostaglandin, which is a group of hormone-like substances that play a role in various physiological processes, including inflammation and pain. PGE2 is a pro-inflammatory mediator and is known to be involved in pain perception.\n\n2. Pain: It is a sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Pain is a symptom, not a disease, but it is often the result of various underlying conditions or diseases. In this context, it is the outcome or effect being studied in the clinical pain model."},

Lidocaine: It is also a local anesthetic drug. Its chemical name is 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)acetamide.\n3. Prostaglandin E2: It is a type of prostaglandin, a group of lipid signaling molecules. Its chemical structure is 5,11,15-trihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid.\n4. Cyclooxygenase (COX): It is an enzyme that plays a key role in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. There are two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2.\n5. Gene: A segment of DNA that contains the instructions for the production of a RNA molecule, which in turn produces a protein. In this context, cyclooxygenase gene refers to the DNA sequence that encodes for the COX enzyme."},
