It is not explicitly stated that they have a disease in this paragraph, but it is a common term used in medical contexts.\n2. Followed up: This term refers to the regular monitoring of a patient's health status by a healthcare professional. It can be related to various conditions, including diseases.\n3. 6-monthly intervals: This term refers to the frequency of follow-up appointments, which is every 6 months.\n4. Not less than 18 months: This term indicates the minimum duration of follow-up. It suggests that the patients have been monitored for a significant period of time, which could be related to a chronic disease or a condition that requires long-term management.\n5. Range 18-43 months: This term indicates the variability in the duration of follow-up, which could be related to individual differences in response to treatment or the nature of the disease.\n\nTherefore, based on the context of the paragraph, it is reasonable to assume that the patients in question have some form of medical condition or disease that requires regular monitoring and long-term management.
