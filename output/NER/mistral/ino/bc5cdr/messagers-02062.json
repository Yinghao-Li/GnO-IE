It functions as the resident macrophage of the CNS and plays a crucial role in various functions including phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and neuroprotection. Microglial cells are not considered a disease per se, but they can be involved in several neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.\n\n2. SE rats: SE stands for Status Epilepticus, a medical condition characterized by continuous seizure activity lasting more than 30 minutes. It is a serious neurological emergency that can lead to brain damage and even death if not treated promptly.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Microglial cells\n2. SE rats (affected by Status Epilepticus)"},

They are responsible for maintaining the health of the nervous tissue and are involved in the immune response in the brain. Microglial cells are not a chemical entity, but rather a type of cell.\n2. CCR2: CCR2 stands for C-C chemokine receptor type 2. It is a protein that acts as a receptor for certain chemokines, which are signaling molecules that help regulate the immune response. CCR2 is not a chemical entity itself, but rather a protein.\n3. SE rats: SE stands for spontaneously hypertensive rats. They are a strain of rats that are commonly used in research due to their genetic predisposition to develop hypertension. SE rats are not chemical entities, but rather a type of animal.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are the chemokines that bind to CCR2.
