Torsade de pointes (TdP): This is a specific type of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm) that can lead to fainting or sudden cardiac death. It is characterized by twisting or \"torsion\" of the electrical activity of the heart around the isoelectric line on an electrocardiogram (ECG). TdP is often associated with prolonged QT interval, which is a measure of the time it takes for the heart to recharge between beats.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, \"torsade de pointes (TdP)\" is the disease entity."},
