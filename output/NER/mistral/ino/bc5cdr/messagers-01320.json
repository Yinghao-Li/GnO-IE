It is often associated with Parkinson's disease, but parkinsonian symptoms can also occur as a side effect of certain medications.\n\n2. Akathisia: Akathisia is a side effect of some medications, particularly neuroleptics and antiemetics, that causes restlessness, inner agitation, and an inability to sit still. It is a common extrapyramidal side effect and can be distressing for patients.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph are Parkinsonism and Akathisia."},

Negative symptoms include apathy, anhedonia, and akinesia.\n\n2. Measures: Measures are not chemical entities either, but rather tools used to assess or quantify various aspects, such as symptoms or conditions.\n\n3. Parkinsonism: Parkinsonism is a group of motor symptoms and signs, including tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. It is primarily caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Parkinsonism is not a chemical entity, but rather a condition.\n\n4. Akathisia: Akathisia is a side effect of dopaminergic medications, characterized by restlessness, anxiety, and an inner urge to move. It is not a chemical entity, but rather a condition.\n\n5. Medications: Medications are not chemical entities per se, but rather substances that are used to treat various conditions. In this context, the medications are likely dopaminergic drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease. Some examples include levodopa, pramipexole, and ropinirole."},
