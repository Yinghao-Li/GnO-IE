Severe hypoxaemia: This is a medical condition characterized by a decrease in the amount of oxygen in the blood, leading to insufficient oxygen supply to the body's tissues. It is a type of respiratory distress.\n2. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA): This is a congenital heart defect where a blood vessel, called the ductus arteriosus, remains open after birth instead of closing as it should. This can lead to various complications, including hypoxaemia.\n3. Premature infants: Premature infants are babies born before 37 weeks of gestation. They are at increased risk for various health complications, including respiratory distress and heart defects like PDA.\n4. Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief and to reduce inflammation. In this context, it was being used for prophylactic treatment of PDA in premature infants. However, it is not directly a disease, but rather a medication that can cause severe hypoxaemia as a side effect in some cases."},
