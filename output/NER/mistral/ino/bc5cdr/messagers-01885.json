Fulminant liver failure is a severe and often sudden form of liver injury or failure. Acetaminophen is a common cause of drug-induced liver injury.\n2. AKI (Acute Kidney Injury): This is a secondary condition or complication mentioned in the paragraph. Acute kidney injury is a sudden decrease in kidney function, which can lead to a buildup of waste products in the body.\n3. Liver transplantation: While not a disease itself, liver transplantation is a medical procedure performed to treat end-stage liver disease or liver failure. In this case, it is mentioned as a treatment for the patient's fulminant liver failure."},
