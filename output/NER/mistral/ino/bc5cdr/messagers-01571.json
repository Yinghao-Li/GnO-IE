    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Lack of effects: This term is not a disease entity, but rather a description of the situation or condition being discussed.\n2. Low contribution of de novo synthesis: \"De novo synthesis\" refers to the process by which a molecule is synthesized de novo, or anew, within a cell. In this context, it's not clear what specific molecule is being discussed, so it's not a disease entity.\n3. Cellular inositol supply: Inositol is a type of simple sugar that plays a role in various cellular functions, including signal transduction and membrane structure. A deficiency or imbalance of inositol can lead to various health issues, such as neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, and developmental disorders. However, in this paragraph, it's not clear whether the cellular inositol supply is deficient or not, so it's not explicitly stated as a disease entity.\n4. Inhibition of de novo synthesis by lithium itself: Lithium is a medication commonly used to treat bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions. One of its mechanisms of action is the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), which in turn inhibits the de novo synthesis of inositol. Chronic lithium treatment can lead to various side effects, including kidney damage, thyroid dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. However, the paragraph is discussing the potential inhibition of inositol synthesis specifically, so it's not explicitly stated as a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the only potential disease entities mentioned in the paragraph are \"neurodegenerative diseases,\" \"metabolic disorders,\" and \"developmental disorders,\" which are not explicitly mentioned but are implied as possible conditions related to inositol deficiency."},

Lithium: A chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a light, silvery-white alkali metal. In this context, it is likely referring to lithium ions, which are used therapeutically in the treatment of various conditions, including bipolar disorder and depression.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Inositol, De novo synthesis, Glucose-6-phosphate, and Lithium."},
