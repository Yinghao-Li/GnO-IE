It is a symptom of bipolar disorder.\n2. Adverse effects: Adverse effects refer to unwanted or harmful reactions to a medication or treatment.\n3. Psychomotor stimulants: Psychomotor stimulants are a class of drugs that increase activity, alertness, and attention. They include amphetamines, methylphenidate, and cocaine.\n4. Sympathomimetic agents: Sympathomimetic agents are drugs that mimic the effects of the sympathetic nervous system. They include adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine agonists.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to diseases or medical conditions in the paragraph are mania, adverse effects, and the use of psychomotor stimulants and sympathomimetic agents."},
