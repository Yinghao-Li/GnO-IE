They are often used to treat various conditions such as hypertension, angina, heart failure, and arrhythmias. In this context, they are being used to treat patients before surgery.\n2. Unintentional intravascular administration: This refers to the accidental injection of a substance into a blood vessel instead of the intended site.\n3. Levobupivacaine with epinephrine: Levobupivacaine is a local anesthetic used for pain relief during surgery. Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic amine used as an adjunct to local anesthetics to prolong their effect and reduce bleeding. The unintentional administration of this combination can have significant cardiovascular effects.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hypertension, angina, heart failure, and arrhythmias (conditions treated with beta-adrenergic antagonist medications)\n2. Unintentional intravascular administration (an accidental medical event)\n3. Cardiovascular effects (potential consequences of unintentional intravascular administration of levobupivacaine with epinephrine)"},
