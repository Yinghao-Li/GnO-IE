Decrease: This is a reduction in the amount or level of something.\n4. Significant: This means that the decrease is noticeable or important.\n5. Increase: This is an addition or an increase in the amount or level of something.\n6. Concomitant: This means happening or existing at the same time.\n7. Serum: This is the clear, liquid part of blood that remains after the clotting process has occurred. It contains various proteins, electrolytes, and other substances.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are myocardial marker enzymes (CK, cTnT, cTnI), and the activity of these enzymes in serum."},
