Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in fighting infections. So, \"neutropenia\" can be considered a condition associated with a low level of a specific type of white blood cell, which is a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Neutrophils (a type of white blood cell)\n2. Infections (which are caused by various microorganisms)\n3. Cancer (a disease)\n\nIt's important to note that the paragraph does not mention any specific chemicals, but rather describes a medical condition and its impact on the body."},
