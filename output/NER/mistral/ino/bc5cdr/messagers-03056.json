It is also a type of toxicity.\n3. Growth retardation: This term refers to the inhibition or delay in normal growth and development, which can be caused by various factors including nutritional deficiencies, diseases, or toxic substances. It is not a disease per se, but rather a symptom or outcome of various underlying conditions, some of which may be toxic in nature."},
