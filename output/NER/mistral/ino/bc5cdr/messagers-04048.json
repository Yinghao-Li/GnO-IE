Global LV function: This refers to the overall contractility and pumping ability of the left ventricle of the heart, which is a chamber that pumps blood to the rest of the body. It is a measure of heart health and can indicate the presence of various heart conditions or diseases, such as heart failure or cardiomyopathy.\n2. Significant and then progressive fall: This phrase suggests a decline or deterioration in global LV function over time. It implies that the heart is not pumping blood as effectively as it once did, which can lead to symptoms of heart failure or other complications.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph that relate to diseases are:\n\n1. Global LV function decline or deterioration\n2. Heart failure (implied by the description of a significant and progressive fall in global LV function)\n3. Cardiomyopathy (another potential underlying condition that can cause a decline in global LV function)"},
