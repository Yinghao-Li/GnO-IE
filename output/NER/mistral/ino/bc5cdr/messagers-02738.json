However, it's mentioned in the context of children being diagnosed with it, so it can be considered an entity.\n2. P9605 children: This refers to a group of children who were part of a study and experienced more severe attention problems, along with below-average performance on neurocognitive measures. This group can be considered a subgroup of children with attention problems.\n3. P9201 children: This refers to another group of children who were part of a study and had attention problems but with less severe neurocognitive deficits compared to the P9605 group. This group can also be considered a subgroup of children with attention problems.\n\nSo, the main entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Attention problems\n2. P9605 children\n3.
