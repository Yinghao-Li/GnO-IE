They are not considered diseases but rather enzymes involved in the process of cell death.\n3. Cathepsin B: Cathepsin B is a lysosomal protease that is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, inflammation, and apoptosis. It can also contribute to the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity when referring to its role in disease states."},
