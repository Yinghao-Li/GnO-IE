It is not considered a disease, but rather a treatment for certain medical conditions.\n2. Serum sodium: This is a measurement of the level of sodium ions in the blood. A serum sodium level that is too low (hyponatremia) or too high (hypernatremia) can indicate various medical conditions. In this context, the normal range is given as 134 to 137 mmol/L, but abnormal levels outside of this range could potentially indicate a disease or condition related to electrolyte imbalance."},
