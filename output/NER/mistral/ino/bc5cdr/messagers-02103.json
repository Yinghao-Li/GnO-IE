Contrast medium refers to a type of medical agent used for enhancing the visualization of structures in various diagnostic imaging techniques such as X-rays, CT scans, and angiograms. The contrast medium helps to make the internal structures of the body more visible by increasing the contrast between them and their surrounding tissues. Commonly used contrast media include iodine-based compounds like iohexol, iopromide, and iodixanol."},
