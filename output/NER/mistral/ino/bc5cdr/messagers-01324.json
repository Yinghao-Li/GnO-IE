The chemical structure of olanzapine includes a dibenzothiazepine core and a piperidine side chain. Its IUPAC name is (1S,5S)-1-[2-[4-(4-Chlorophenyl)piperidin-1-yl]ethyl]-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-1,3-dithiolane-2,5-dione.\n\nBoth risperidone and olanzapine are psychotropic drugs that belong to the class of organic compounds called dithiolanes. They act as antagonists for dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, which is essential for their therapeutic effects in treating various psychiatric disorders."},
