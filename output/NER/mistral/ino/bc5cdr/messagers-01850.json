Dyskinesias: Dyskinesias are involuntary and often repetitive movements that can occur as a side effect of long-term treatment with levodopa, a medication commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. They can include twisting, writhing, and involuntary limb movements. Dyskinesias are a symptom of a disease, specifically Parkinson's disease, and not a disease in themselves."},
