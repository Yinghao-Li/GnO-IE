L-arginine: This is an amino acid that serves as a precursor for nitric oxide synthesis. It is not a disease.\n4. NOS (Nitric Oxide Synthase): This is an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of nitric oxide from L-arginine. It is not a disease.\n5. L-NAME (Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester): This is a drug that acts as an inhibitor of NOS, preventing the synthesis of nitric oxide.
