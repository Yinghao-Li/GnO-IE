Azimilide: It is another medication used to treat heart conditions, specifically atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias. Like dl-sotalol, azimilide also rarely induces EADs in canine left ventricles.\n3. EADs (Early Afterdepolarizations): It is a type of cardiac arrhythmia, which is an abnormal heart rhythm. EADs can lead to potentially dangerous heart rhythms, such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.\n4. QT prolongation: It is a condition where the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is abnormally long. A prolonged QT interval can increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are Early Afterdepolarizations (EADs) and QT prolongation."},

It is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers of sotalol, a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and a selective beta-blocker.\n2. Azimilide: It is another chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is an antiarrhythmic drug that prolongs the QT interval and is used to treat atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.\n3. EADs (Early Afterdepolarizations): Although not a chemical entity itself, it is a physiological phenomenon that can be induced by certain chemicals, including dl-sotalol and azimilide, as mentioned in the paragraph.\n4. Canine left ventricles: It is not a chemical entity but an anatomical part of the body where the mentioned chemicals (dl-sotalol and azimilide) were tested and did not induce EADs frequently.\n5. Rabbits: It is an animal species where the mentioned chemicals (dl-sotalol and azimilide) produced frequent EADs and more pronounced QT prolongation.\n6. QT prolongation: It is a physiological condition where the duration of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram is increased. It can be induced by certain chemicals, including dl-sotalol and azimilide, as mentioned in the paragraph."},
