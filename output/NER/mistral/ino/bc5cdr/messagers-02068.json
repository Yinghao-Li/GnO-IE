It is not a chemical entity itself, but it can trigger various chemical changes in the brain.\n2. Neuroplasticity: Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to new experiences or damage. It is not a chemical entity, but it can be influenced by various chemicals in the brain.\n3. Detrimental: This term refers to something harmful or damaging. It is not a chemical entity.\n4. Neuroinflammatory changes: Neuroinflammation is the inflammation of the nervous tissue, which can be caused by various chemicals released during an immune response. The term \"changes\" refers to the alterations in the levels or functions of these chemicals.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the various chemicals involved in neuroinflammation. These chemicals could include cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, and other inflammatory mediators."},
