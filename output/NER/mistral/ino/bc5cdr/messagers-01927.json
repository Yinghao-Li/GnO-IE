The \"C\" in CTA stands for Computed Tomography, which is a type of medical imaging technology, and \"Coronary\" refers to the heart's blood vessels.\n\n2. Cocaine: Cocaine is a strong stimulant drug that is commonly used as a recreational drug. It is derived from the leaves of the coca plant and can be snorted, smoked, or injected. Cocaine works by increasing the levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is associated with pleasure and reward, in the brain.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"Coronary CTA\" (a medical imaging test) and \"Cocaine\" (a recreational drug)."},
