PTLD: Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a condition, not a chemical entity. However, it is caused by an overgrowth of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected B-lymphocytes, which are types of white blood cells. EBV is a virus, which is a biological entity and can be considered a chemical in the sense that it has a specific genetic material (DNA).\n4. Burkitt-type: This is a descriptive term for a specific type of malignant lymphoma, which is a type of cancer. It is named after Denis Burkitt, who first described the disease in 1958. It is not a chemical entity.\n5. Malignant lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)."},
