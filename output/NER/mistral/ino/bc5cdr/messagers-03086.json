It is a red-colored antibiotic produced by the soil actinomycete Streptomyces peucetius. Doxorubicin functions by intercalating into the DNA of the cancer cells, inhibiting topoisomerase II, and generating free radicals, leading to DNA damage and ultimately, cell death. However, it can also have adverse effects on the heart, leading to heart failure in some cases, especially in children."},
