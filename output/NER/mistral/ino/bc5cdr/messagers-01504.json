    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. SNR: Substantia Nigra Reticulata, a part of the midbrain that contains a high concentration of dopaminergic neurons. It is not a chemical entity but rather a neuroanatomical structure.\n\n2. Immunohistochemical techniques: These are laboratory techniques used to detect specific antigens (proteins or other biological molecules) in cells or tissues using labeled antibodies. The term \"immunohistochemical\" refers to the application of these techniques to histological sections.\n\n3. Neurons: These are specialized cells that transmit electrical and chemical signals throughout the body. They are the primary building blocks of the nervous system.\n\n4. Astrocytes: These are a type of glial cell in the central nervous system. They play various roles in supporting neurons, including providing structural support, maintaining the blood-brain barrier, and regulating the extracellular environment.\n\n5. Time-course: This refers to the sequence or progression of events over a period of time. It is not a chemical entity but rather a concept.\n\n6. Changes: This is a general term referring to modifications or transformations that occur in neurons and astrocytes over time. It is not a chemical entity but rather a process."},

Immunohistochemical techniques: These are laboratory techniques used to detect specific antigens (proteins or other biological molecules) in cells or tissues using labeled antibodies.\n\n2. Antibodies: These are proteins produced by the immune system to neutralize or destroy specific antigens. They are used in immunohistochemical techniques to label specific antigens.\n\n3. Proteins: These are large biomolecules made up of long chains of amino acids. They play various roles in the body, including acting as enzymes, structural components, and signaling molecules.\n\n4. Antigens: These are molecules that elicit an immune response when they come into contact with the immune system. They can be proteins, carbohydrates, or other types of molecules.\n\n5. Biological molecules: These are large complex molecules that are essential for the structure and function of living organisms. They include proteins, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), carbohydrates, lipids, and vitamins."},
