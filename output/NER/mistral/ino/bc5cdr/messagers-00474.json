Persistent sterile leukocyturia: This is a medical condition characterized by the persistent presence of white blood cells in urine in the absence of a bacterial infection. Leukocyturia itself is not a disease but a symptom. However, the persistent and sterile form of it can be associated with various underlying conditions, some of which may be diseases.\n\n2. Increase in serum creatinine levels: Creatinine is a waste product produced by the muscles and excreted by the kidneys. An increase in serum creatinine levels above normal can indicate kidney damage or dysfunction. Therefore, an increase in serum creatinine levels of > 50 % above normal can be considered a disease state or a symptom of a kidney disease."},

Serum: Serum is the clear, yellowish fluid that separates from blood when it clots. It is a biological fluid, not a chemical entity.\n5.

Levels: Levels refer to the amount or concentration of a substance in a given volume or mass. It is not a chemical entity.\n7. > 50 % above normal: This phrase refers to an increase in the concentration of creatinine in serum by more than 50% compared to the normal range.
