Percentage segmental shortening: This is a measure of the contraction of the heart muscle during a heartbeat. A decrease in percentage segmental shortening could indicate a decrease in the heart's ability to pump effectively, which could be a sign of various heart conditions such as heart failure or ischemia.\n3. ST-segment elevation: This is a finding on an electrocardiogram (ECG) that indicates damage to the heart muscle. ST-segment elevation can be a sign of various heart conditions such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), unstable angina, or other forms of ischemic heart disease.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to diseases in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Ischemic heart disease or coronary artery disease\n2. Heart failure or decreased heart function\n3. Myocardial infarction or heart attack\n4. Unstable angina or other forms of ischemic heart disease."},
