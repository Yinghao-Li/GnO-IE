    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Nephrogenic DI (Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic type): Nephrogenic DI is a type of Diabetes Insipidus, which is a medical condition characterized by the production of large amounts of dilute urine due to an impaired ability of the kidneys to respond to the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin. The term \"nephrogenic\" refers to the kidneys.\n\n2. Neurogenic DI (Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic type): Neurogenic DI is another type of Diabetes Insipidus, which is caused by a deficiency or impairment of the production or release of ADH from the pituitary gland or the response of the kidneys to ADH. The term \"neurogenic\" refers to the nervous system.\n\n3. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin: ADH is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that helps regulate water balance in the body by increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys. The term \"hormone\" refers to a chemical messenger produced by an endocrine gland that regulates various physiological processes in the body."},
