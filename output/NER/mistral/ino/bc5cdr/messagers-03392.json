It does not contain any specific chemical entities.\n2. Podocytes: Podocytes are a type of epithelial cell found in the nephron, which is the functional unit of the kidney. They play a crucial role in maintaining the filtration barrier of the kidney. Podocytes are not chemical entities but biological cells.\n3. q-PCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction): q-PCR is a laboratory technique used to measure the amount of specific DNA sequences (target genes) present in a sample. It does not contain any specific chemical entities.\n4. Podocyte marker genes: Podocyte marker genes are specific genes that are expressed only in podocytes. They help in the identification and characterization of podocytes. The two marker genes mentioned in the paragraph are nephrin and podocin.\n5. Nephrin: Nephrin is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the slit diaphragm, which is a key structure in the filtration barrier of the kidney.\n6. Podocin: Podocin is a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with nephrin and helps in the formation and maintenance of the slit diaphragm.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are nephrin and podocin, which are specific proteins expressed in podocytes."},
