Myocardial infarction: This is a disease condition characterized by the obstruction of blood flow to a part of the heart muscle, causing damage to the heart tissue.\n2. Inflammatory responses: This refers to the body's response to injury or infection, which can involve various processes such as the release of cytokines, activation of immune cells, and tissue damage. Inflammation is a common complication of myocardial infarction and can contribute to the progression of heart damage.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph that can be identified as diseases are \"myocardial infarction\" and \"inflammatory responses\"."},

Myocardial infarction: While not a chemical entity itself, it refers to the damage or death of heart muscle tissue caused by a lack of blood supply to the heart, often due to the formation of a blood clot in a coronary artery.\n3. AMP: Adenosine monophosphate is a chemical compound that plays a role in energy transfer in the body.\n4. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK): It is a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a major regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. When cellular energy levels are low, AMPK is activated and helps to increase energy production and decrease energy consumption.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are metformin, AMP, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)."},
