Parkinson's disease: It is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability.\n\nSo, in the given paragraph, \"Parkinson's disease\" is the primary disease entity mentioned.\n\n2. Motor fluctuations: This is a chronic adverse outcome of long-term Levodopa therapy, characterized by unpredictable returns of motor symptoms between doses.\n\n3. Dyskinesia: This is another chronic adverse outcome of long-term Levodopa therapy, characterized by involuntary, abnormal movements.\n\n4. Visual hallucinations: This is a chronic adverse outcome of long-term Levodopa therapy, characterized by seeing things that are not present.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, \"motor fluctuations,\" \"dyskinesia,\" and \"visual hallucinations\" are the disease entities that are adverse outcomes or complications of the primary disease entity, \"Parkinson's disease,\" specifically related to the use of Levodopa as a symptomatic therapy."},
