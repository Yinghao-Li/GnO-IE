However, it is important to note that many kidney cancers are caused by various chemical and environmental factors, such as tobacco use, obesity, high blood pressure, and exposure to certain chemicals like asbestos and certain herbicides and pesticides.\n2. Associations with aggressive prostate cancer: This is a medical condition or health issue, not a chemical entity. However, there are several chemicals that have been linked to aggressive forms of prostate cancer, such as androgens (hormones that promote the growth of prostate tissue), phthalates (found in plastics and personal care products), and certain pesticides and herbicides.\n\nTherefore, while the paragraph does not directly mention any specific chemical entities, it does allude to the potential role of certain chemicals in the development and aggressiveness of kidney and prostate cancers."},
