It is a rifamycin derivative, specifically rifampicin, which is used to treat various bacterial infections.\n\n2. Segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis: This is a type of kidney injury. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis refers to inflammation and damage to the glomeruli (the tiny filtering units in the kidneys) that results in the death of kidney tissue (necrosis). The term \"segmental\" indicates that the damage is limited to specific areas within the glomeruli.\n\n3. Staphylococcal endocarditis: This is a bacterial infection that affects the inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves. Staphylococci are a type of bacteria that can cause this condition. Endocarditis can lead to various complications, including kidney damage, such as segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis."},
