Again, they do not contain any specific chemical entities.\n3. Moderate degree diffuse generalized slowing: This term refers to a pattern of slow brain wave activity seen in an EEG. The term \"diffuse\" means that the slowing is present throughout the brain, and \"generalized\" means that it is present in both hemispheres. The term \"moderate degree\" indicates the severity of the slowing. It is not related to any specific chemical entities."},
