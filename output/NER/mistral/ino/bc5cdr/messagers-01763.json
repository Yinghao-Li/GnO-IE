    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Propranolol: It is a drug that exists as two isomers (enantiomers). Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker used to treat various heart conditions, angina, hypertension, and essential tremors.\n\n2. Ouabain: It is a cardiac glycoside, a type of steroidal alkaloid, which acts as a potassium ion channel blocker and causes cardiac muscle contraction. It is found in the seeds of the Strophanthus and the leaves of the Digitaria plants.\n\n3. Anaesthetized cats and dogs: These are animals used for the experiment. They were under anesthesia during the study.\n\n4. Ventricular tachycardia: It is a type of abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid, disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles of the heart. It can lead to decreased blood flow to vital organs and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly."},
