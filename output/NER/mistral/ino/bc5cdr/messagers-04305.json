Acute myocardial infarction: This is a disease condition where there is a blockage in a coronary artery, leading to the death of heart muscle due to lack of oxygen-rich blood.\n2. Cluster headache: This is a type of primary headache disorder characterized by recurring episodes of severe pain, typically located around one eye or on one side of the head, often accompanied by symptoms such as tearing and redness of the eye, nasal congestion, and sweating on the affected side of the face.\n\nSumatriptan is a medication used to treat cluster headaches, but its administration resulted in an acute myocardial infarction in this case. Therefore, both cluster headache and acute myocardial infarction are diseases mentioned in the paragraph."},

Acute myocardial infarction: This is a medical condition where there is a blockage in a coronary artery, preventing oxygen-rich blood from reaching a part of the heart muscle. It is also known as a heart attack.\n2. Sumatriptan: This is a medication used to treat migraines and cluster headaches. It is a serotonin receptor agonist, specifically targeting the 5-HT1 receptors. Sumatriptan works by narrowing the blood vessels surrounding the brain and reducing inflammation.\n3.
