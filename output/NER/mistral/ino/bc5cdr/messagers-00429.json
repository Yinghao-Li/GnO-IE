They are not diseases, but they can be considered \"Subject\" entities since they are the ones undergoing the toxicity caused by cyclophosphamide.\n\n3. Female mouse: This is the species and gender of the subject animals in the study. It is not a disease, but it can also be considered a \"Subject\" entity.\n\n4. Delayed toxicity: This is the condition or effect caused by the cyclophosphamide on the bladder of the female mice. It is the \"Disease\" entity in the paragraph.\n\n5.
