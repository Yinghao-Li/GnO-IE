It is a common source of calcium used in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism and milk-alkali syndrome.\n2. Calcitriol: Calcitriol is a form of vitamin D3, specifically the active form. It is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the regulation of calcium and phosphate levels in the body.\n3. Milk-alkali syndrome: Milk-alkali syndrome is a condition that can occur when a person consumes large amounts of milk and alkali, such as calcium carbonate, over an extended period. It can lead to various health issues, including kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are calcium carbonate and calcitriol."},
