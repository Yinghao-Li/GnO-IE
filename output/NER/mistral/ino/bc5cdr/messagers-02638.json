However, in this context, it seems like an abbreviation for a biomarker or a measure of some biological response. Without further context, it's difficult to definitively say it's a chemical entity.\n2. Bevacizumab: This is a monoclonal antibody medication used for cancer treatment. It specifically targets a protein called VEGF-A, which plays a role in angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels).\n3. Irinotecan: This is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including colorectal and small cell lung cancer. It works by inhibiting the enzyme topoisomerase I, which is involved in DNA replication and transcription.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are bevacizumab and irinotecan."},
