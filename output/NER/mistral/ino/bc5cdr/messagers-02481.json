It is a monomeric form of lactose, which is a disaccharide. Galactose is not a disease, but it can be a cause of health issues when it accumulates in the body due to a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, resulting in a condition called Galactosemia. Therefore, it can be considered a significant entity in relation to certain diseases."},
