Acute renal insufficiency: This is a condition where the kidneys suddenly lose their ability to filter blood effectively, leading to a buildup of waste products and fluid in the body.\n2.

Primary systemic amyloidosis is a type of amyloidosis that affects multiple organs, including the kidneys.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Acute renal insufficiency\n2.
