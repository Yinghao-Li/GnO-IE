Apoptosis is a programmed cell death, which is a natural process that helps remove damaged or unwanted cells.\n2. DOX treatment: Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anticancer drug that can cause damage to the heart muscle, leading to cardiotoxicity.\n3. Cardiac function: This refers to the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively. A decrease in cardiac function can indicate various heart diseases or conditions.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to diseases in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis\n2. Cardiotoxicity (implied by DOX treatment)"},
