Transient prolongation of the QT interval: This is a condition where the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement is prolonged for a short period of time. The QT interval represents the time it takes for the heart to recover after each heartbeat. Prolongation of the QT interval can increase the risk of developing a potentially life-threatening heart rhythm disorder called Torsades de Pointes (TdP).\n2. Torsades de Pointes (TdP): This is a type of life-threatening heart rhythm disorder characterized by a twisting or \"torsion\" of the electrical activity in the heart, leading to a potentially fatal arrhythmia. It is often associated with a prolonged QT interval on an ECG.\n\nSo, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are \"Transient prolongation of the QT interval\" and \"Torsades de Pointes (TdP)\"."},
