    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Isoprenaline: This is a specific type of sympathomimetic amine and a bronchodilator, which acts as a beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It is used to treat bronchospasms and cardiac conditions such as heart failure and bradycardia. In this context, it is referred to as a drug that causes positive inotropic and chronotropic responses.\n\n2. ( + ) - Propranolol: This is a non-selective beta-blocker, which means it blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. It is used to treat various conditions such as hypertension, angina pectoris, heart failure, and arrhythmias. In this context, it is mentioned as having less than one hundredth the potency compared to ( - ) - propranolol in blocking the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoprenaline.\n\n3. ( - ) - Propranolol: This is also a non-selective beta-blocker, similar to ( + ) - propranolol. However, it is the enantiomer with the opposite configuration at the chiral carbon atom. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, and they can have different biological activities. In this context, it is mentioned as having a greater potency than ( + ) - propranolol in blocking the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoprenaline.\n\nTherefore, the disease entities are not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. However, the paragraph discusses the effects of certain drugs on the heart, specifically their ability to block the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoprenaline. These responses are related to heart function and can be indicative of conditions such as heart failure or arrhythmias."},
