Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats. High diastolic blood pressure is a risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension (high blood pressure).\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are:\n\n1. Hypertension (High blood pressure) - This is the underlying condition for which the dosage of medication is being adjusted. Hypertension is a chronic disease characterized by persistently high blood pressure in the arteries. It is a major risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack, stroke, and kidney damage."},
