In this context, it seems to be used to describe a side effect or complication of a medical procedure. However, without further context, it's difficult to determine if it refers to a specific disease or condition.\n2. Respiratory upset: This term is often used to describe discomfort or distress related to the respiratory system. It can be a symptom of various respiratory conditions or diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or emphysema. In this context, it's clear that some patients experienced respiratory distress severe enough to require abandoning the procedure. Therefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are likely to be the conditions or diseases causing the respiratory upset in these patients. Without further information, it's impossible to determine exactly which diseases are being referred to."},
