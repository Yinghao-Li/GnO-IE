While not technically a disease, it is a medical condition that requires special consideration during pregnancy due to potential risks to both the mother and fetus.\n2. Risks to mother: This refers to potential health complications that the mother may experience as a result of having a prosthetic cardiac valve during pregnancy. These risks could include infection, valve dysfunction, or other cardiovascular issues.\n3. Risks to fetus: This refers to potential health complications that the fetus may experience as a result of the mother having a prosthetic cardiac valve during pregnancy. These risks could include preterm labor, low birth weight, or developmental issues.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph that relate to diseases or health conditions are \"risks to mother\" and \"risks to fetus,\" which are both related to the presence of a prosthetic cardiac valve."},
