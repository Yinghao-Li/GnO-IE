Blood-brain barrier: The blood-brain barrier is not a disease per se, but rather a structure that separates the brain from the bloodstream and regulates the exchange of substances between them. However, damage to the blood-brain barrier can lead to various neurological conditions, such as edema, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nTherefore, in this context, the focus is on evaluating the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, which could indicate damage or dysfunction.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph could be:\n\n1. Damage or dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier."},

It is mainly composed of water, proteins, electrolytes, and various cells like red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n2. Brain: It is a complex organ that controls various functions of the body, including thought, memory, emotion, and motor skills. It is mainly composed of water, lipids, and various proteins and nucleic acids.\n3. Evans Blue dye: It is a trypan blue dye that is commonly used to study the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. It binds to albumin in the blood and is not able to cross the intact blood-brain barrier. However, when the barrier is damaged, Evans Blue dye can extravasate into the brain tissue, making it visible for imaging or histological analysis.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"Evans Blue dye\" and \"blood\" (specifically, the protein component of blood, such as albumin, that interacts with Evans Blue dye)."},
