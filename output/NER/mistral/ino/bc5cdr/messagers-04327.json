They can cause damage to cells and tissues through oxidation reactions.\n2. Gentamicin: This is an antibiotic aminoglycoside, commonly used to treat various bacterial infections. It can cause nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) through oxidative stress and free radical formation.\n3. Protective effects: These are the beneficial actions of certain substances that help prevent or reduce damage to cells and tissues.\n4. Free radical scavengers: These are substances that can neutralize free radicals by donating an electron to them, thereby stabilizing the free radical and preventing further damage.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are free radicals, gentamicin, and free radical scavengers."},
