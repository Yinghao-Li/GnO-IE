    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Stable angina: This is a type of chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle is not getting enough oxygen-rich blood. It is considered \"stable\" if it follows a predictable pattern and is typically brought on by physical activity or emotional stress.\n2. Coronary artery disease: This is a condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of plaque. This can lead to chest pain or angina, heart attacks, and other complications.\n3. Normal left ventricular function: This refers to the proper functioning of the left ventricle, the main pumping chamber of the heart. A normal left ventricular function means that the heart is pumping blood efficiently and effectively.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are coronary artery disease and stable angina."},
