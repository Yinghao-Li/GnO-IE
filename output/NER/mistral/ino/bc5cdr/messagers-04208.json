Parkinson's disease: It is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability.\n\n2. Motor disability: This refers to the physical impairments and functional limitations caused by Parkinson's disease.\n\n3. Dyskinesias: These are involuntary movements that can occur as a side effect of long-term levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease patients.\n\n4. Levodopa: It is a medication used to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease by increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain.\n\n5. Apomorphine: It is a dopamine agonist used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, particularly motor fluctuations and dyskinesias.\n\n6. Fluoxetine: It is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant medication. It was administered to the patients in the study, but it is not directly related to Parkinson's disease or its motor symptoms."},
