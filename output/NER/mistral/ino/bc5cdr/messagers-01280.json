It is putatively responsible for renal damage through the production of its metabolite, chloroacetaldehyde.\n\n3.

It is identified as a metabolite, which means it is a byproduct formed during a metabolic process. The chemical structure of CAA is a chloroaldehyde, which is a type of chemical compound.\n\n2. Ifosfamide (IFO): This is another specific chemical compound mentioned in the paragraph. It is identified as an alkylating agent, which is a type of chemotherapeutic drug. Alkylating agents work by adding an alkyl group to DNA, damaging it and inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) and Ifosfamide (IFO)."},
