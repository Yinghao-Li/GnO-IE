    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. cTnI: This is a cardiac biomarker, specifically a type of cardiac troponin. Cardiac troponins are complex proteins that play a crucial role in the regulation of muscle contraction in the heart. When the heart muscle is damaged, such as during a myocardial infarction (MI), troponins are released into the bloodstream. cTnI is one of the isoforms of cardiac troponin.\n\n2. CK - MB: Creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) is another cardiac biomarker. Creatine kinase is an enzyme found in various tissues, including the heart and skeletal muscles. The MB isoform of creatine kinase is specific to the heart. When heart muscle is damaged, CK-MB is released into the bloodstream.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are cTnI and CK-MB, which are cardiac biomarkers."},
