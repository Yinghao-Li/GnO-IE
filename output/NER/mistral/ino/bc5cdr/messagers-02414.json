Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) and a second-generation thalidomide analog. It is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and other hematological malignancies.\n\n2. Dexamethasone: It is another specific chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid, a type of steroid hormone. It is commonly used in the treatment of various inflammatory conditions, including multiple myeloma, due to its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties.\n\n3. Multiple myeloma: Although not a chemical entity itself, multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that involves the production of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow. The treatment of multiple myeloma often involves the use of various chemical entities, such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone, as mentioned in the paragraph."},
