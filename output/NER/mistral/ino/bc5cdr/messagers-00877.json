Hemoglobin: Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. It is not a chemical in the traditional sense, but it is a biomolecule and an essential component of red blood cells.\n2. Patients with anemia: Anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. It is not a chemical, but a medical condition.\n3. 2 g: This is a mass measurement, specifically grams. It is not a chemical entity, but a physical quantity.\n4. dL: dL stands for deciliter, which is a unit of volume.
