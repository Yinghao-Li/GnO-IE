Antipsychotic treatment\n\nAntipsychotic treatment is not a disease itself, but rather a treatment for various mental health conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other psychoses. The paragraph suggests that antipsychotic treatment may lead to synaptic changes, and NO (nitric oxide) may play a role in these changes. Therefore, the focus is on the potential effects of antipsychotic treatment on the nervous system, rather than the diseases themselves."},
