Retrospective: This term refers to a type of research study where data is collected and analyzed from previously collected records or documents, rather than collecting new data specifically for the study. It is not a chemical entity.\n2. Case-controlled analysis: This is a type of study design where the researchers identify people with a particular disease or condition (cases) and compare them with a similar group of people without the disease or condition (controls), to identify risk factors for the disease. It is also not a chemical entity.\n3. Patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit: These are people who have been hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) for severe exacerbations of asthma. Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, making it difficult to breathe. It is not a chemical entity.\n4. Severe exacerbations of asthma: This refers to a worsening of asthma symptoms, which can include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. It is not a chemical entity.\n5. Who received continuously nebulized albuterol (CNA): These are patients who received albuterol treatment through a nebulizer continuously. Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist bronchodilator medication used to relieve symptoms of bronchospasm and make breathing easier. It is a chemical entity.\n6. Intermittent albuterol (INA): These are patients who received albuterol treatment intermittently, likely through an inhaler or nebulizer on an as-needed basis. Albuterol is the same chemical entity as in CNA, but the administration method is different."},
