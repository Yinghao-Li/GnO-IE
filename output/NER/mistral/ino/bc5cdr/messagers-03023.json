The paragraph mentions \"complete patency of the SVC,\" which means the vein is not obstructed by a clot or other blockage.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are thrombosis, and possibly related conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (not explicitly mentioned but implied due to the context of the paragraph)."},
