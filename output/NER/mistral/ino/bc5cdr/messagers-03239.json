The paragraph only mentions that 54.5% of patients were on immunomodulatory agents at baseline. Immunomodulatory agents are drugs that modify the body's immune response. They are used to treat various diseases, including autoimmune disorders, cancer, and infectious diseases. However, the paragraph itself does not provide enough information to definitively identify the specific diseases or conditions that these patients may have. Therefore, no disease entities can be identified from this paragraph alone."},
