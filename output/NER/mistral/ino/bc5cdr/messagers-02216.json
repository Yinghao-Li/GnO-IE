It is considered a disease condition when it occurs inappropriately, such as in various fibrotic and vascular diseases.\n\n2. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs): AGEs are not a disease per se, but they are a group of compounds that can contribute to various diseases, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, through their toxic effects on cells and tissues.\n\n3. Diabetes: While not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, diabetes is an underlying condition that can lead to the production and accumulation of AGEs. It is a chronic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood.\n\n4. Atherosclerosis: Atherosclerosis is a disease characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arterial walls, which can lead to various cardiovascular complications, such as heart attacks and strokes. AGEs have been implicated in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.\n\n5. Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of cognitive abilities. AGEs have been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease."},
