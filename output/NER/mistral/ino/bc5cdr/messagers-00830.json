In this context, \"hepatic\" refers to the liver.\n2. Fatty acid oxidation: This is a metabolic process that breaks down fatty acids to produce energy. The term \"fatty acid\" refers to a type of lipid.\n3. Lipoprotein assembly: Lipoproteins are complexes of lipids and proteins that transport lipids in the bloodstream. The term \"lipoprotein\" refers to these complexes.\n4. Lipid transport: Lipids are transported in the body through various mechanisms, including the transport of lipoproteins in the bloodstream. The term \"lipid\" refers to a broad category of organic compounds that include fats, oils, and waxes.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are: RNA, fatty acids, lipoproteins, and lipids."},
