It refers to the difficulty or inability to accurately recognize fear in others.\n2. Subacute effects of cocaine: Cocaine is a drug, and its subacute effects can refer to the short-term or intermediate-term health consequences of using the drug. Cocaine use can lead to various health problems, including impairments in cognitive function, memory, and emotional processing.\n3. Ecstasy: Ecstasy is also a drug, and its use can have various health effects, including impairments in cognitive function, memory, and emotional processing.\n4. Recent and less recent users of these drugs: This refers to individuals who have used cocaine or ecstasy at different points in time. While not diseases, their drug use can be a risk factor for various health conditions, including the selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy mentioned in the paragraph."},
