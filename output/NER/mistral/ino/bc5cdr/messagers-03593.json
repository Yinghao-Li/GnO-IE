Its molecular formula is C18H19ClN3O3.\n\n2. 1 - 10 mg / kg: This is a dosage expression, indicating that the dose of Indomethacin is between 1 mg and 10 mg per kilogram of body weight.\n\n3. Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen is also a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Its molecular formula is C13H18O2.\n\n4. 10 - 100 mg / kg: This is a dosage expression, indicating that the dose of Ibuprofen is between 10 mg and 100 mg per kilogram of body weight.\n\n5. Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is a cholinergic alkaloid. Its molecular formula is C17H21NO3.\n\n6. Seizures: Seizures are not a chemical entity, but rather a medical condition characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. However, the paragraph mentions that Indomethacin and Ibuprofen failed to modulate seizures produced by Pilocarpine, so these drugs are the relevant chemical entities in this context."},
