Morphine: This is a drug that can induce a place preference in the counterbalanced method when attenuated by quinine. Morphine is an opioid medication used to relieve pain. It can also be addictive and lead to substance use disorders.\n3. 4-aminopyridine: This is a compound or substance that was ineffective in inducing place preference in the counterbalanced method. It is an FDA-approved drug used to treat certain neurological conditions, such as spinal cord injuries and multiple sclerosis. However, it can also cause side effects like seizures, muscle cramps, and increased heart rate.\n\nTherefore, the only disease-related entity in the paragraph is Morphine addiction or substance use disorder."},
