It is commonly used as a medication to prevent and treat blood clots.\n\n2. HITT: HITT stands for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis. It is a rare but serious complication of heparin therapy, characterized by a decrease in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and the formation of blood clots (thrombosis).\n\n3. Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by weakened bones, making them more susceptible to fractures. It is not directly related to heparin, but it is mentioned as a common side effect of heparin use, particularly in long-term therapy."},
