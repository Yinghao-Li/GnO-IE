However, it is mentioned in relation to side effects, so it can be considered a context for the discussion of diseases.\n2. High serum tricyclic antidepressant concentrations: This is not a disease, but rather a condition or state. However, it can be a risk factor or symptom for certain diseases or side effects.\n3. Side effects: This is a broad term that can refer to various adverse health conditions or symptoms. In this context, it is likely referring to the adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants on the central nervous system. Some possible specific diseases or conditions that could be included under this umbreterm might be:\n   - Tardive dyskinesia\n   - Seizures\n   - Delirium\n   - Toxicity (acute or chronic)\n   - Serotonin syndrome\n   - Anticholinergic delirium\n   - Other CNS side effects (such as dizziness, headache, agitation, etc.)\n\nTherefore, the main disease entities in the paragraph are likely the various central nervous system side effects that can result from high serum tricyclic antidepressant concentrations."},
