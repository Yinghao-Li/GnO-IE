Severe polyneuropathy: This is a type of neuropathy, which is a disease condition characterized by damage to multiple peripheral nerves, leading to motor and sensory symptoms.\n2. Motor loss: This refers to the loss of motor function, which is a symptom of various neurological conditions, including polyneuropathy.\n3. Intrathecal thiotepa combination chemotherapy: Thiotepa is a type of chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of various cancers. When administered intrathecally, it can cause side effects, including severe polyneuropathy and motor loss. Therefore, intrathecal thiotepa combination chemotherapy is not a disease but a treatment that can lead to the development of these conditions."},
