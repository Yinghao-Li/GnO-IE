STN: The STN stands for Sub-Thalamic Nucleus, which is a part of the basal ganglia in the brain. It's not a chemical entity, but it can be considered a biological entity.\n3. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS): This is a standardized assessment tool used to evaluate the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. It's not a chemical entity.\n4. Parts II and III: These refer to specific sections of the UPDRS. They are not chemical entities.\n5. Scores: These are numerical values representing the severity of symptoms in the activities of daily living and motor examination. They are not chemical entities.\n6. Activities of daily living: These are functional tasks that individuals perform as part of their daily lives. They are not chemical entities.\n7. Motor examination: This refers to the assessment of motor symptoms, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. It is not a chemical entity.\n8. Off medication: This refers to the assessment of symptoms without the use of medication. It is not a chemical entity.\n9. Percentage improvement (62% and 61%): These are numerical values representing the degree of improvement in symptoms. They are not chemical entities.\n10. P: This stands for \"p-value,\" which is a statistical measure used to determine the significance of a result.
