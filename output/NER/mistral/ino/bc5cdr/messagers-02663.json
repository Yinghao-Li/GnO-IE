Necrosis: Necrosis is a type of localized injury to body tissues resulting in tissue death due to ischemia (lack of blood supply), toxins, infections, or other causes.\n2. TAP: TAP (Tumor Associated Proteins) are proteins that are produced in response to the presence of a tumor. They can be used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.\n3. DNA SBs: DNA Single-Strand Breaks (SSBs) are breaks in the single strand of DNA. They can be caused by various factors, including ionizing radiation, chemicals, and enzymes. SSBs can lead to mutations and cell death if not repaired properly."},

However, it can be influenced by various chemicals, so it's important to keep it in mind as a potential response to chemical exposure.\n2. Necrosis: Necrosis is a type of cell death. It can be caused by various chemicals, including toxins, heavy metals, and oxidative agents.\n3. TAP: TAP (Taurine Transporter) is a protein that plays a role in the transport of the amino acid taurine across cell membranes. It's not a chemical entity itself, but it can be affected by chemicals that interact with it.\n4. DNA SBs: DNA SBs (Single-Strand Breaks) are damage to the DNA molecule. They can be caused by various chemicals, including ionizing radiation and certain chemicals that can form reactive oxygen species."},
