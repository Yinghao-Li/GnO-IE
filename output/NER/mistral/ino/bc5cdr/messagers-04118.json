While it's not a chemical entity itself, it's important to note that blood is primarily composed of water, electrolytes, and various proteins and nutrients. Therefore, identifying \"bleeding\" as a chemical entity is not entirely accurate, but it's related to the chemical processes occurring in the body.\n\nSo, in this context, there are no specific chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph. However, if we were to consider the broader context of a surgical setting, various chemicals such as anesthetics, antiseptics, and medications used during surgery could be relevant."},
