It acts as a bronchodilator by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways, making it easier to breathe. Fenoterol-hydrobromide is not a disease, but rather a medication used to treat certain conditions.\n\n2. Ritodrin-HCl: Similar to fenoterol-hydrobromide, ritodrin-HCl is also a medication used for the treatment of asthma and other obstructive airway diseases. It acts as a bronchodilator by stimulating the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands. Ritodrin-HCl is not a disease.\n\n3. Tremor: Tremor is a neurological condition characterized by involuntary and rhythmic muscle contractions and relaxations, resulting in shaking movements. It can affect various parts of the body and can be caused by various underlying conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or drug side effects.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"tremor.\""},
