Consumption of MSG in large amounts can lead to various symptoms collectively known as MSG symptom complex. The symptoms include headache, flushing, sweating, facial pressure or tightness, numbness, tingling or burning in the face, neck and other areas, rapid, fluttering heartbeats (heart palpitations), chest pain, nausea, and weakness. In severe cases, it may cause seizures.\n\nTherefore, MSG can be considered a Disease or Condition causing agent in this context."},
