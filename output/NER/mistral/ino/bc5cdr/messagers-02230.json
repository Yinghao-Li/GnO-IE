It is not considered a disease, but rather a pharmacological effect.\n2. Tumor: Implied, but not explicitly stated in the paragraph.\n3. Angiogenic effect: This is the process of forming new blood vessels. It is not a disease, but rather a biological process that can contribute to the growth and spread of tumors.\n4. Decrease of tumor microvessel density: This refers to a decrease in the number of blood vessels within a tumor. It can be a sign of a therapeutic response to antiangiogenic treatment, but it is not a disease itself.\n5. VEGF expression: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a protein that plays a key role in angiogenesis. An increase in VEGF expression is often associated with the growth and spread of tumors. Therefore, a decrease in VEGF expression can be a desirable therapeutic effect."},
