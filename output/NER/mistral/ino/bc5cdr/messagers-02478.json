It is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment.\n3. Cognitive deficits: This refers to the impairment or loss of cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. It is a symptom of various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease."},
