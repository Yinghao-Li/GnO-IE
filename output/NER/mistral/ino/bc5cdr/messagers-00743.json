    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Digoxin: Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside medication that is commonly used to treat heart conditions such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It is extracted from the foxglove plant and has the chemical structure of a steroid with a lactone ring. Its molecular formula is C37H52O11NS. Digoxin works by increasing the force and efficiency of heart contractions while slowing heart rate. It is important to note that digoxin toxicity can occur if the dosage is too high, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, and irregular heart rhythms. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using digoxin, especially before large mortality trials have been completed to determine its overall benefits or harms."},
