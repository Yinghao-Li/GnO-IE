It is not a disease itself, but rather an effect of a drug on diseases (tumors).\n\n2. Cardiotoxicity: This is a side effect or adverse reaction of doxorubicin, which can cause damage to the heart muscle and lead to heart failure.\n\n3. Nephrotoxicity: This is another side effect or adverse reaction of doxorubicin, which can cause damage to the kidneys.\n\n4. IgM solid immunocytoma: This is a type of tumor or disease that is characterized by the presence of IgM (Immunoglobulin M) proteins and solid growth. It is not explicitly stated in the paragraph whether it is a malignant or benign tumor, but it is mentioned as being present in the rat used in the study."},
