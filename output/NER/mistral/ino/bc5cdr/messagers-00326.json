It does not contain any chemical entities in the given term.\n2. h-SOD1: This stands for human superoxide dismutase 1, which is a specific type of enzyme called superoxide dismutase. Superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant enzyme that helps protect cells from oxidative damage.\n3. C57BL / 6: This is a strain of laboratory mice commonly used in biomedical research. It is not a chemical entity.\n4. TgN [SOD1] 3Cje: This is a genetically modified strain of C57BL/6 mice that carries the human SOD1 gene under the control of the neuron-specific enchancer and promoter (NSEP) element. The \"Tg\" stands for transgenic, indicating that the mice have been genetically modified to express the human SOD1 protein.
