The paragraph is describing a medical procedure where serum creatinine was measured 48 hours post-procedure for both groups. Creatinine is a waste product found in the blood, and an elevated level of creatinine in the blood can indicate kidney damage or dysfunction. However, the paragraph itself does not provide enough information to definitively identify any diseases. Therefore, based on the given paragraph, no diseases have been identified."},
