PAN nephropathy: This is a type of kidney disease, and it's not a chemical entity, but rather a pathological condition.\n2. rhIGF-I: This stands for recombinant human Insulin-like Growth Factor-1. It is a recombinant form of the human IGF-1 protein.\n3. IGF-I: Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 is a peptide hormone that plays a role in growth promotion and metabolism regulation.\n4. GH receptor: Growth Hormone Receptor is a protein that binds to Growth Hormone (GH) and initiates a signaling cascade.\n5. IGF-I receptor mRNA: messenger RNA (mRNA) for Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 receptor. It is the template for the production of the IGF-1 receptor protein.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are: rhIGF-I (recombinant human Insulin-like Growth Factor-1), IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1), and the protein product of the IGF-I receptor mRNA."},
