It refers to a type of clinical trial where data from different groups are not directly compared.\n5. clinical trial : This term is not a chemical entity, but rather a research study that tests how well new medical treatments or interventions work in people. It involves recruiting volunteers to participate and following them closely to monitor their health and response to the treatment.\n\nTherefore, there are no chemical entities identified in the given paragraph."},
