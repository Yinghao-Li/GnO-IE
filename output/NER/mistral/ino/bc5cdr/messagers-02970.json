    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Opioid: Opioids are a class of chemicals that include natural and synthetic substances that bind to opioid receptors in the body to reduce pain.\n2. Hyperalgesia: Hyperalgesia is a condition characterized by an increased sensitivity to pain. It is not a chemical itself, but a condition or response to certain stimuli.\n3. Nociceptive: Nociceptors are sensory neurons that detect potentially harmful stimuli, such as heat, cold, or mechanical pressure.\n4. Sensitization: Sensitization is a state in which the response to a stimulus is enhanced. In the context of OIH, it refers to an increased sensitivity to pain after the cessation of chronic opioid use.\n5. Cessation: Cessation refers to the act of stopping the use of a substance, in this case, opioids.\n6. Chronic opioid use: Chronic opioid use refers to the long-term use of opioids, which can lead to physical dependence and other adverse effects, including hyperalgesia."},
