Tetracyclines are a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics that inhibit the growth of bacteria by binding to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome.\n\n2. Oleic acid: It is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid that is a major component of many animal and vegetable fats. It is an essential fatty acid, meaning it cannot be produced by the body and must be obtained through diet. Oleic acid is a key component of olive oil and is also found in other foods such as nuts, avocados, and animal fats. It is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and is believed to help reduce bad cholesterol levels in the blood."},
