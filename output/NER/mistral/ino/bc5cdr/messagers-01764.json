So, it can be considered as a treatment for diseases related to heart conditions, such as hypertension, angina pectoris, heart failure, etc.\n2. ( - ) - propranolol and ( + ) - propranolol: These are enantiomers of propranolol. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other, and they may have different pharmacological effects. In this context, they are being compared in terms of their dosage for producing beta-blockade. Since beta-blockade is a therapeutic effect used to treat various heart conditions, the comparison of these enantiomers can be considered related to diseases related to heart conditions.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to diseases in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Heart conditions (hypertension, angina pectoris, heart failure, etc.)\n2. Beta-blockade (a therapeutic effect used to treat various heart conditions)"},
