Heroin dependency: This is a state of addiction to heroin, characterized by compulsive drug-seeking behavior despite negative consequences.\n4. Methadone maintenance therapy: This is a treatment for opioid addiction, which involves the regular administration of methadone to help manage withdrawal symptoms and reduce the use of illicit opioids."},
