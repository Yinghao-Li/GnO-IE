It is not a disease itself, but rather a diagnostic test.\n\n2. Delayed reactions: This refers to a type of allergic reaction where symptoms appear after a delay of several hours or days following exposure to an allergen. It is not a specific disease, but rather a characteristic of certain allergic reactions.\n\n3. PRC: This likely refers to Polyrene Compounds, which are a group of chemicals used in various industries, including pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Exposure to certain PRCs can cause allergic contact dermatitis, a type of skin disease characterized by inflammation and rash.\n\n4. Common chains: This likely refers to common structural features shared by certain PRCs that can cause allergic reactions. It is not a disease, but rather a characteristic of certain chemicals.\n\n5. Structures: This likely refers to the molecular structures of the PRCs. It is not a disease, but rather a characteristic of the chemicals."},
