It is also used off-label for the treatment of various conditions such as hiccups, motion sickness, and Parkinson's disease.\n2. Mianserin: It is an atypical antipsychotic and antihistamine medication used to treat various conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety. It is also used off-label for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.\n3. Chlorpheniramine: It is an antihistamine medication used to relieve symptoms of allergies, including sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and runny nose.\n4. BSA: It is an abbreviation for bovine serum albumin, a protein found in bovine (cow) serum. It is commonly used as an antigen in immunological tests and as a protein source in various applications.\n5. Animals: The animals in this context are not explicitly identified as having a specific disease, but the paragraph mentions that they received some sort of treatment to prevent deaths after receiving BSA on day + 7. It is possible that the animals were suffering from an allergic reaction or other immune response to BSA.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Allergic reaction or immune response to BSA."},
