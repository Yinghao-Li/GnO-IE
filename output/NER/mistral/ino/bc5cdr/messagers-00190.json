It is the enlargement of the pupil, which allows more light to enter the eye. However, it can cause side effects such as blurred vision and difficulty focusing on near objects, which could potentially impact driving performance. Therefore, it is important to consider pupil dilation as a condition or effect caused by the use of tropicamide, rather than a disease."},
