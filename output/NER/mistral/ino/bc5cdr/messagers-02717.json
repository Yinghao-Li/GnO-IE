Neuronal cell death.\n\nExplanation:\nSTZ is a known chemical used to induce diabetes in animals for research purposes. In this context, it is causing memory impairment, which is a disease or symptom. The key factors contributing to this memory impairment are identified as glial activation and post synaptic neurotoxicity. Glial activation refers to the activation of glial cells in response to injury or disease, while post synaptic neurotoxicity is a type of damage to the post synaptic neurons, leading to impaired neuronal function. Both glial activation and post synaptic neurotoxicity are diseases or conditions associated with neuronal damage."},

It is an antibiotic and an alkylating agent that selectively destroys pancreatic beta cells.\n\n2. Glial cells: Glial cells are non-neuronal cells that support and protect neurons in the central nervous system. They play various roles in maintaining the health of the nervous system, including providing structural support, insulating neurons, and providing nutrients.\n\n3. Post synaptic neurotoxicity: It refers to the damage or dysfunction of the post-synaptic neuron, which can lead to impaired neural transmission and ultimately neuronal cell death. It can be caused by various chemicals, including neurotoxins and excitotoxins.\n\nTherefore, the key chemical entities in the paragraph are STZ (Streptozotocin) and post synaptic neurotoxicity."},
