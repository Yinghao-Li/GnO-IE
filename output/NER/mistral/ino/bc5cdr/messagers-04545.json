It does not directly cause a disease but is a hormone involved in various physiological processes.\n\n2. TRH (Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone): It is a hormone produced in the hypothalamus that stimulates the pituitary gland to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin. It does not directly cause a disease but is a hormone involved in various physiological processes.\n\n3. CO2 threshold: It is not a disease but a term used to describe a certain level of carbon dioxide in the body or environment that triggers a response. In this context, it refers to the point at which hCRH and TRH cause a reduction in the CO2 threshold, meaning that less CO2 is required to elicit a response. This information alone does not provide enough context to determine if this reduction is beneficial or harmful, so it cannot be classified as a disease."},
