It can cause brain damage when used in high doses or for prolonged periods.\n2. Pyramidal cells: These are neurons (nerve cells) located in the hippocampus region of the brain. Damage to these cells can result in various neurological conditions, including epilepsy, memory loss, and motor impairment.\n\nIn this context, the \"brain damage by pilocarpine\" refers to the harmful effects caused by the use of pilocarpine on the brain, specifically the pyramidal cells in the hippocampus."},

Scopolamine: It is a tropane alkaloid, which acts as a muscarinic antagonist. It is used as an anticholinergic drug for various purposes such as treatment of motion sickness, Parkinson's disease, and as a preanesthetic medication.\n3. Pilocarpine: It is a cholinergic alkaloid, which acts as a parasympathomimetic drug. It is used to treat glaucoma and to reverse the symptoms of anticholinergic poisoning.\n4. MK-801: It is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. It is used as an anesthetic and as a research tool in neuroscience.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are Pentobarbital, Scopolamine, Pilocarpine, and MK-801."},
