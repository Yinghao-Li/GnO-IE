    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Torsades de pointes: This is a specific type of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia (disease) characterized by a twisting or \"twisting of the points\" of the QRS complex in the electrocardiogram (ECG) trace.\n\n2. Cycle length: Refers to the time interval between two consecutive heartbeats, which is a measure of the heart's rhythm. Longer cycle lengths can increase the risk of certain heart rhythm disorders, including torsades de pointes.\n\n3. QT interval: A segment of the ECG trace representing the time it takes for the ventricles to depolarize and repolarize. Prolonged QT intervals can increase the risk of developing torsades de pointes.\n\n4. QTc interval: The corrected QT interval, which is the QT interval adjusted for heart rate. It is used to assess the risk of developing torsades de pointes, as some medications can prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of this arrhythmia.\n\n5. Oral d, l-sotalol: A medication used to treat heart rhythm disorders and high blood pressure. It can cause changes in the ECG, including prolongation of the QT interval, which may increase the risk of torsades de pointes."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Pronounced changes: This term does not directly refer to a specific chemical entity. It refers to noticeable alterations or differences in the surface ECG (Electrocardiogram).\n\n2. cycle length: This term refers to the time interval between two consecutive R waves in an ECG trace. It is a measure of the duration of the heart's electrical cycle.\n\n3. QT: QT interval is a measure of the duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization on an ECG. It represents the time from the beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave.\n\n4. QTc: QTc interval is the corrected QT interval, which is the QT interval adjusted for heart rate. It is calculated by applying the Bazett formula or other methods to account for the effect of heart rate on QT interval measurement.\n\n5. oral d, l - sotalol: Sotalol is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and a selective beta-blocker. It is available as a racemic mixture of the d- and l-enantiomers. The chemical structure of sotalol includes a sulfonamide moiety and a quinidine-like side chain.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are d, l - sotalol and its sulfonamide moiety."},
