Hepatic mRNA levels: This refers to the messenger RNA (mRNA) present in the liver. mRNA is not a disease, but rather a molecular component involved in the process of protein synthesis.\n2. CYP7A: CYP7A is a specific isoform of the cytochrome P450 enzyme family. It is involved in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver. Reduction in its mRNA levels is not a disease per se, but it could be a sign of certain liver conditions or responses to certain medications.\n3. EE: EE stands for ezetimibe, a medication used to lower cholesterol levels by reducing the absorption of cholesterol from the gut.
