Contralateral motor control refers to the coordinated movement of muscles on opposite sides of the body, which is controlled by the opposite hemispheres of the brain. For example, the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body, and the right hemisphere controls the left side. This concept is important in determining the dominant cerebral hemisphere, which can be relevant in various neurological conditions, such as stroke or brain injury."},

They control different functions, and damage to one hemisphere can result in various neurological deficits. The term \"hemisphere\" is not a chemical entity but rather a structural one.\n3.

They are not chemical entities but rather living organisms that can be studied for various scientific purposes, including neurological research.\n\nTherefore, there are no chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
