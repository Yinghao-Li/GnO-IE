It is not a disease itself, but rather a condition or characteristic.\n2. Basal prolactin levels (PRL): Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. Basal levels refer to the normal or resting levels of this hormone in the body. Prolactin levels can be elevated in certain conditions such as hyperprolactinemia or prolactinoma, which are diseases. Therefore, the basal prolactin levels mentioned in the paragraph could potentially be associated with these diseases. However, without further context, it is impossible to definitively say that the individuals in question have these diseases."},
