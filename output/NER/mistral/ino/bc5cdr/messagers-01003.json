Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, which is a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).\n\n2. Acetaminophen (paracetamol): It is also a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. Acetaminophen is a common over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer.\n\n3. Nimesulide: It is another chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. Nimesulide is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for the treatment of pain and inflammation.\n\n4. Common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): This is a category of chemical entities, which includes various drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac, among others. They are used for the treatment of pain and inflammation.\n\n5. COX-2 inhibitor: It is a class of chemical entities, which includes celecoxib and other drugs that selectively inhibit the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. COX-2 inhibitors are a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)."},
