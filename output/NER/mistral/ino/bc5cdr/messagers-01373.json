Autosomal recessive disorder: This is a type of inheritance pattern for Wilson's disease. It is not the disease itself, but a characteristic feature of how Wilson's disease is passed down in families.\n3. Hepatic copper metabolism: This refers to the process by which the body processes and regulates copper in the liver. It is not a disease, but a metabolic process that is affected in Wilson's disease.\n4. Copper accumulation and toxicity: This is a consequence or complication of Wilson's disease, specifically the buildup of copper in various tissues leading to toxicity.\n5. Hepatic disorders: This refers to conditions or diseases affecting the liver, which can be a result of Wilson's disease.\n6. Neurologic disorders: This refers to conditions or diseases affecting the nervous system, which can be a result of Wilson's disease.\n7. Psychiatric disorders: This refers to mental or behavioral conditions, which can be a result of Wilson's disease."},
