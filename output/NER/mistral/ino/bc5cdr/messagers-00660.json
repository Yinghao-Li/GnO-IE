The specific chemicals used for anesthesia can vary, but common anesthetics include propofol, fentanyl, and sevoflurane.\n3. Forced duction testing: Forced duction testing is a diagnostic procedure used to assess the integrity of the extraocular muscles and the orbital structures.

Ocular motility: Ocular motility refers to the ability of the eyes to move in various directions. It is not a chemical entity.\n6.
