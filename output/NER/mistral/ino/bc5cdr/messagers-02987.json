While it is primarily used to manage pain, anxiety, and agitation in intensive care unit patients, it is not considered a disease itself. However, its prolonged use can lead to side effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, and rebound hypertension upon discontinuation.\n\n2. Propofol: It is a short-acting intravenous anesthetic and sedative agent. Like dexmedetomidine, it is not a disease but can cause side effects such as respiratory depression, apnea, and pain at the injection site when administered continuously.\n\nTherefore, neither dexmedetomidine nor propofol are diseases, but they are interventions used for managing various medical conditions."},
