Acute hepatitis refers to an inflammation of the liver that occurs suddenly and lasts for a short period of time. Symptoms may include jaundice, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes.\n\n2. Clopidogrel: While not a disease, clopidogrel is a drug that has been associated with acute hepatitis in some cases. It is a platelet aggregation inhibitor commonly used to prevent heart attacks and strokes. However, it can cause liver damage in some individuals, leading to acute hepatitis."},

It is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system, specifically the CYP2C19 enzyme. Its major metabolite is an active metabolite called 2-oxo-clopidogrel, which is responsible for its antiplatelet effects.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
