Ecstasy: Ecstasy is a psychoactive drug, also known as MDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which is a common recreational drug that can have negative health effects, including those on the nervous system and cardiovascular system.

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Ecstasy: Ecstasy is a psychoactive drug, chemically known as MDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine). It acts as a hormone releaser, increasing the levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain.\n\n2. Polydrug use: Polydrug use refers to the use of multiple psychoactive substances at the same time or in combination. The specific chemicals involved depend on the drugs being used.\n\n3. Cortisol: Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands in response to stress. It plays a crucial role in the body's stress response, regulating metabolism, immune response, and blood sugar levels.\n\n4. HPA axis: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a major endocrine system that controls the response to stress. It consists of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands, which work together to release hormones like cortisol in response to stressors."},
