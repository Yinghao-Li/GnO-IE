HIV infection: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that weakens the immune system and leads to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\n2. Ureteric stones: Ureteric stones are small, hard deposits that form in the ureter, a tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder.\n3. Obstruction: Obstruction refers to the blockage of a body passage or duct, in this context, it is likely referring to the blockage of the ureter due to stones."},

However, since the paragraph does not provide any additional information about other potential causes of obstruction, it is not necessary to keep it as a separate disease entity."},

In this context, it is mentioned that images may need to be obtained using \"i.v. contrast material,\" which refers to a solution of iodine that is injected into a vein (intravenously) to enhance the visibility of structures within the body during imaging.\n2. ureteric stones: Ureteric stones are small, hard deposits that form in the ureters, which are the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Ureteric stones can cause pain, obstruction, and other complications.\n3. HIV infection: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that attacks the body's immune system, leading to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) if left untreated.\n4. indinavir: Indinavir is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection. It is a protease inhibitor that works by blocking the action of the HIV protease enzyme, preventing the virus from replicating.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are iodine, ureteric stones, HIV infection, and indinavir."},
