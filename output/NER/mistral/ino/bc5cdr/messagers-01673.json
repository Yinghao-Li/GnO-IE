CD4: CD4 is a protein, specifically a glycoprotein, found on the surface of T-helper cells in the immune system. It is an essential component of the T-cell receptor complex and plays a crucial role in the immune response.\n3. Cells: Cells are not chemical entities per se, but they are biological entities made up of various chemical components. In this context, the cells referred to are white blood cells, specifically CD4+ T-cells.\n4. MicroL: Micro liter (ÂµL) is a unit of volume measurement in the metric system. It is equivalent to one millionth of a liter.\n5. Percentage: Percentage is a mathematical representation of a fraction of a whole. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are CD4 protein and the cells (specifically CD4+ T-cells)."},
