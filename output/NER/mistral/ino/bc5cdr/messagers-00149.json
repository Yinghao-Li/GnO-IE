However, the context suggests that \"exquisite control\" implies potential complications or issues related to renal function, which could be related to certain kidney diseases or conditions.\n2. Increase in water ingestion: This is not a disease, but a treatment requirement for taking sulfadiazine.\n3. Alcalinization of the urine: This is a medical intervention or treatment, not a disease. It involves making the urine less acidic, which can help prevent the formation of crystals that can lead to kidney stones or other complications. However, it can also be a sign of certain metabolic or kidney disorders, such as distal renal tubular acidosis or certain forms of kidney disease.\n\nTherefore, the potential disease entities in the paragraph could be:\n\n1. Kidney diseases or conditions that require \"exquisite control\" of renal function when treated with sulfadiazine.\n2. Distal renal tubular acidosis or other metabolic or kidney disorders that may require alcalinization of the urine as a treatment."},
