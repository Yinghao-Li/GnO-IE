Prolactin is a hormone, not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of the paragraph, so it's important to note it.\n2.

Median eminence (ME): A structure located at the base of the hypothalamus in the brain, which contains nerve endings that release hormone-releasing factors and neurotransmitters, including dopamine.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are dopamine (DA) and any other neurotransmitters or hormones that might be released from the median eminence (ME), but dopamine is the one specifically mentioned."},
