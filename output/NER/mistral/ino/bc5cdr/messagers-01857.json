    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. CB1 receptors: These are a type of G protein-coupled receptor that plays a key role in the endocannabinoid system. They are primarily located in the central and peripheral nervous system and are activated by endocannabinoids such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol.\n2. Dopaminergic lesion: This refers to damage or destruction of dopaminergic neurons, which are responsible for producing the neurotransmitter dopamine. Parkinson's disease is a common condition characterized by dopaminergic lesions in the brain.\n3. L-DOPA: L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, or L-DOPA, is an amino acid that is converted into dopamine in the brain. It is commonly used as a medication to treat Parkinson's disease by increasing the amount of dopamine available in the brain.\n4. Dyskinesias: Dyskinesias are involuntary movements that can occur as a side effect of long-term L-DOPA therapy for Parkinson's disease. They can include involuntary twisting, writhing, or repetitive movements.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are CB1 receptors, dopaminergic neurons, dopamine, L-DOPA, and dyskinesias (which are not a chemical entity but rather a condition characterized by abnormal movements)."},
