However, it can be involved in various conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders, anxiety, and seizures.\n2. Octapeptides - These are peptides consisting of eight amino acids. They are not considered diseases.\n3. Picrotoxin - This is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist and is used as a convulsant agent in animal studies. It is a toxin and can cause seizures.\n4. Seizures - This is a neurological condition characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, resulting in uncontrollable shaking or convulsions.\n5. Mortality - This refers to death. It is not a disease but an outcome or result."},
