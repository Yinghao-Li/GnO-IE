Teratogenicity: This is a condition where an agent causes structural or functional abnormalities in an developing organism.\n3. Ventricular septal defects: This is a type of congenital heart defect where there is a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart.\n4. Wavy ribs: This is a skeletal abnormality characterized by the presence of wavy or irregularly shaped ribs.\n5. Growth retardation: This refers to the impaired growth or development of an organism.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are embryolethality, teratogenicity (with specific birth defects mentioned: ventricular septal defects and wavy ribs), and growth retardation."},
