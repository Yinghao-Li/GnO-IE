The test shows how well the heart is working and can help diagnose heart conditions. ECG is not a chemical entity, but it is a medical measurement related to the electrical activity of the heart.\n2. Telemetry: Telemetry is a method of remotely transmitting data from a remote or inaccessible source to a receiving location for monitoring and recording. In this context, it refers to the use of telemetry to measure ECG values in freely moving mice, which means the data is transmitted wirelessly without the need for direct contact with the mice. Telemetry itself is not a chemical entity."},
