    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Coronary CTA: Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the coronary arteries and detect any potential blockages or stenosis. It does not contain any specific chemical entities.\n2. Cocaine: Cocaine is a strong stimulant drug of abuse derived from the leaves of the coca plant. It is a crystalline alkaloid with the chemical formula C17H21NO4H2O.\n3. Chest pain: Chest pain is a symptom, not a chemical entity.\n4. Ischemia: Ischemia is a condition characterized by insufficient blood flow to an organ or tissue, leading to damage or injury. It is not a chemical entity.\n5. Coronary vasospasm: Coronary vasospasm is a condition characterized by the narrowing of the coronary arteries due to the contraction of the smooth muscle in the artery walls. It is not a chemical entity, but it can be caused by various chemical substances, including serotonin, thromboxane A2, and endothelin-1."},

Serotonin: Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a neurotransmitter involved in various physiological processes, including mood regulation, appetite, and sleep. It is an organic compound with the chemical formula C10H12N2O.\n3. Thromboxane A2: Thromboxane A2 is a prostaglandin and a potent vasoconstrictor produced by platelets during blood clotting. It is not a chemical entity itself, but it is derived from arachidonic acid through the action of the enzyme thromboxane synthase.\n4. Endothelin-1: Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide produced by the endothelial cells of blood vessels. It is not a chemical entity itself, but it is a polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 31 amino acids."},
