It could include diseases such as glomerulonephritis, nephritis, nephrosis, polycystic kidney disease, and many others.\n2. Type IV renal tubular acidosis: This is a specific type of renal tubular disorder characterized by the inability of the kidneys to maintain the normal acid-base balance in the body. It can result in metabolic acidosis and can be caused by various medications, including prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors.\n3. Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors: These are a class of medications that inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is responsible for the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins play important roles in various physiological processes, including maintaining renal function and acid-base balance. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis can lead to type IV renal tubular acidosis."},

It is not a chemical entity, but I'm mentioning it here for context.\n3. Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors: These are a class of drugs that inhibit the enzyme responsible for the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are a group of lipid signaling molecules that play important roles in various physiological processes, including inflammation, pain, and the maintenance of renal function. Therefore, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors can be considered chemical entities."},
