Therefore, Doxorubicin is the disease-causing agent or toxin in this paragraph.\n2. Hearts of doxorubicin-treated animals: The hearts of the animals that have been treated with Doxorubicin are the affected organs or body parts.\n3. Enlarged hearts: This is a condition or symptom of heart disease, likely cardiomyopathy, which is a common side effect of Doxorubicin treatment.\n4. Hypertrophic atria: This is another condition or symptom of heart disease, where the atria (upper chambers of the heart) become thickened due to the heart muscle cells growing in size. This condition can lead to impaired blood flow and heart function.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Doxorubicin-induced heart disease or cardiotoxicity\n2. Enlarged hearts\n3. Hypertrophic atria."},
