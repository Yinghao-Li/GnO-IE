ISO infusion with stenosis: This refers to the ischemic condition caused by the infusion of ISO (Isoproterenol) and the presence of stenosis (narrowing of blood vessels). It is not a specific disease, but rather a condition or situation that can lead to various complications.\n2. Decrease in percentage segmental shortening: This is a potential complication or symptom of ischemic heart disease, which can result in reduced contractility and impaired heart function.\n3. Control value: This term likely refers to normal or expected values for percentage segmental shortening and ST segment elevation in the absence of ISO infusion and stenosis.\n4. CD-832: This is a specific drug (calcium channel blocker) used to prevent the complications of ischemic heart disease, such as decreased percentage segmental shortening and ST segment elevation.\n\nTherefore, the main diseases or conditions mentioned in the paragraph are ischemic heart disease and potential complications of ischemic heart disease, such as decreased percentage segmental shortening and ST segment elevation."},

ST-segment elevation: It is a change in the ST segment of the electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform, indicating myocardial injury or ischemia.
