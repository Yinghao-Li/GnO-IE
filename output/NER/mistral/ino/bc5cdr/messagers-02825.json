Antioxidant: Antioxidants are substances that prevent or slow damage to cells caused by free radicals, unstable molecules that the body produces as a reaction to environmental and other pressures.\n2. Bovine lactoferrin: Lactoferrin is a glycoprotein that belongs to the transferrin family. It is found in secretions such as milk, tears, and saliva. It has antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties.\n3. Dexamethasone: Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid, a type of steroid hormone. It is used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. It is known to induce hypertension (high blood pressure) in rats."},
