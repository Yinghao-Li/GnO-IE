Histamine is a substance that plays a role in allergic responses and other physiological processes. Therefore, H1 and H2 antagonists can be considered as treatments for conditions related to histamine excess or hypersensitivity, such as allergies or gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nSo, the entities in the paragraph that can be considered as diseases or conditions are:\n\n1. Allergies: Allergic responses are characterized by an overreaction of the immune system to harmless substances, leading to symptoms such as itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing. Allergies can affect various organs and systems in the body, and can be triggered by a wide range of allergens, including foods, pollen, dust mites, and insect venom.\n2. Gastrointestinal disorders: Gastrointestinal disorders refer to a group of conditions that affect the digestive system, including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and pancreas. These disorders can cause a wide range of symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea. Some common gastrointestinal disorders include inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pancreatitis.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph suggests that prior treatment with H1 and H2 antagonists provides only partial protection against allergies and gastrointestinal disorders."},
