    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Adenosine: It is a purine nucleoside and a neurotransmitter. Adenosine receptors are a family of G protein-coupled receptors that mediate the physiological effects of adenosine in the body.\n2. Adenosine receptor agonists: These are compounds that bind to and activate adenosine receptors. They can be naturally occurring (endogenous) or synthetic. Examples include caffeine (which antagonizes A1 receptors), theophylline (which antagonizes A1 and A2A receptors), and various selective agonists for different adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3)."},
