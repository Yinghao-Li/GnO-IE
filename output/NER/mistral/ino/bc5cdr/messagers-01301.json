Behavioral seizures\n\nThe term \"behavioral seizures\" refers to a type of seizure that is characterized by abnormal behavior, such as convulsions, loss of consciousness, or repetitive movements.

They are a type of chemical entity, specifically neural cells, that play a role in the development and function of the brain.\n2. Hilus: The hilus is a region in the hippocampus, which is a part of the brain. It contains various types of nerve cells, including granule cells, and is involved in the regulation of seizure activity.\n3. Behavioral seizures: Seizures are a type of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Behavioral seizures refer to seizures that are accompanied by observable changes in behavior, such as convulsions or loss of consciousness.\n4. Population: In this context, the population refers to the number of ectopic granule cells in the hilus. It is not a chemical entity itself, but it is an important factor in the correlation between the size of the population and the frequency of behavioral seizures."},
