    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Intravascular fibrin thrombi: A thrombus is a clot that forms in the blood vessels. The term \"intravascular\" indicates that the clot is formed within the lumen of a blood vessel. \"Fibrin thrombi\" specifically refers to clots that are rich in fibrin, a protein involved in the clotting process.\n2. Fibrinolytic disorders: A disorder characterized by an impaired ability to dissolve blood clots, leading to the formation of thrombi.\n3. EACA: Epsilon-Aminocaproic Acid is a medication used to prevent or treat fibrinolysis, the dissolution of blood clots.\n4. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): A condition in which the blood clots abnormally both in small blood vessels (microvascular) and in larger vessels (macrovascular), leading to various complications.\n5. Consumption coagulopathies: A group of disorders characterized by the excessive consumption of clotting factors and platelets, leading to impaired coagulation and hemorrhage.\n6. Thrombosis: The formation of a blood clot within a blood vessel.\n7. Normal renal artery: A large artery that supplies blood to the kidney.\n8.
