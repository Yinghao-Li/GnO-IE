GABA: Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) is a neurotransmitter, not a disease.\n3. L-glutamic acid decarboxylase: L-glutamic acid decarboxylase is an enzyme that plays a role in the synthesis of GABA. It is not a disease.\n4. Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR): The substantia nigra pars reticulata is a part of the brain, not a disease.\n5. Non-convulsant doses of pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is a cholinergic medication, not a disease.\n6. Severe motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus: These are the diseases or conditions mentioned in the paragraph. Seizures are abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can cause various symptoms, and status epilepticus is a state of continuous seizure activity."},
