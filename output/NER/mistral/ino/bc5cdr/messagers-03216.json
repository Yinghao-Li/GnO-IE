Proteinuria: This is a medical condition where there is an excessive amount of protein in the urine. It's not a chemical entity itself, but a symptom or condition.\n3. NGAL: Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) is a protein. It's not a chemical entity in the strict sense, but it is a biomarker that has been identified as a potential indicator of renal impairment.\n4. Serum: Serum is a clear, yellowish fluid that separates from blood when it clots. It's not a chemical entity, but a biological fluid.\n5.
