    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. SNP: SNP stands for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism. It is a genetic variation that occurs when a single nucleotide in the genome differs between individuals. It is not a chemical entity in the traditional sense, but rather a genetic marker. However, it can be associated with certain genetic diseases or conditions, and its detection and analysis involve chemical reactions and techniques, so it is sometimes referred to as a \"chemical marker\" or \"biochemical marker.\"\n2. ATP: ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is a chemical compound that serves as the primary energy currency of all known living organisms. It is a nucleotide consisting of an adenine base, a sugar molecule (ribose), and three phosphate groups. ATP is synthesized through a process called cellular respiration, and it provides energy by releasing phosphate groups when hydrolyzed by enzymes. ATP is not specifically mentioned as being used clinically in the context of the paragraph, but it is implied that it is clinically used in other countries. The exact nature of its clinical use is not specified in the paragraph."},
