However, various diseases can affect the bladder, such as bladder cancer, interstitial cystitis, and others.

It is used for labeling and detecting specific proteins or antigens in a sample, typically using fluorescently labeled antibodies.\n2. P2X3: This is a specific type of receptor, a type of ion channel receptor that is activated by ATP. It is a protein and not a chemical entity itself, but it can be found in the bladder and can be detected using immunofluorescence.\n3. NK1: This is also a specific type of receptor, a neuropeptide receptor that is activated by substance P. It is a protein and not a chemical entity itself, but it can be found in the bladder and can be detected using immunofluorescence.\n4. Bladder: This is an organ in the human body, not a chemical entity. It is where urine is stored before being expelled from the body. The expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors in the bladder is what is being investigated in the paragraph."},
