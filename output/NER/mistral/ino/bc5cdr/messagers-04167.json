Intracellular vacuoles: This is not a disease entity in itself, but it can be a sign or symptom of various diseases. In this context, it refers to empty spaces or sacs within the cells of the smooth muscle in the small arteries.\n4. Herniations: This is not a disease entity, but it refers to the abnormal bulging or protrusion of one smooth muscle cell into another, which is identified as intracellular vacuoles in this text.\n5. Ultrastructurally: This term refers to the study of structures at the level of the ultrastructure, which is beyond the resolution of a light microscope and requires the use of an electron microscope. It is not a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific disease entities mentioned in the paragraph. The text is discussing the presence of intracellular vacuoles or herniations in the smooth muscle cells of small arteries in normal rats, which is not necessarily indicative of a disease state."},

They do not contain any specific chemical compound, but their presence can indicate certain cellular processes.\n4. Herniations: These are protrusions or bulges. In this context, they are herniations of one smooth muscle cell into another. Smooth muscle cells are a type of muscle cell that does not have the ability to contract voluntarily. They are rich in myosin and actin filaments, which are proteins.\n\nTherefore, the main chemical entities in the paragraph are smooth muscle cells and proteins (myosin and actin)."},
