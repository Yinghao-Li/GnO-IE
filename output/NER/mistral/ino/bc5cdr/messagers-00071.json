Subchronic L-NOARG treatment: This refers to the chronic administration of L-Nitric Oxide Arginate (L-NOARG), a nitric oxide donor, for a subchronic period of time. L-NOARG is not a disease, but rather a treatment.\n2. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy: Catalepsy is a neurological condition characterized by rigidity, immobility, and loss of voluntary movement. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication that can induce catalepsy as a side effect. Therefore, haloperidol-induced catalepsy is the disease or condition being investigated in the study.\n3. Number of NOS neurons: NOS stands for Nitric Oxide Synthase, an enzyme that produces nitric oxide. The study is investigating the number of NOS neurons in areas related to motor control. NOS neurons are not a disease, but rather a type of neuron."},
