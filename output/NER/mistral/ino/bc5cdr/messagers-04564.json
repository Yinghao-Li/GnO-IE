It is an extraneous variable that influences both the predictor and the response variable, making it difficult to determine the true relationship between them. Confounding is a potential source of error in observational studies.\n\n2. Bias: A systematic error or distortion in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of data that can lead to incorrect conclusions. Bias can occur at any stage of the research process and can result from various sources, including selection bias, measurement bias, and reporting bias.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, the entities \"confounding\" and \"bias\" are the diseases or issues being referred to.
