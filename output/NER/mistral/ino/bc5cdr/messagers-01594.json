Anti-HCV: This is an antibody produced by the immune system in response to a hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.\n3. HBeAg: Hepatitis B e antigen is a protein produced by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) when it infects liver cells. It can be detected in the blood and is an indicator of active infection and infectivity.\n4. Anti-HBe: This is an antibody produced by the immune system in response to an HBV infection. It indicates that the body has produced an immune response against the virus, but it does not necessarily mean that the infection has been cleared.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are liver enzymes, anti-HCV, HBeAg, and anti-HBe."},
