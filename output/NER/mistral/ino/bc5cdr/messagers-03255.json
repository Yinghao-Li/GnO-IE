Protein kinase C is a family of enzymes that play a role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction. The absence of PKC-alpha could be considered a medical condition or a deficiency.\n2. Lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: This is a medical condition where the kidneys fail to respond properly to the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin, resulting in excessive urine production and dehydration. It is caused by the use of the medication lithium, which is commonly prescribed for the treatment of bipolar disorder.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Absence of PKC-alpha\n2. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Lithium-induced)"},
