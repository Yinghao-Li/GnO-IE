However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if it is being referred to as a disease or not.\n2. phenytoin prodrug: Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug. A prodrug is a biologically inactive compound that is converted into an active drug in the body. Therefore, phenytoin prodrug is not a disease entity, but rather a pharmacological concept.\n\nTherefore, there are no clear disease entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
