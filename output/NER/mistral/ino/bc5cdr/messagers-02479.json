It refers to the injection of a substance into the lateral cerebral ventricle of the brain.\n\n3.

It is not a chemical compound per se, but it is mentioned as a treatment in the paragraph.\n\n4. Cognitive deficits: This is not a chemical entity, but rather a condition or symptom. It refers to impairments in cognitive functions such as learning, memory, perception, and problem-solving abilities.\n\n5. Oral: This is a method of drug administration, not a chemical entity.
