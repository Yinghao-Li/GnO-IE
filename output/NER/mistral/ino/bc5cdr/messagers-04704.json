It works by inhibiting the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme, thereby preventing the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, a cofactor essential for the production of thymidylate and purine nucleotides, which are necessary for DNA synthesis and repair.\n\nTherefore, methotrexate is a chemical entity and specifically, it is a medication or a drug."},
