Abnormal signal intensity: This is a finding or symptom, not a disease.\n3. Both dentate nuclei of cerebellum: The dentate nuclei is a part of the cerebellum, and damage or abnormalities to this area can lead to various neurological conditions such as cerebellar atrophy, degenerative diseases like spinocerebellar atrophy, or vascular diseases like ischemic stroke.\n4. Splenium of corpus callosum: The splenium is a part of the corpus callosum, which is a large bundle of nerve fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. Damage to the splenium can lead to conditions such as callosal agenesis, callosal dysgenesis, or callosal lesions, which can result in various neurological symptoms such as hemispatial neglect, agraphia, or difficulty with motor coordination.\n\nTherefore, the diseases or conditions that can be identified from the paragraph are:\n\n1. Cerebellar atrophy or degenerative diseases\n2. Ischemic stroke\n3. Callosal agenesis, dysgenesis, or lesions."},

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI is a medical imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. It does not contain any specific chemical entities.\n2. Brain: The brain is an organ in the human body, primarily composed of water, lipids, and various proteins and electrolytes.\n3. Dentate nuclei of cerebellum: The dentate nuclei is a group of neurons located in the cerebellum, which plays a crucial role in motor coordination and learning. It contains various neurotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine.\n4. Splenium of corpus callosum: The splenium is the posterior part of the corpus callosum, a large bundle of nerve fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain.
