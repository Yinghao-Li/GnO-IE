Hepatocellular: This term refers to the liver cells, specifically the hepatocytes, which play a crucial role in metabolizing various chemicals, including drugs.\n3. Jaundice: Jaundice is a condition characterized by the yellowing of the skin and eyes due to the accumulation of bilirubin, a chemical compound produced during the breakdown of red blood cells.\n4. Progressing: This term refers to the process of moving forward or developing, which can apply to various chemical reactions or biological processes.\n5. Death: This is a biological process that ultimately results in the termination of all metabolic functions in an organism.\n6. Transplantation: This is a medical procedure that involves the transfer of an organ or tissue from one individual to another, which can be used to replace a damaged or failing organ.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are: drug, bilirubin (implied), and possibly other unmentioned drugs or chemicals that may contribute to drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice."},
