Vagal tone: The vagus nerve plays a role in the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps to regulate various body functions including heart rate. A high vagal tone can lead to a slow heart rate and decreased contractility.\n3. Bladder irrigation: This is a medical procedure where the bladder is filled with fluid through a catheter. It is not a disease, but it can be associated with certain conditions such as urinary tract infections or bladder injuries.\n4. Amiodarone-induced proarrhythmia: This is a known complication of amiodarone therapy, where the drug can cause abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the drug's effects on the heart's electrical activity and the interaction with other factors such as vagal tone."},
