    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. 5-FU: 5-Fluorouracil is an anticancer drug that belongs to the class of drugs known as antimetabolites. It works by inhibiting the production of RNA and DNA in cells, preventing cell growth and division.\n\n2. FA: 5-FU is often administered in combination with other drugs, such as Folinic Acid (also known as Leucovorin or Calcium Folinate). Folinic acid is a form of folate, a B vitamin, that helps to enhance the effectiveness of 5-FU by reducing its toxic side effects on normal cells.\n\n3. MMC: Mitomycin C is another anticancer drug that belongs to the class of drugs known as alkylating agents. It works by damaging the DNA in cancer cells, preventing them from growing and dividing.\n\n4. AGC: This abbreviation likely stands for a specific type of cancer, such as adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract or genitourinary tract. It is not a chemical entity itself."},
