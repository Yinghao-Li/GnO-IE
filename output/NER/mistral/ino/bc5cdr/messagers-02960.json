Patients: This is a general term for people and is not a chemical entity.\n3. Secondary glaucoma: Glaucoma is a medical condition characterized by increased pressure in the eye, leading to damage of the optic nerve and vision loss. It is classified into primary (POAG) and secondary forms. Secondary glaucoma is caused by an underlying condition or disease, such as diabetes, hypertension, or trauma.\n4. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG): POAG is a type of glaucoma characterized by an open angle in the drainage system of the eye and slow, progressive vision loss. It is the most common form of glaucoma and is not directly related to any underlying condition or disease.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
