Pediatric end-stage liver disease score before surgery: This is likely a clinical scoring system used to assess the severity of liver disease, and is not a specific chemical entity.\n3. Child-Pugh score before surgery: Similar to the pediatric end-stage liver disease score, this is a clinical scoring system and not a chemical entity.\n4. Serum total bilirubin after surgery: This is a chemical substance, specifically a pigmented compound produced during the metabolism of bilirubin in the liver.\n5. Trough TAC level: TAC (Tacrolimus) is an immunosuppressive drug, and the trough level refers to the concentration of the drug in the blood at the time of the lowest possible level between doses. Therefore, TAC is a chemical entity in this context."},
