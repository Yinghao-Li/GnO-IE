Triglycerides are a type of fat that the body uses for energy. When the body produces more triglycerides than it needs or when the body cannot use the triglycerides effectively, they can accumulate in various parts of the body, including the liver. This condition is also known as steatosis or fatty liver disease.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Hepatic triglyceride accumulation or fatty liver disease."},
