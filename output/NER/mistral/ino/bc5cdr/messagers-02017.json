However, various diseases can affect the liver.\n3. PB (Penicillin-based antibiotics): Antibiotics are not diseases, but they can be used to treat various diseases.\n4. Hepatocyte: Hepatocytes are the main type of cells in the liver. Damage or dysfunction of hepatocytes can lead to various liver diseases.\n5. Hepatocyte proliferation: This is a biological process, not a disease, but it can be affected in various liver diseases such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver injury.\n\nTherefore, no specific disease entities are mentioned in the paragraph. However, the paragraph discusses the effects of PB administration on the liver and hepatocyte proliferation, which can be related to various liver diseases."},

ILK: This is an abbreviation for Integrin-linked kinase, which is a protein that plays a role in cell signaling and regulation of various cellular processes, including cell survival, adhesion, and migration.\n2. liver: This is an organ in the body that plays a crucial role in metabolic processes, including the production of bile, detoxification, and the production of various proteins.\n3. mice: These are small mammals commonly used in scientific research as experimental models due to their genetic similarity to humans and ease of manipulation. They are not chemical entities, but they are mentioned in the context of an experiment.\n4. PB: This is an abbreviation for a specific chemical compound or treatment that is being administered in the experiment. However, the identity of PB is not provided in the paragraph.\n5. genes: These are segments of DNA that contain the instructions for making proteins. They are not chemical entities, but they are mentioned in the context of their expression.\n6. hepatocyte: These are the main functional cells of the liver, responsible for metabolic processes such as protein synthesis, glycogen storage, and bile production.\n7. proliferation: This is a biological process involving the production of new cells from existing cells. It is not a chemical entity, but it is mentioned in the context of gene expression.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are ILK and PB."},
