They are a major group of organisms that play a key role in the decomposition and recycling of organic matter, and they are essential for the normal functioning of ecosystems.

Screening: This is a process used to identify the presence or absence of something, such as a disease or contaminant, in a sample. In the context of the paragraph, \"screening\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a process used to detect the presence or absence of bacteria.\n3. Evidence: This is information that provides proof or confirmation of something. In the context of the paragraph, \"evidence\" refers to the results of the bacteriological screening, which failed to provide proof of bacterial infection.\n4. Infection: An infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, such as bacteria or viruses. In the context of the paragraph, \"infection\" is not a chemical entity, but rather a biological condition that the screening failed to detect.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"bacteria.\""},
