It is not considered a disease itself, but rather a response to various conditions.\n2. Cranial circulation: This term refers to the blood flow to the head and brain. It is not a disease, but rather a part of the circulatory system.\n3. Systemic circulation: This term refers to the part of the circulatory system that carries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. It is not a disease, but rather a part of the circulatory system.\n4. Pulmonary circulation: This term refers to the part of the circulatory system that carries blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs and then back to the left atrium. It is not a disease, but rather a part of the circulatory system.\n5. Coronary circulation: This term refers to the blood flow to the heart muscle itself. Diseases that affect coronary circulation include coronary artery disease, coronary artery spasms, and coronary artery thrombosis."},

Systemic circulation: This is the part of the circulatory system that carries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body.\n4. Pulmonary circulation: This is the part of the circulatory system that carries deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs, where it is oxygenated, and then carries oxygenated blood back to the left side of the heart.\n5. Coronary circulation: This is the blood supply to the heart muscle itself.\n\nThere are no specific chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph, but vasopressors are often medications that can be administered intravenously and have specific chemical structures. For example, phenylephrine and albuterol are common vasopressors with distinct chemical structures."},
