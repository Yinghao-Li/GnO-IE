Decreased Expression: This refers to a reduction in the presence or activity of certain substances, in this case, the Na / K - ATPase, NHE3, NBC1, AQP1, and OAT proteins.\n3. Na / K - ATPase: This is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane.\n4. NHE3: This is a type of sodium-hydrogen exchanger that helps regulate the pH of cells and maintain the balance of sodium and hydrogen ions.\n5. NBC1: This is a sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter that helps maintain the pH balance in the body by transporting bicarbonate ions into cells in exchange for sodium ions.\n6. AQP1: This is a type of water channel protein that helps regulate water balance in the body.\n7. OAT: This refers to organic anion transporters, which are proteins that help transport various organic anions across cell membranes.\n\nTherefore, the entities in the paragraph related to diseases are:\n\n1. Gentamicin-induced Nephropathy."},

Na / K - ATPase: Sodium-potassium ATPase is an enzyme that pumps sodium ions out of and potassium ions into cells using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source.\n2. NHE3: Sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) is a transporter protein that exchanges sodium ions for hydrogen ions in the kidney.\n3. NBC1: Sodium-bicarbonate co-transporter 1 (NBC1) is a transporter protein that facilitates the reabsorption of bicarbonate ions and sodium ions in the kidney.\n4. AQP1: Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is a water channel protein that facilitates water reabsorption in the kidney.\n5. OAT: Organic anion transporter (OAT) is a family of transporter proteins that facilitate the reabsorption of various organic anions in the kidney.\n\nTherefore, the identified chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
