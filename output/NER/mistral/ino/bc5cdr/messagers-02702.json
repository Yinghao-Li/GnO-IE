It is involved in various physiological processes including memory and learning. In this context, it can be considered a \"Disease or Disorder\" entity if we consider that an imbalance or dysregulation of CCK-8 can lead to several neurological and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and Alzheimer's disease.\n\n2. Hippocampal LTP: Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) is a cellular process that underlies learning and memory in the brain. It is a form of synaptic plasticity, which is the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experience. In this context, it can be considered a \"Condition or Syndrome\" entity as it is a normal physiological process that can be enhanced or impaired in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n\n3. Saline: Saline is a solution of sodium chloride in water, which is used for various medical purposes such as intravenous fluid replacement, wound irrigation, and as a control or placebo in medical research. In this context, it is not considered a \"Disease or Disorder\" entity.\n\n4. Rats: Rats are a common laboratory animal used in biomedical research. They are not considered a \"Disease or Disorder\" entity."},
