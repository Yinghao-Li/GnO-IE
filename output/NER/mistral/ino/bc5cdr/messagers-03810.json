Pilocarpine is an example of a cholinomimetic.\n2. Pilocarpine: This is a specific type of cholinomimetic drug. It is used therapeutically to decrease secretion from the salivary glands, decrease heart rate, and reduce pupil size.\n3. Peripheral cholinergic receptors: These are types of receptors located outside the central nervous system that bind to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and initiate a response.\n4. Acetylcholine: This is a neurotransmitter, a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the nervous system. It acts on both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.\n\nSo, the chemical entities in the paragraph are: cholinomimetic (pilocarpine), pilocarpine, peripheral cholinergic receptors, and acetylcholine."},
