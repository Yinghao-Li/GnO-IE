It is not a disease.\n4. epicardial APD: Action Potential Duration (APD) is a measure of the time it takes for a cardiac muscle cell to depolarize and repolarize. It is not a disease, but a physiological parameter.\n5. diminished TDR: TDR stands for Tissue Delay Ratio. It is a measure of the difference in refractoriness between the endocardium and epicardium of the heart. A diminished TDR is not a disease, but a physiological finding.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities in the paragraph."},

It is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers of sotalol, a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and a selective beta-blocker.\n2. Azimilide: This is another specific chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is a class III antiarrhythmic drug, specifically an azole derivative, which prolongs the QT interval and shortens the QT dispersion.\n3. micromol/L: This is a unit of measurement for micromoles per liter. It is not a chemical entity itself, but it is mentioned in relation to the concentration of azimilide.\n4. epicardial APD: This stands for epicardial action potential duration, which is a measure of the duration of the electric signal in the heart's epicardial tissue during a heartbeat. It is not a chemical entity, but it is affected by the presence of certain chemicals, such as azimilide.\n5. TDR: This stands for transmembrane action potential duration difference, which is the difference in action potential duration between the endocardium and epicardium of the heart. It is not a chemical entity, but it is affected by the presence of certain chemicals, such as azimilide."},
