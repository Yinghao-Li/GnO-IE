    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Controlled hypotension anesthesia: This term refers to a deliberate reduction in blood pressure during anesthesia for surgical procedures. It is achieved by administering medications such as beta-blockers, vasodilators, or by using techniques like nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics.\n2. FRLMA: FRLMA stands for Facilitated Rapid Sequence Induction with Laryngeal Mask Airway. It is a technique used for airway management during anesthesia, where a laryngeal mask airway is inserted before the patient is fully anesthetized.\n3. TIVA: Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) is a method of providing anesthesia where all the anesthetic drugs are administered intravenously, rather than through inhalation. Commonly used drugs for TIVA include propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium.\n4. FESS: Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is a surgical procedure used to treat various conditions affecting the sinuses, such as chronic sinusitis, nasal polyps, and fungal sinusitis.\n5. Remifentanil: It is an opioid analgesic medication used for pain management during surgery. It is administered intravenously and has a short half-life, making it suitable for use in TIVA."},
