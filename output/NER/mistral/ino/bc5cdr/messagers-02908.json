Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Tumor lysis syndrome is not a disease itself but a complication or a set of metabolic disturbances that can occur as a result of cancer treatment. It is caused by the rapid breakdown of cancer cells, leading to the release of various substances (such as uric acid, potassium, phosphorus, and calcium) into the bloodstream. These substances can then cause various complications, such as kidney damage (as in this case). Therefore, TLS is often considered a disease condition or a complication of cancer."},
