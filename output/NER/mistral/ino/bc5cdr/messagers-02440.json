It is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.\n2. Motor fluctuations: This is a complication or symptom that can develop in individuals with PD who have been on chronic levodopa therapy for an extended period. It refers to the irregular and unpredictable return of motor symptoms (on-off phenomenon) between doses of levodopa.\n3. Dyskinesia: This is another complication or symptom that can develop in individuals with PD who have been on chronic levodopa therapy. It refers to involuntary, abnormal movements that can include chorea (rapid, jerky movements), athetoid movements (twisting and writhing movements), and dystonic movements (sustained, repetitive movements or postures).\n\nTherefore, the disease entities in the paragraph are Parkinson's disease, motor fluctuations, and dyskinesia."},
