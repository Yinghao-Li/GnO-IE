Combined therapy: This refers to the use of two or more medicines together.\n3. Cyclosporin A: This is an immunosuppressive drug. Immunosuppression is a condition where the body's immune system is suppressed, making it less able to fight infections.\n4. Nifedipine: This is a calcium channel blocker, which is a type of medication used to treat high blood pressure and angina (chest pain).\n5. Increase in blood urea nitrogen levels: This is a condition where the level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood is higher than normal. BUN is a waste product produced when the body breaks down proteins. High levels of BUN can indicate kidney damage or other health problems.\n6. Gingival hyperplasia: This is a condition where the gums become enlarged or overgrown. It can be a side effect of certain medications, including cyclosporin A."},
