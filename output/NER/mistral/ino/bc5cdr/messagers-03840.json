    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Aminonucleoside: This is a type of nucleoside, which is an organic compound that contains a nitrogenous base and a sugar moiety. Nucleosides are the building blocks of nucleotides, which are essential components of DNA and RNA.\n2. Nephrosis: Nephrosis is a type of kidney disease characterized by the loss of the selective permeability of the glomerular filtration membrane, leading to proteinuria and edema.\n3. Mesangial function: Mesangial cells are a type of cell found in the mesangium, which is the central part of the glomerular tuft in the kidney. They play a role in maintaining the structure and function of the glomerulus by producing extracellular matrix components and regulating blood flow.\n4. Glomerular sclerosis: Glomerular sclerosis is a type of scarring or fibrosis that occurs in the glomeruli of the kidney. It is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins and the loss of normal glomerular structure and function."},
