However, in the context of the given paragraph, PDN is most likely referring to Pyridoxine Deficiency Neuropathy, a neurological condition caused by deficiency of vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine).\n2. Anxiety: A mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry, fear, and apprehension, often to an excessive degree.\n3. Reactivity of microglia: Microglia are a type of immune cells found in the central nervous system. Reactivity refers to their activation state, which can be increased in response to injury or disease. In this context, the paragraph suggests that microglia become reactive due to subacute exposure to Pyridoxine Deficiency."},
