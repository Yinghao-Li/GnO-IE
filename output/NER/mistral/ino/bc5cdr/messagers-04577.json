    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Third-generation progestagens: This term refers to a class of progestogen-only contraceptives or combined oral contraceptives that contain third-generation progestogens. Progestogens are hormones used in hormonal contraceptives to prevent ovulation and thicken cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the egg.\n2. VTE: Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition characterized by the formation of a blood clot in a vein, which can obstruct blood flow and potentially travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism.\n3. Desogestrel: Desogestrel is a synthetic progestogen used in various forms of hormonal contraceptives, including the combined oral contraceptive pill and the progestogen-only pill.\n4. Ethinyloestradiol: Ethinyloestradiol is a synthetic estrogen used in combined oral contraceptives to prevent ovulation and thicken cervical mucus.\n\nSo, the entities related to diseases in the paragraph are \"Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)\" and \"blood clot\" (implied in VTE)."},
