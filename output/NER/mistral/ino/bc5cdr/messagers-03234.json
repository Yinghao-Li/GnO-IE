However, it implies the presence of substances indicative of disease activity.\n2. Signs of ocular inflammation: This refers to the presence of inflammatory chemicals in the eye, such as cytokines, chemokines, and immune cells.\n3. Evidence of retinal vasculitis: Retinal vasculitis is an inflammatory condition that affects the blood vessels in the retina. It may be associated with the presence of certain antibodies, such as anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) or anti-phospholipid antibodies.\n4. Swedish interactive threshold algorithm - short wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP): SWAP is a type of visual field test used to assess vision. It does not directly refer to a specific chemical entity.\n5. Humphrey visual field analysis: Humphrey visual field analysis is a method used to measure visual function and detect abnormalities. It does not directly refer to a specific chemical entity.\n6. Electroretinographic parameters: Electroretinography (ERG) is a test used to evaluate the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. It may provide information about the presence of certain chemicals, such as retinal rod and cone photopigments, and neurotransmitters.\n7. Optical coherence tomography: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique used to assess the structure of the retina and other tissues in the eye. It does not directly refer to a specific chemical entity."},
