Genes: Genes are not chemical entities per se, but they carry the information that determines the structure and function of proteins and RNA molecules, which are chemical entities.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Proteins: Proteins are large biomolecules made up of long chains of amino acids. They play a crucial role in various functions in the body, including catalysis, structural support, and signaling.\n2. RNA (Ribonucleic Acid): RNA is a type of nucleic acid that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome for protein synthesis. It is also involved in various other cellular functions, such as translation, regulation, and intracellular transport.\n\nSo, the paragraph mentions the involvement of genes in the expression of growth and morphological changes, which is due to the production of proteins and RNA molecules."},
