    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Human - induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs): These are not diseases per se, but rather a type of cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), which are reprogrammed adult cells capable of differentiating into any cell type. Cardiomyocytes are muscle cells that make up the heart.\n\n2. QT interval: The QT interval is a measurement on an electrocardiogram (ECG) that represents the time it takes for the heart to electrically depolarize and repolarize after a heartbeat. Prolonged QT intervals can indicate various heart conditions, including some life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\n3. K ( + ) channels: Potassium channels are ion channels that allow the flow of potassium ions (K+) into and out of cells. Dysfunction of these channels can lead to various heart conditions, such as long QT syndrome, which is characterized by prolonged QT intervals and an increased risk of arrhythmias.\n\n4. Ca ( 2 + ) channels: Calcium channels are ion channels that allow the flow of calcium ions (Ca2+) into cells. Dysfunction of these channels can also lead to various heart conditions, such as long QT syndrome and other arrhythmias.\n\n5. Electrocardiogram (ECG): An ECG is a diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. It is used to diagnose and monitor heart conditions, including arrhythmias and heart damage.\n\nTherefore, the entities related to diseases in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Long QT syndrome\n2. Arrhythmias."},
