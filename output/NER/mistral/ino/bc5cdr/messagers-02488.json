It refers to the impaired function of the tubules in the kidneys.\n3.

It can be caused by various genetic or acquired factors, including certain chemicals and drugs.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are the various substances that can cause kidney conditions mentioned, such as toxins, drugs, and chemicals that lead to Fanconi syndrome.
