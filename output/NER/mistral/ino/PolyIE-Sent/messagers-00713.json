The bandgap is a property that describes the energy required to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band in a material.\n2. Donor - acceptor (D-A) approach: This is a method used to create low-band-gap polymers by introducing donor and acceptor groups into the polymer structure. Donor groups are electron-rich, while acceptor groups are electron-poor.\n3. Absorption maxima: This refers to the wavelength of light at which a material absorbs the most photons. It is a property that describes the position of the absorption peak in the electromagnetic spectrum.\n4. Redshifted: This means that the absorption maxima have been shifted towards longer wavelengths (redder colors). This is a common effect in organic semiconductors and is often desirable for applications in optoelectronics.\n5. Decreasing the number of absorbed photons in the visible region: This refers to the fact that redshifted absorption maxima result in fewer absorbed photons in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n6. Achievable photocurrent: This is the electrical current generated in a material in response to light absorption. The number of absorbed photons and the material's ability to transport charge determine the achievable photocurrent."
