It is desirable for the polymers to have high performance, which likely means they are effective and efficient in their intended applications.\n3. Low band gap: This is another property or characteristic of the polymers being developed. A low band gap refers to the energy required for an electron to be excited from the valence band to the conduction band in a material. In the context of polymers, a low band gap means that the polymers are more conductive and can transfer electrons more easily, which is desirable for certain applications."
