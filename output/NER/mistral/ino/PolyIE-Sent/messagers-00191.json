Active layer: This refers to the layer where the active material is present, responsible for the electrical conductivity and charge transport in a device such as a solar cell or a field-effect transistor. In this context, the active layer is the material whose thickness is specified as 80-90 nm.\n\n2. PC: This is likely an abbreviation for a specific type of copolymer. Copolymers are polymers that consist of two or more different types of monomers. In this context, PC is likely a material name.\n\n3. BM: This is likely another abbreviation for a specific type of copolymer. Given that the ratio of PC to BM is 1 : 2, it is reasonable to assume that BM is a different material than PC.\n\n4. Ca / Al: Calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al) are elements and are not materials per se, but they are mentioned as the cathode material. The cathode is the electrode that undergoes reduction during the operation of an electrochemical cell or device, such as a battery or a fuel cell. In this context, Ca/Al likely refers to a specific type of cathode material, possibly a calcium-aluminum alloy or a composite material containing both calcium and aluminum."
