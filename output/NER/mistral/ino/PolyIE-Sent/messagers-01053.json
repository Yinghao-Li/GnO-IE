ICT behavior: Internal charge transfer behavior is a material property or phenomenon, not a material name.\n2. side-chain D-A structure: D-A structure is a type of molecular structure, where D represents one part of the molecule and A represents another part. In this context, it is likely referring to a donor-acceptor structure, so we could consider it as a type of side-chain material.\n3. resultant polymers: Polymers are a type of material, specifically macromolecules made up of repeating subunits.\n4. band gap (Eg): Band gap is a material property, specifically the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in a solid.\n5. isotropic charge transport: Isotropic charge transport is a material property, specifically the even distribution of charge transport in all directions within a material."
