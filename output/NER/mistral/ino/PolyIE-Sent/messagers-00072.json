The specific name of the donor polymer is not mentioned in the paragraph, so it is identified as a \"Material Name\" entity with the role of a donor polymer.\n2. PC71BM: This is a specific acceptor material with the acronym PC71BM. It is identified as a \"Material Name\" entity with the role of an acceptor material.\n3. HOMO energy level: HOMO stands for Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital. It is an energy level in a molecule or polymer where all the electrons are paired up in bonds. It is identified as an energy level related to the donor polymer, so it is not a Material Name entity, but it is important to identify it for understanding the context.\n4. LUMO energy level: LUMO stands for Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital. It is an energy level in a molecule or polymer where electrons can be added. It is identified as an energy level related to the acceptor material, PC71BM, so it is not a Material Name entity, but it is important to identify it for understanding the context.\n5. V oc: Voc stands for Open Circuit Voltage, which is a measure of the maximum voltage that a photovoltaic device can generate under illumination. It is identified as a voltage value, but it is important to achieve a large value of Voc in a solar device, so it is related to the Material Name entities mentioned in the paragraph."

It refers to the alignment of the energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) of different materials, in this case, donor polymers and PC71BM.\n2. HOMO energy level: HOMO stands for Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital. It is a property of a molecule or a material that describes the energy level of the last electron to be added to a neutral molecule or material.\n3. LUMO energy level: LUMO stands for Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital. It is a property of a molecule or a material that describes the energy level of the first electron to be removed from a neutral molecule or material.\n4. PC71BM: PC71BM is a specific acceptor material used in organic electronics, particularly in organic photovoltaic cells. It is a fullerene derivative and its LUMO energy level is being referred to in the paragraph.\n5. V oc: V oc stands for Open Circuit Voltage. It is a property of a solar cell that describes the voltage difference between the electrodes when the solar cell is not supplying any current. A larger V oc indicates a more efficient solar cell."
