Electrochemical properties refer to the chemical changes that occur in a material when an electric potential is applied.\n3. Copolymers are polymers that contain more than one type of repeating monomer unit.\n4. Perylene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which can be used as a building block for the synthesis of copolymers."
