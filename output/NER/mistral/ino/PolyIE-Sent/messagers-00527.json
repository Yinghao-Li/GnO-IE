The open-circuit voltage (Voc) is the voltage at which the photovoltaic cell produces no current because the voltage output is greater than the voltage input (i.e., no external load is connected). A high open-circuit voltage indicates that the solar cell can effectively convert sunlight into electrical energy with minimal energy loss."
