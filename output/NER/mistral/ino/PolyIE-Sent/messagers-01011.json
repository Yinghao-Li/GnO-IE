To identify the material names, we need to look for the base materials that PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are derived from. Unfortunately, the paragraph does not provide enough context to determine the base materials.\n2. The paragraph mentions \"calculated saturation hole mobilities\" for PTATDPP and PTAFDPP. A material's mobility is a property that describes how easily its charge carriers move through the material. Therefore, we can infer that PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are semiconductor materials.\n3. Without further context, it is impossible to determine the exact material names based on the given information alone."
