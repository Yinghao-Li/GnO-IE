In this context, it is likely referring to the I-V characteristics of the Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. J: This is a symbol that represents the current density in the context of electrical circuits and materials. In this paragraph, it is likely referring to the current density in the J-V characteristics of the PSCs.\n3. sc: This is an abbreviation for \"short circuit.\" In the context of solar cells, the short circuit current (Isc) is the current that flows when the solar cell is short-circuited, i.e., when the output terminals are connected together.\n4. V oc: This is an abbreviation for \"open circuit voltage.\" In the context of solar cells, the open circuit voltage (Voc) is the voltage across the solar cell when it is not connected to a load, i.e., when the output terminals are not connected to anything.\n5. FF: This stands for \"fill factor.\" In the context of solar cells, the fill factor (FF) is a measure of the efficiency of a solar cell to convert solar energy into electrical energy.\n6. PCE: This stands for \"power conversion efficiency.\" In the context of solar cells, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is the ratio of the electrical power output of a solar cell to the total solar energy that is incident on it.\n\nSo, the Material Name entities in the paragraph are \"Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs)\" and the parameters of these cells are \"J-V characteristics,\" \"current density (J),\" \"short circuit current (Isc),\" \"open circuit voltage (Voc),\" \"fill factor (FF),\" and \"power conversion efficiency (PCE).\""
