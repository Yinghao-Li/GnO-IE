Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure: This is not a material itself but a specific type of structure used in polymer solar cells. However, it's important to identify it as it is the context for the materials mentioned next.\n\n2. Conjugated polymers: These are a type of material, specifically polymers with conjugated systems, which are electron donors in the BHJ structure.\n\n3. Fullerene derivatives: These are a type of material, specifically derivatives of fullerenes, which are electron acceptors in the BHJ structure."
