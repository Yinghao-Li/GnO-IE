The square brackets contain the structural information about the molecule. The numbers and letters within the brackets represent the number of carbon atoms and the way they are connected in the ring structure. In this case, the name suggests a dithieno ring system, which consists of two thiophene rings fused together in a specific way. The phthalimide part of the name is not included in this identifier, as it is a separate functional group attached to the dithieno ring."
