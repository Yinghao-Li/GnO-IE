Therefore, it can be identified as a \"Material Property\" or \"Material Characteristic\" entity, with a more specific label of \"Hole Mobility\" or \"Measured Hole Mobility\".\n\n2. Electron mobility: Similar to the above, this is also a material property or characteristic, specifically related to the movement of electrons in the material's electrical conductivity. So, it can be identified as a \"Material Property\" or \"Material Characteristic\" entity, with a more specific label of \"Electron Mobility\" or \"Measured Electron Mobility\".\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are not explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests that the paragraph is discussing material properties or characteristics, and the specific properties mentioned are hole mobility and electron mobility. So, no explicit material names are given in the paragraph."
