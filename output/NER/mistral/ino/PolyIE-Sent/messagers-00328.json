The more quinoid character, the more the polymer's structure resembles a quinoid structure, which is known to have a smaller bandgap than the corresponding thiophene structure.\n3. Earlier studies: These are previous research works that have reported similar findings about the effect of replacing thiophene with selenophene on the optical properties of polymers.\n4. Experimental studies: These are research experiments that have been conducted to investigate the relationship between the structure of polymers and their optical properties, specifically the effect of replacing thiophene with selenophene.\n\nTherefore, the property values in the paragraph are the reduction of the optical bandgap and the increase of quinoid character."
