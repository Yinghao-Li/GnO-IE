Some common thermal properties include:\n   - Melting point: The temperature at which a solid transitions into a liquid.\n   - Boiling point: The temperature at which a liquid transitions into a gas.\n   - Specific heat capacity: The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius or Kelvin.\n   - Thermal conductivity: The ability of a material to transfer heat energy from one part to another.\n   - Heat of fusion: The amount of heat energy required to melt a substance.\n   - Heat of vaporization: The amount of heat energy required to turn a liquid into a gas.\n\nIn the given paragraph, the thermal properties are mentioned in a general sense, but no specific thermal property is mentioned. Therefore, no specific thermal property entity can be identified from the paragraph. However, molecular weight is a clear property value entity mentioned in the paragraph."
