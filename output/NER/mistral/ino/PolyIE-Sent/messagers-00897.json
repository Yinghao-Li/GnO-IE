An acceptor in chemistry is a substance that can accept an electron, so a strong acceptor is a substance that accepts electrons more readily than a weak acceptor.\n3.

In this context, the weak donor moieties can maintain low HOMO levels, meaning that the energy required to remove an electron from the HOMO is relatively high.\n4. band gap: The band gap is the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in a material. In this context, the strong acceptor moieties may result in a narrow band gap via intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), meaning that the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is relatively small."
