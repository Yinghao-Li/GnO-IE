      "content": "1. PDTP-BT, PDTP-DTBT, PDTP-DT2BT: These are the names of the copolymers. In the context of materials science and polymer science, \"copolymers\" are a type of polymer where at least two different types of monomers are used in their synthesis. Therefore, these entities can be considered as \"Property Name\" entities representing specific types of copolymers with certain photovoltaic properties.\n\n2. PSCs: This stands for \"Perovskite Solar Cells.\" It is a type of solar cell that uses a perovskite-structured compound as the light-harvesting active layer. Therefore, \"PSCs\" can be considered as a \"Property Name\" entity representing a specific type of solar cell.\n\n3. ITO: Indium Tin Oxide is a type of conductive oxide material commonly used as a transparent electrode in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and flat-panel displays. Therefore, \"ITO\" can be considered as a \"Property Name\" entity representing a specific type of conductive material.\n\n4. PEDOT : PSS: Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) is a conducting polymer that is widely used as a hole transport layer in organic photovoltaic cells. Therefore, \"PEDOT : PSS\" can be considered as a \"Property Name\" entity representing a specific type of conducting polymer.\n\n5. Polymer : PC 70 BM: This entity likely refers to a specific type of polymer: fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM or PC70BM). Fullerenes are a type of carbon allotrope, and PC70BM is a fullerene derivative that is commonly used as an electron transport material in organic photovoltaic cells. Therefore, \"Polymer : PC 70 BM\" can be considered as a \"Property Name\" entity representing a specific type of fullerene derivative.\n\n6. Ca: Calcium is a chemical element with the symbol Ca and atomic number 20. It is a soft, silvery-white alkaline earth metal. In the context of solar cells, calcium is often used as a dopant to improve the performance of the perovskite layer. Therefore, \"Ca\" can be considered as a \"Property Name\" entity representing a specific type of dopant material.\n\n7. Al: Aluminum is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13. It is a silvery-white, soft, non-magnetic, ductile metal. In the context of solar cells, aluminum is often used as a back contact material. Therefore, \"Al\" can be considered as a \"Property Name\" entity representing a specific type of metal used as a back contact material."
