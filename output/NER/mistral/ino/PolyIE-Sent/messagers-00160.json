The material name is not explicitly mentioned in this phrase, but it can be inferred from the context that it is the material present in the solution.\n2. Absorption maximum wavelength in the films: Similar to the above, this refers to the wavelength at which the absorption of light by the material in film form is maximum. Again, the material name is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred from the context.\n3. Optical band gap: This is a material property, not a material name. It is the energy required to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band in a material.\n4. Deduced from the absorption onsets: This refers to the process of determining the optical band gap from the absorption onsets in the spectra. It does not refer to a material name."
