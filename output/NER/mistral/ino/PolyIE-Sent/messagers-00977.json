PSC: This is an abbreviation for \"Perovskite Solar Cells.\" It is not a material name in this context, but rather a type of solar cell.\n4. Polymers: This is a material category. It refers to large molecules made up of repeating subunits.\n5. Arene groups: This is a material name. Arene is a chemical class of aromatic hydrocarbons, which are characterized by the presence of a planar ring system of carbon atoms. The introduction of arene groups into polymers is a way to modify their electronic properties."
