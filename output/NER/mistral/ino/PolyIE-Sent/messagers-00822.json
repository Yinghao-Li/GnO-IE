However, it sets the context for the following information about two specific polymers.\n\n2. Onset decomposition temperatures\n\n\"Onset decomposition temperatures\" is a property or characteristic of materials, specifically related to thermal stability. It refers to the temperature at which a material begins to decompose when heated.\n\n3. 5% weight loss\n\n\"5% weight loss\" is a quantitative measure related to the decomposition of materials. It indicates the temperature at which a material has lost 5% of its weight during the decomposition process.\n\n4. 313-320 °C\n\n\"313-320 °C\" is a range of temperatures, specifically temperatures in degrees Celsius. It indicates the temperature range at which the onset decomposition temperatures for the two polymers occur.\n\nTherefore, the Material Name entities in the paragraph are not explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests that the two polymers are the materials of interest."
