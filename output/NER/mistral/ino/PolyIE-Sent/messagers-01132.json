Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV): This is a technique used to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. It is not a property itself but a method used to measure the properties HOMO and LUMO.\n2. Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO): This is a property of a molecule that represents the energy level of the last electron to enter the molecule during oxidation.\n3. Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO): This is a property of a molecule that represents the energy level of the first electron to leave the molecule during reduction.\n4. PDTP-DTDPP-(Bu): This is the name of the molecule whose HOMO and LUMO energy levels are being determined."
