It is a complex name that includes several rings and functional groups, including thieno, pyrido, g, thieno, isoquinoline, dione, thieno, and pyrido again. It is one entity and can be referred to as \"thieno[2′,3′ : 5′,6′]pyrido [ 3,4- g]- thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione\" or simply as \"this terpolymer\" or \"the first material\" in the context of the paragraph.\n\n2. thiophene(T)\nThis is the name of one of the monomers used in the synthesis of the terpolymers. It is a simple name that refers to a specific type of ring, thiophene. It is one entity and can be referred to as \"thiophene\" or \"monomer T\" in the context of the paragraph.\n\n3. dithiophene (2T)\nThis is the name of another monomer used in the synthesis of the terpolymers. It is similar to thiophene but includes two thiophene rings. It is one entity and can be referred to as \"dithiophene\" or \"monomer 2T\" in the context of the paragraph."
