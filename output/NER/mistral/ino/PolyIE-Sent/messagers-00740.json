Specifically, the paragraph refers to \"the composition of the electron-deficient units\" in the copolymers P2-P6. This suggests that there are different types of electron-deficient units being incorporated into these copolymers.\n3. The parent polymers, P1 and P7, are also mentioned as having electron-deficient units, but the paragraph does not specify what type of units they contain. Therefore, we cannot determine if P1 and P7 have the same or different electron-deficient units as P2-P6 based on the given information.\n\nSo, the Material Name entities in the paragraph are the different types of electron-deficient units being incorporated into the copolymers P2-P6."
