The acronym PTATDPP stands for Poly(3,4-Thienadithiophene-2,5-diyl-alt-2,5-thiophenedithiophene), which is a type of conjugated polymer.\n\n2. PTAFDPP: This is likely another type of Polythiophene-based donor material. The acronym PTAFDPP stands for Poly(3,4-Thienadithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,5-fluorothiophene), which is a variant of the conjugated polymer with fluorine atoms incorporated into the thiophene rings.\n\n3. PC71BM: This is likely a fullerene-based acceptor material. The acronym PC71BM stands for [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, which is a type of fullerene derivative.\n\nSo, the Material Name entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. PTATDPP\n2.
