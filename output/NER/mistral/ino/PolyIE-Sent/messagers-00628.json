The term \"polythiophene derivative\" indicates that these polymers are based on the thiophene structure and have undergone some modification.\n3. PDI-dithienothiophene copolymer acceptors: These are polymers that act as electron acceptors in the solar cell. The term \"PDI-dithienothiophene copolymer\" indicates that these polymers are based on the PDI (perylene diimide) structure and contain dithienothiophene units.\n4. power conversion efficiencies (PCEs): This is a measure of how efficiently a solar cell converts sunlight into electricity.\n5. AM1.5: This is a standard solar spectrum used to test the performance of solar cells.\n6. 100 mW cm^-2: This is the intensity of the light used to measure the power conversion efficiency of the solar cells."

Therefore, they can be considered irrelevant for the purpose of identifying material properties."
