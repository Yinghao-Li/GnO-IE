Broad absorption extending to or surpassing 1 μm: This refers to the ability of the photovoltaic μmR polymers to absorb a wide range of the solar spectrum, specifically in the infrared region (1 μm and beyond).\n2. High LUMO energy level: LUMO stands for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. In this context, a high LUMO energy level means that the energy level of the LUMO of the photovoltaic μmR polymers is high enough to facilitate effective charge transfer to the acceptor in the BHJ (bulk heterojunction) device.\n3. Low HOMO energy level: HOMO stands for the highest occupied molecular orbital. A low HOMO energy level in the photovoltaic μmR polymers is desirable to maintain a high open circuit voltage (VOC) in the BHJ device.\n4. High carrier mobility: Carrier mobility refers to the ability of charge carriers (electrons or holes) to move through a material. A high carrier mobility in the photovoltaic μmR polymers ensures efficient charge transport to the electrodes, reducing photocurrent loss.\n5. Good solubility: The photovoltaic μmR polymers should have good solubility to facilitate solution processing, which is a common method used to form high-quality films for BHJ devices.\n6. Appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives: Compatibility with fullerene derivatives is important for forming high-quality films by solution processing. The photovoltaic μmR polymers and fullerene derivatives should be able to mix well and form a homogeneous blend to optimize the performance of the BHJ device."
