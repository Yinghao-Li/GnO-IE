It is a five-membered ring with one sulfur atom and four carbon atoms. The presence of the sulfur atom makes it a heterocyclic compound. Thienyl rings are commonly found in organic compounds and can be used as building blocks in the synthesis of various materials. In this context, the paragraph suggests that the presence of a thienyl ring can improve the charge carrier mobility in certain materials due to enhanced π-π stacking interactions."
