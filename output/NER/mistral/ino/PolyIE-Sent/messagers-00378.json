It is the ability of the material to move charges from one part to another.\n3. π-π interaction: This is a type of intermolecular force that occurs between aromatic molecules or rings. It is a force that arises from the overlapping of their π electrons. In this context, it is a property that is being enhanced between the polymer chains to improve the charge transport ability."
