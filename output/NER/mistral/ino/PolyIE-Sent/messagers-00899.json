Carrier mobility: This is a property that describes how easily charge carriers (electrons or holes) can move through a material.\n4. Reduced band gaps: A band gap is the energy difference between the conduction band and the valence band in a material. A reduced band gap means that it requires less energy to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, making the material more efficient at conducting electricity."
