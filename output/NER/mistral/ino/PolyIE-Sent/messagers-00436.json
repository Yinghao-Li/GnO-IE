ITO: ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) is a material commonly used in the fabrication of thin-film transistors and other electronic devices due to its excellent electrical conductivity and transparency. It is typically made by coating a substrate with a thin layer of indium oxide, followed by a layer of tin oxide. The resulting material is a conductive oxide that is widely used in touchscreens, solar cells, and other applications.\n\nTherefore, in the given paragraph, \"ITO\" is the Material Name entity."
