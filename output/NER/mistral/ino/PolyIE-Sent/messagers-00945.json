It is mentioned as having stronger absorption in the visible region compared to another material, PC61BM.\n2. PC61BM: This is another specific type of material or compound, likely a polymer, used in organic photovoltaic cells (PSCs). It is mentioned as having weaker absorption in the visible region compared to PC71BM.\n3. acceptor: This term refers to a material that accepts electrons in a chemical reaction or in the context of a semiconductor device, such as an organic photovoltaic cell. In this context, PC71BM is identified as the acceptor material.\n4. polymers: Polymers are large molecules made up of repeating subunits. In this context, they are likely the organic semiconductor materials used in the organic photovoltaic cells (PSCs).\n5. absorption valley: This term refers to the region of the electromagnetic spectrum where a material absorbs the least amount of energy. In the context of organic photovoltaic cells, the absorption valley of the polymers refers to the region where they absorb the least amount of visible light.\n6. high-efficiency PSCs: Polymer Solar Cells (PSCs) are a type of solar cell that uses organic semiconductors. High-efficiency PSCs refer to those that convert a large percentage of the incident sunlight into electrical energy.\n7. visible region: This term refers to the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye, roughly corresponding to wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers.\n8. beneficial: This term implies that the use of PC71BM as the acceptor material is advantageous or desirable for the high-efficiency PSCs due to its stronger absorption in the visible region."
