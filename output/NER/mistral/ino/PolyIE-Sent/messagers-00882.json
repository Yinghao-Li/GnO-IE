The \"thermal stability\" is a property value that describes the copolymers' behavior under heat.\n3. low bandgap: The bandgap is the energy difference between the conduction band and the valence band in a semiconductor material. A low bandgap means that the material can absorb a wider range of photon energies, making it more efficient at photon harvesting. In this context, \"low bandgap\" is a property value that describes the copolymers' ability to absorb a broad spectrum of light."
