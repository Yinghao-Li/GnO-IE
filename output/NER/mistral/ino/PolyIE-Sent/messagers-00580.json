PCZDTB: This is another material name, a derivative of PCZ (Phenyl-carbazole-thiophene) with the suffix \"TB\" having the same meaning as in PQCDTB.\n\n3. Carbazole: This is a material name, a heterocyclic organic compound with a structure resembling indole but with a nitrogen atom replacing one carbon atom.\n\n4. HOMO: This stands for Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital, which is not a material name but a term used in chemistry to describe an electronic state in a molecule or material."
