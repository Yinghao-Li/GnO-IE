In this case, the dihedral angles for PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are different, which is the cause of the observed difference in property.\n\n3. d 010 : This is a property value, likely representing a crystal lattice parameter or interplanar spacing. The difference between the values for PTATDPP and PTAFDPP is mentioned as being accounted for by the difference in their dihedral angles.\n\n4. closely-packed lamellar structure: This is a property value, describing the arrangement of molecules or atoms in a layered structure.
