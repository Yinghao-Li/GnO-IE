In this context, it is not a property value, but rather a reference to a visual representation of data.\n2. XRD patterns: X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are a type of data that is obtained from X-ray diffraction experiments. They represent the intensity of X-rays diffracted at various angles from a crystalline material. XRD patterns are not property values per se, but rather a representation of data that can be used to determine various properties of materials.\n3. Polymer thin films: This refers to a thin layer of polymer material that has been deposited on a substrate. The properties of the polymer thin films could include their thickness, composition, crystallinity, and other physical or chemical properties.\n4. OTS-modified Si/SiO2 substrates: This refers to a substrate that has been modified with organotriethoxysilane (OTS) and consists of silicon (Si) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) layers. The properties of the OTS-modified Si/SiO2 substrates could include their surface energy, roughness, and other physical or chemical properties that affect the deposition and properties of the polymer thin films."
