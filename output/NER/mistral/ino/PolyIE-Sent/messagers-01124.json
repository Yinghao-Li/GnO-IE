Therefore, we cannot identify the material name from this paragraph alone.\n   - CHCl 3: Methylene Chloride\n   - Chlorobenzene: 1,2-Dichlorobenzene or Monochlorobenzene (depending on the position of the chlorine atom)\n   - o-Dichlorobenzene: 1,3-Dichlorobenzene or 1,4-Dichlorobenzene (depending on the position of the chlorine atoms)\n\nSo, the material names in the paragraph are:\n- Methylene Chloride\n- 1,2-Dichlorobenzene or Monochlorobenzene\n- 1,3-Dichlorobenzene or 1,4-Dichlorobenzene."
