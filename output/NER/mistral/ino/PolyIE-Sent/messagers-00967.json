The term \"conjugated polymers\" refers to a class of polymers where the electrons can move freely along the polymer backbone due to the delocalization of pi-electrons. The \"low band-gap\" modification indicates that these polymers have a smaller energy gap between their valence and conduction bands, making them more efficient at absorbing a broader range of the solar spectrum."
