The polymer: This is a type of material made up of repeating subunits, or monomers, linked together by chemical bonds. It is a macroscopic object with various properties.\n4. Closer: This is a relative property that describes the position or proximity of two objects or entities in relation to each other.\n5. The polymer aligned: This is a state or configuration of the polymer where the molecules are arranged in a particular way, likely parallel to each other.\n6. Through π-π stacking: This is a type of intermolecular interaction where the aromatic rings of two molecules are in close proximity and aligned parallel to each other, allowing for the overlapping of their π electrons.\n7. Stronger interchain interactions: This is a property that describes the strength of the forces holding the polymer chains together. It is a measure of the attractive forces between the chains."
