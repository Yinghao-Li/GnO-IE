The property is the LUMO (Luminous Electron Orbital, or Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy level, and the value is -3.12 eV.\n\nSo, the Property Value entities in the paragraph are:\n- LUMO: The property (molecular orbital energy level)\n- -3.12 eV: The value (-3.12 electron volts)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the paragraph does not explicitly state that -3.12 eV is the value of a property for a specific entity, but rather the value of a property for the LUMO of a specific molecular entity (4b). Therefore, the identification of \"Property Value\" entities in this paragraph is somewhat dependent on the context and the understanding of the molecular orbital theory."
