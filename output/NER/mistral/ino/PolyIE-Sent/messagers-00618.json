X-ray diffraction measurement\n\nThe X-ray diffraction measurement is the process used to determine the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal by measuring the diffraction angles and intensities of X-rays that are diffracted by the crystal. It is not a property name itself, but rather a technique used to obtain property information.\n\nHowever, in this context, the X-ray diffraction measurement is providing information about a specific property, which is the presence of a broad diffraction peak. Therefore, we can consider the property being measured as:\n\n2. Broad diffraction peak\n\nA diffraction peak is a characteristic feature in the diffraction pattern of a crystal, which indicates the presence of a specific d-spacing (interplanar distance) in the crystal lattice. The broadness of the peak refers to its width, which can provide information about the size and quality of the crystal."
