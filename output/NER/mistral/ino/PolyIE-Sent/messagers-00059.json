Absorption: This is the process by which a substance takes in another substance. In this context, it refers to the uptake of something by a material.\n5. Decreases: This is a verb that means to become less in amount or value.\n6. Polymer chain: This is a long chain of repeating units, typically made of monomers, that form a large molecule. In this context, it likely refers to the long chains of material that make up a polymer.\n7. Segregation: This is the act of separating or setting apart. In this context, it likely refers to the separation of different parts or components of a material.\n8. High temperature: This is a temperature that is above normal or average. In this context, it likely refers to a temperature that is higher than the normal operating temperature of the material."
