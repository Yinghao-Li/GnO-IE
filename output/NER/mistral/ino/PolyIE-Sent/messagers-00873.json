They represent specific points in the X-ray diffraction pattern that indicate the presence of a crystalline structure.\n3. \"before the samples were annealed\": This is a temporal expression indicating the time when the diffraction peaks were detected.\n4. \"which indicates\": This is a subordinating conjunction introducing a reason or explanation for the following statement.\n5. \"that some degree of crystallinity has been formed\": This is a compound sentence with a subject \"some degree of crystallinity\" and a predicate \"has been formed\". \"Some degree of crystallinity\" is the property value being described, which represents the extent or amount of crystalline structure present in the polymers."
