In this context, it is likely that the specific materials being referred to are the polymers.\n2. Gaps: In the context of materials science, a band gap refers to the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in a solid, which determines the material's ability to conduct electricity.\n3. Polymers: Polymers are large molecules made up of repeating subunits called monomers. They are widely used in various industries due to their versatile properties.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"polymers.\""
