      "content": "1. Absorption spectra: This refers to the way a material absorbs electromagnetic radiation, typically in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible (VIS) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is a property that describes the relationship between the energy of the incident light and the amount of light absorbed as a function of wavelength or frequency.\n2. Thienyl groups: These are aromatic heterocyclic compounds that contain a five-membered ring with one or more sulfur atoms. They are similar to benzene rings but with one or more carbon atoms replaced by sulfur. Thienyl groups can affect the electronic properties of a molecule, including its absorption spectrum.\n3. Density functional theory (DFT): This is a computational quantum mechanical modeling method used to study the electronic structure of many-body systems, such as atoms, molecules, and solids. It is a type of quantum mechanics calculation that provides information about the electronic structure and properties of a system, including its absorption spectrum.\n4. Corresponding model compounds: These are simplified versions of the actual compounds being studied, used for computational analysis. In this context, they are likely to be the same compounds as those mentioned in the paragraph but with thienyl groups instead of the actual groups present in the original compounds. The model compounds are used for DFT calculations to understand the changes in absorption spectra upon the introduction of thienyl groups.\n5. Fig.: This is a reference to a figure or diagram that is likely included in the text but not directly quoted. The figure may show the absorption spectra of the model compounds with and without thienyl groups, allowing for a qualitative comparison.\n\nTherefore, the property values in the paragraph are the absorption spectra of the model compounds with and without thienyl groups."
