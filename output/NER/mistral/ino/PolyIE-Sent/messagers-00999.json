Absorption onsets: These are the wavelengths at which absorption of light begins in the material. They are extended to 770 nm in the solid state.\n3. Vibronic shoulders: These are features in the absorption spectrum that indicate the presence of vibrational modes in the material. They become stronger in the solid state.\n4. Polymer chains: These are the long molecular structures that make up the polymer material. They exhibit a strong tendency to self-assemble in the solid state.\n5. Self-assembly: This is a process by which complex structures form spontaneously from simpler components. In this context, it refers to the tendency of the polymer chains to organize themselves in the solid state.\n6. Crystallization: This is a phase transition in which a material forms a crystalline structure. It may be induced by the self-assembly of the polymer chains in the solid state.\n\nTherefore, the property values in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Absorption onsets: extended to 770 nm\n2.
