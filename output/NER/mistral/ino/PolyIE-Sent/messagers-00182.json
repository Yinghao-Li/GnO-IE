It can include features such as the size and distribution of the domains of each component, the interfacial properties between the domains, and the morphology of the blend as a whole.\n2. Copolymers: Copolymers are polymers that contain more than one type of monomer unit in their structure. In this context, they are likely referring to the specific type of copolymers being used in the blend films.\n3. Fullerene derivatives: Fullerene derivatives are compounds that are derived from fullerenes, which are spherical carbon molecules with a cage-like structure. In this context, they are likely referring to specific derivatives of fullerenes that are being used in the blend films.\n4. Charge transport properties: This refers to the ability of the material to conduct electrical charge. In the context of PSCs (perovskite solar cells), this would refer to the ability of the blend films to transport charge carriers (electrons or holes) efficiently through the material and to the electrodes.\n5. Corresponding efficiencies: This refers to the performance of the PSCs in terms of their ability to convert sunlight into electricity. The efficiency of a solar cell is typically measured as the percentage of incident sunlight that is converted into electrical energy."
