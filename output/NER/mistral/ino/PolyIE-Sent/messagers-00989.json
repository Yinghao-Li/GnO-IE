Low band-gap: This refers to the energy required for an electron to move from the valence band to the conduction band in a material. It is a property of the material.\n3. 1.65 eV: This is the value of the low band-gap for the polymers mentioned in the paragraph.\n4. Deep HOMO energy level: HOMO stands for Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital. It is an energy level in a molecule or material where the highest energy electrons reside. The deep HOMO energy level refers to the energy level being at a lower energy level compared to other materials. It is a property of the material.\n5. -5.45 eV: This is the value of the deep HOMO energy level for the polymers mentioned in the paragraph.\n6. High hole mobility: This refers to the ease with which a hole (a positively charged particle) can move through a material. It is a property of the material.\n7. Ca.: This stands for Curie, a unit of measurement for magnetic field strength. However, in this context, it seems to be used as an abbreviation for \"approximately\" or \"around\", indicating an approximate value for the high hole mobility. Therefore, it is not a Material Name entity."

However, for the sake of clarity, we can consider it as a property of each polymer mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Band-gap: This is a property of semiconducting materials, including polymers. It is the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band.\n3. HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital): This is a molecular orbital property of the polymers. It represents the highest energy level that is occupied by an electron in the ground state.\n4. Energy level: This is a property of molecular orbitals, including HOMO. It is a numerical value that represents the energy level of the orbital.\n5. Deep: This is a descriptive term used to qualify the HOMO energy level. It indicates that the energy level is located at a relatively low energy level compared to other molecular orbitals.\n6. ca. (circa): This is a symbol used to indicate an approximate value. It does not represent a property of the polymers but rather a qualifier for the value of the hole mobility.\n7. High: This is a descriptive term used to qualify the hole mobility. It indicates that the hole mobility is relatively large or fast.\n8. Hole mobility: This is a property of semiconducting materials, including polymers. It is a measure of how easily holes (positive charge carriers) can move through the material."
