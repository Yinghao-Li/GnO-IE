Decent hole mobilities of both copolymers: This refers to the ability of the copolymers to conduct holes effectively. \"Decent\" is an adjective modifying \"mobilities,\" which is a physical property that describes how easily charge carriers (in this case, holes) can move through a material. \"Both copolymers\" is a noun phrase indicating two specific copolymers under discussion.\n\n2. High crystallinity of the copolymers: \"High crystallinity\" is a property that describes the degree of orderliness in the arrangement of the molecules in the copolymers. It is a quantifiable measure of the solid-state structure of the material.\n\n3. Highly coplanar structure of anthracene and DPP: \"Highly coplanar structure\" is a property that describes the degree to which the planes of the anthracene and DPP molecules lie flat and parallel to each other. This property can influence the crystallinity and charge transport properties of the copolymers.\n\nAnthracene and DPP are specific chemical compounds mentioned in the paragraph. They are not properties, but they do have properties that are relevant to the discussion."
