It is typically measured in A/cm² or mA/cm².\n2. EQE: The abbreviation EQE stands for External Quantum Efficiency. It is a measure of the efficiency of a photovoltaic device in converting light energy into electrical energy before accounting for losses in the electrical system. It is typically expressed as a percentage.\n3. AM 1.5G: AM 1.5G is a standard reference spectrum used in photovoltaics to measure the performance of solar cells. It represents the spectral distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface at an angle of incidence of 45 degrees under standard test conditions.\n4. J-V measurements: J-V measurements refer to the measurement of the current-voltage characteristics of a photovoltaic device. These measurements provide important information about the performance of the device, including its open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Isc), and maximum power output (Pmax)."
