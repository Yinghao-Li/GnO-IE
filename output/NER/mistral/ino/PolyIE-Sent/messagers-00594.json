However, since we are asked to identify \"Property Name\" entities, let's assume they are properties of certain resistances and leave their exact nature undefined for now.\n\n2. series resistance: This is a property or characteristic of electrical circuits. It can be considered as a \"Property Name\" entity.\n\n3. at PQCDTB and PC71BM: This phrase indicates that the series resistance is associated with or measured for the PQCDTB and PC71BM materials/devices. It does not have a clear meaning as a standalone term and can be considered as a modifier or descriptive phrase rather than a property name.\n\n4. ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 : These are mathematical expressions representing the ratio of two quantities. They do not have a clear meaning as standalone property names and can be considered as modifiers or descriptive phrases.\n\n5. 31 and 27 Ω / cm^2 : These are numerical values representing the series resistance for the PQCDTB and PC71BM materials/devices, respectively. They do not have a clear meaning as standalone property names and can be considered as values or measurements associated with the property \"series resistance\".\n\nIn summary, the \"Property Name\" entities in the paragraph are \"series resistance\" and \"ratios\" (in a broader sense, as they describe a property or relationship between quantities). The other entities mentioned in the paragraph are either specific materials/devices (PQCDTB and PC71BM), descriptive phrases (at PQCDTB and PC71BM, of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2), or numerical values (31 and 27 Ω / cm^2)."
