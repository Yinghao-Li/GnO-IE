Strong electron-withdrawing: This is a property of the DPP segments, indicating their ability to withdraw electrons from other molecules or atoms.\n4. DPP in PBDTT-DPP25-TPD75 and PBDTT-DPP10-TPD90: These are specific instances of the DPP property, referring to the DPP segments in each of the given polymers.\n5. Trap sites: These are defects or impurities in a material that can capture charge carriers, preventing them from moving freely through the material. They are not property values, but rather a type of defect or feature.\n6. Which suppress efficient charge transfer: This is a descriptive statement about the effect of the trap sites on the charge transfer process. It is not a property value.\n\nTherefore, the property values in the paragraph are the strong electron-withdrawing property of the DPP segments."
