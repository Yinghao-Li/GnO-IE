The abbreviation IDT likely stands for \"Interdigitated Thin Film Transistor,\" but without more context, it could also refer to other acronyms. Therefore, a more specific name for these materials would be helpful for a complete identification.\n2. deep HOMO levels: HOMO stands for \"Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital.\" It is a property of materials, specifically organic semiconductors, which describes the energy level of the last electron that can be removed from the material. In this context, \"deep\" refers to a low energy level.\n3. resulted devices: The devices that have been fabricated using the IDT-based polymers. The type of devices is not specified in the paragraph.\n4. V oc: Voltage offset or voltage bias is a term used in electronics to describe the difference in voltage between two points in a circuit. In the context of the paragraph, it likely refers to the voltage offset in the organic electronic devices fabricated using the IDT-based polymers."
