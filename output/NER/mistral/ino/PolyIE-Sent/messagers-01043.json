This is a structural property.\n2. weak electron - donating nature: This is a descriptive term for the ability of the TA unit to donate electrons easily. This is a chemical property.\n3. relatively low band - gap: This refers to the energy difference between the valence band (where electrons are normally found) and the conduction band (where electrons can move freely) in the copolymer. A low band gap means that it is easier for electrons to move between the valence and conduction bands, making the material more conductive. This is a physical property.\n4. low - lying HOMO energy level: HOMO stands for Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital. It is the energy level of the last electron to be added to a molecule. A low-lying HOMO energy level means that it is easier for electrons to be excited to this level, making the material more reactive. This is a chemical property.\n5. high crystallinity: This refers to the degree of orderliness in the arrangement of atoms in the copolymer. A high crystallinity means that the atoms are arranged in a regular and repeating pattern, which can lead to better material properties such as improved mechanical strength and electrical conductivity. This is a structural property.\n6. efficient charge transporting characteristics: This refers to the ability of the copolymer to move charges (electrons or ions) through it quickly and easily. This is a physical property."
