Absorption peaks can be considered a property, but they are more specifically a property related to the absorption spectrum of the material. The number of thienyl spacers is a structural feature that affects the material's properties, but it is not a property itself. Absorption coefficients, on the other hand, are a material property that can be directly controlled by tailoring the number of thienyl spacers."
