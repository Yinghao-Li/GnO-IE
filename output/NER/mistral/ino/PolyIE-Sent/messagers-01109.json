However, it's important to note that without additional context, it's impossible to definitively determine if these entities are properties or not. For example, \"upper limit\" and \"wavelengths below 650 nm\" could be properties of a material or a process, while \"this material combination,\" \"P3HT,\" and \"solar spectrum\" are more likely to be entities.
