Bridged dithiophene: A specific type of dithiophene with a bridge connecting the two sulfur atoms.\n2. Dithiophene: A chemical compound with two thiophene rings connected by a single bond.\n3. Planar structure: Not a material itself, but a structural property of the material (bridged dithiophene) when it adopts a flat, two-dimensional arrangement.\n4. Highly-conjugated copolymers: Materials made of copolymers with a highly conjugated backbone, which allows for efficient electron transfer."
