The next entities mentioned are \"aromatic core\" and \"imide groups.\" These are the material names or types of functional groups in this context. An aromatic core refers to a structure of unsaturated hydrocarbons, while imide is a functional group consisting of a carbonyl group (-C=O) linked to a nitrogen atom (-N=) through a carbon atom. In this context, the imide groups are likely attached to the aromatic core."
