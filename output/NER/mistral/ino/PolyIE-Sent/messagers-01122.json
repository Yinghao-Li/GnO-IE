It is typically expressed in units of amperes per square centimeter (A/cm^2). Therefore, the material name is not explicitly mentioned in this phrase, but it can be inferred that it refers to the μmR-polymers since the advance was achieved for them.\n2. PCE: This stands for Power Conversion Efficiency. It is a measure of how effectively a material can convert solar energy into electrical energy. The value given is 2.71%. Again, the material name is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that it refers to the μmR-polymers.\n\nSo, the material names in the paragraph are \"μmR-polymers\"."
