It is not a material, but it is often associated with certain materials in electrical contexts, such as capacitors. However, in this context, it is a variable, so it is not a Material Name.\n4. i: This is a variable representing current. It is not a material, so it is not a Material Name.\n5. μ: This is a variable representing the mobility of charge carriers. It is not a material, so it is not a Material Name.\n6. V: This is a variable representing voltage. It is not a material, so it is not a Material Name.\n7. G: This is a variable representing the conductance of a material. It is a property of materials, but it is not a specific material name.\n8. V T : This is a variable representing the threshold voltage. It is not a material, so it is not a Material Name.\n9.
