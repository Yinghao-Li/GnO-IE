In this context, P6 is the property of being a homopolymer.\n2. Copolymers P1-P5: These are polymers that consist of more than one type of monomer unit. In this context, P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 are the properties of being copolymers.\n3. Red-shifted absorptions: This is a property related to the absorption spectrum of the polymers. The term \"red-shifted\" refers to a shift in the absorption spectrum towards longer wavelengths (redder colors).\n4. Smaller optical bandgaps: This is another property related to the absorption spectrum of the polymers. The optical bandgap is the energy required to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. A smaller bandgap means that less energy is required for this transition to occur, which can result in various optical and electrical properties."
