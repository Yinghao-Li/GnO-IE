It appears to be experiencing some form of degradation due to larger phase aggregation.\n\n2. PC71BM: This is another material, likely a fullerene derivative, that is blended with PzNDTDTBT in the production of Perovskite Solar Cells. It is also mentioned as contributing to the larger phase aggregation and subsequent degradation of PzNDTDTBT.\n\n3. Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs): These are a type of solar cell technology that utilizes a perovskite-structured compound as the light-harvesting material. The performance of these cells is affected by the degradation of PzNDTDTBT and PC71BM.\n\n4. Negative effect: This term refers to the detrimental impact that the larger phase aggregation has on the PSCs, leading to a decrease in their photovoltaic performance."
