Intramolecular charge transfer band: This refers to a specific type of electronic transition within a single molecule, where an electron is transferred from one part of the molecule to another, leading to a charge transfer band in the absorption spectrum. The material involved in this process is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it is the material exhibiting the intramolecular charge transfer band.\n3.

It is the material in which the interchain stacking aggregation occurs and leads to the long-wavelength absorption at around 680 nm."
