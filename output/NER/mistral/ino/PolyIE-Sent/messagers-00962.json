The property values related to this compound could be its molecular weight, melting point, boiling point, etc.\n3. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP): This is another specific organic compound, a diketopyrrolopyrrole. It is an electron-withdrawing unit, meaning it can withdraw electrons from other molecules. The property values related to this compound could be its molecular weight, melting point, boiling point, etc.\n4. Electron-donating unit: This is a property of the 9,10-thienyl-substituted anthracene (TA) compound, as it is described as an electron-donating unit in the context of the copolymer.\n5. Electron-withdrawing unit: This is a property of the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) compound, as it is described as an electron-withdrawing unit in the context of the copolymer.\n6.
