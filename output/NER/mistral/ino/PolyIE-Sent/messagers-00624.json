The term \"aromatic imides\" is the property name in this context, as it describes a specific class of compounds characterized by the presence of an imide functional group in an aromatic ring.\n2. Rylene diimides: This is a specific type of aromatic imide. It is a named compound, but the \"diimides\" part can be considered a property name, as it describes a particular structural feature of this specific type of aromatic imide.\n3. n-type building blocks: This is a property name, as it describes a particular type of semiconductor material that conducts electricity by transporting negatively charged electrons.\n4. High electron affinities: This is a property name, as it describes the ability of a substance to attract electrons.\n5. High electron mobilities: This is a property name, as it describes the ease with which electrons can move through a material.\n6. Excellent chemical, thermal, and photochemical stabilities: These are property names, as they describe various types of stability that the materials exhibit. \"Chemical stability\" refers to resistance to chemical reactions, \"thermal stability\" refers to resistance to heat, and \"photochemical stability\" refers to resistance to light-induced reactions."
