It is not a property value, but rather a computational method used to determine property values.\n2. Molecular and electronic properties: These are the properties of the PffBB-n polymer that are being studied using DFT calculations. They can include various physical and chemical characteristics such as molecular geometry, electronic structure, energy levels, and charge distributions.\n3. B3LYP / 6-311+(d,p): This is the specific DFT method and basis set used in the calculations. The B3LYP method is a type of density functional theory, and 6-311+(d,p) is a particular basis set. These choices can affect the accuracy of the calculated property values.\n4. Vacuum: This refers to the environment in which the calculations are being performed. In this case, it means that no external atoms or molecules are present around the PffBB-n polymer during the calculations.\n5. Repeating conjugated units of the polymer backbone: These are specific parts of the PffBB-n polymer that are being studied in the calculations. They are the repeating units of the polymer's backbone, which are the parts of the molecule that contain the conjugated system of electrons.\n6. All of the alkyl substitutions were replaced by ethyl groups: This modification to the repeating units of the polymer backbone is done to reduce the calculation time. Ethyl groups are smaller than the original alkyl substituents, so they require fewer computational resources to model. Therefore, this change is a way to make the calculations more efficient, but it may also affect the accuracy of the calculated property values."
