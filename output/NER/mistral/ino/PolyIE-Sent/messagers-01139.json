Photovoltaic polymers\n\nThe term \"photovoltaic polymers\" refers to a class of materials used in photovoltaics, which are devices that convert light energy into electrical energy. These polymers are organic materials and are known for their electrical conductivity and ability to generate an electric field when exposed to light. Therefore, \"photovoltaic polymers\" can be considered a Material Name entity."
