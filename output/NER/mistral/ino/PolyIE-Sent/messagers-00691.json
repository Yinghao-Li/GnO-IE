Open circuit voltage (Voc): This is a property of a material or a device, specifically a photovoltaic cell or solar panel, which refers to the voltage at which no current flows through the circuit when the solar cells are not supplying power and are exposed to sunlight.\n2. Short-circuit current density (Jsc): This is a property of a material or a device, specifically a photovoltaic cell or solar panel, which refers to the maximum current density that can be produced when the solar cells are short-circuited and under illumination.\n3. Fill factor (FF): This is a property of a material or a device, specifically a photovoltaic cell or solar panel, which is a measure of the efficiency of the device at converting solar energy into electrical energy at the maximum power point.\n4. Preliminary power conversion efficiency (PCE): This is a property of a material or a device, specifically a photovoltaic cell or solar panel, which refers to the percentage of the incident solar energy that is converted into electrical energy by the device.\n\nSo, the Material Names in the paragraph are:\n1. Photovoltaic cell or solar panel\n2. Solar light."
