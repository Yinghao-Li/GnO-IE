The difference between the two is due to the presence of PC71BM or PC61BM as a material. Therefore, PC71BM and PC61BM are the Material Name entities in the paragraph. The first two entities are compounds that consist of PBDT-TDPP-S and either PC71BM or PC61BM."

Therefore, PC71BM and PC61BM are the only Material Name entities in the paragraph that are directly relevant to the discussion. The first two entities mentioned in the paragraph (PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM and PBDT-TDPP-S:PC61BM) are compounds that consist of PBDT-TDPP-S and either PC71BM or PC61BM, respectively. However, since the focus of the question is to identify Material Name entities, we can ignore the compound names and only keep the material names (PC71BM and PC61BM)."
