Film interconnectivity: This refers to the degree of connection or interaction between different parts of the film. Better interconnectivity can lead to improved properties such as conductivity.\n4. Charge transport: This is the movement of electric charges through a material. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the movement of charges in the films.\n5. Mobility: This is a measure of how easily charges can move through a material. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the mobility of charges in the films."
