PffBB-10 is a specific type of device mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. α value is a property or parameter that indicates the degree of bimolecular recombination loss in the device.\n3. Bimolecular recombination loss is a property or phenomenon that refers to the recombination of electrons and holes in the device, leading to a decrease in the electrical performance.\n4. BHJ film stands for Blend of High and Low Bandgap materials Heterojunction film, which is a type of thin film used in organic photovoltaic devices."
