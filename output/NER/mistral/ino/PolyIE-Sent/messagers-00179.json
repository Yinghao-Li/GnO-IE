However, in this context, it is not a material itself but rather a method used to study materials.\n\nThe other two entities are \"polymers\" and \"conjugated polymers.\" Polymers are a broad class of materials made up of long chains of repeating units called monomers. Conjugated polymers are a specific type of polymer where the electrons can move freely along the polymer backbone due to the delocalization of electrons in the pi bonds between the repeating units."
