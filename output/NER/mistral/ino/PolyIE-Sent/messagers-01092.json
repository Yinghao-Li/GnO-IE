PBDT-TDPP-S is a polymer:conjugated small molecule blend, and PC71BM is a specific small molecule.\n2. J-V characteristics: This refers to the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of a device, which is a measure of the relationship between the voltage applied to a device and the resulting current flowing through it.\n3. Charge carrier mobility: This is a material property that describes how easily charge carriers (electrons or holes) can move through a material. In this context, it refers to the charge carrier mobility of the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM blend.\n4. Room temperature: This is a environmental condition, specifically the temperature at which the measurements were taken.\n5. Space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model: This is a theoretical model used to extract the charge carrier mobility from the J-V characteristics of a device under the assumption that the current is limited by the presence of space charge.\n\nSo, the identified property names in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
