It is a numerical value with units, so it is not a Material Name entity on its own, but it describes the value of the hole mobility for the specific material containing BTT.\n3. polymer: This is a type of material, specifically an organic material made up of long chains of repeating units. In this context, it is the material that contains BTT and exhibits the reported hole mobility and PCE. Therefore, \"polymer\" is a Material Name entity.\n4. benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-d′]trithiophene (BTT): This is a specific type of organic compound, a trithiophene derivative, which is the material component that contributes to the effective intermolecular packing characteristics and the reported hole mobility and PCE in the polymer. Therefore, \"benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-d′]trithiophene (BTT)\" is a Material Name entity."
