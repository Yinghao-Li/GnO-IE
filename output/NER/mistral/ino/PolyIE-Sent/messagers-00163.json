Three dithienopyrrole - based donor - acceptor type copolymers: These are the polymers being synthesized in the Scheme 1 Synthetic route. The term \"copolymers\" indicates that they are made up of more than one type of monomer. The \"donor - acceptor type\" suggests that they have alternating segments that can donate and accept electrons. The \"dithienopyrrole - based\" part indicates that the copolymers are derived from dithienopyrrole monomers.\n\nTherefore, the \"Material Name\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
