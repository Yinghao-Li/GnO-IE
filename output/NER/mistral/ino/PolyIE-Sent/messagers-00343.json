Structural state of PCDTBT thin films: This property value is also mentioned in the paragraph, but it is described as \"amorphous,\" which implies that the films do not have a crystalline structure. This information is relevant to understanding the property value of mobilities, as the lack of a crystalline structure may affect the mobility of charge carriers. Therefore, both \"PCDTBT thin films\" and \"amorphous\" are relevant property values."
