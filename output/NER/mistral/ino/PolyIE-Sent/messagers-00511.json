It is not a material, but rather a property or performance metric of the optimized devices based on P1.\n2. P1: It is a material or semiconductor used in the optimized devices.\n3. V oc : It stands for Open Circuit Voltage, which is a property of a photovoltaic cell or solar cell, measured under illumination but with no load connected. It is not a material, but rather a characteristic of the optimized devices based on P1.\n4. V oc (0.97 V): The specific value (0.97 V) is the open circuit voltage of the optimized devices based on P1.\n5. J sc : It stands for Short Circuit Current Density, which is the maximum current density that a photovoltaic cell can deliver under short circuit conditions. It is a property of the optimized devices based on P1.\n6. J sc (6.7 mA / cm^2): The specific value (6.7 mA / cm^2) is the short circuit current density of the optimized devices based on P1.\n7. FF: It stands for Fill Factor, which is a dimensionless quantity used to describe the efficiency of a solar cell to convert the incident light into electricity. It is a property of the optimized devices based on P1.\n8. FF (0.47): The specific value (0.47) is the fill factor of the optimized devices based on P1.\n\nTherefore, the material names in the paragraph are P1."
