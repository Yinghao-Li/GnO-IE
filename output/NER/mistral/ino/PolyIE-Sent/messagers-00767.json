The paragraph is describing a tendency observed in two sets of data: (BDTT - DPP) 3 and (BDTT - TPD) 3.\n2. To identify potential property values, we need to understand what each abbreviation represents. Let's assume the following meanings based on context:\n   - BDTT: Before Disaster Total Damage\n   - DPP: Disaster Preparedness Program\n   - TPD: Total Property Damage\n3. Based on the given abbreviations, it seems that the paragraph is comparing the difference between the total damage before a disaster (BDTT) and the total property damage (TPD) in two scenarios: one with a Disaster Preparedness Program (DPP) and one without it (no explicit mention of the absence of a program in the second scenario).\n4. Therefore, the potential property values that could be identified from this paragraph are:\n   - Before Disaster Total Damage (BDTT) in the presence of a Disaster Preparedness Program (DPP)\n   - Total Property Damage (TPD) in the presence of a Disaster Preparedness Program (DPP)\n   - Before Disaster Total Damage (BDTT) in the absence of a Disaster Preparedness Program (no explicit mention)\n   - Total Property Damage (TPD) in the absence of a Disaster Preparedness Program (no explicit mention)\n5. However, the paragraph does not provide specific values for these properties. It only mentions that there is a tendency observed in the differences between these values in the two scenarios."
