Narrow: This is a descriptive term for the optical band gap, but it does not directly refer to a material property. However, it can be considered an attribute of the material property \"optical band gap\".\n4. Optical band gap: This is a material property that refers to the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in a material, which determines the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that the material can absorb. In this context, it is described as \"narrow\", indicating a small band gap."
