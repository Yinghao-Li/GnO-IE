It is a copolymer with the main component being anthracene, which is substituted with two 5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl groups. Thiophen is a heterocyclic compound, and ethylhexyl is a hydrocarbon chain. Therefore, TA is a copolymer containing anthracene as the electron-withdrawing unit and 5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl as the electron-donating unit."
