As reported by Lidzey et al. , the PCZDTB oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potential were + 1.09 and -1.37 V , respectively , and the HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.44 and -2.98 eV. In the case of PQCDTB , unlike the PQA2T ( poly[quinacridone-bithiophene] ) reported by Takimiya et al. , a clear oxidation - reduction peak was observed. 19 This type of result has been obtained because PQCDTB was D-A structured , unlike the typical p - type structure of PQA2T. In PQCDTB , the oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potentials were + 0.89 and -1.36 V , respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.24 and -2.99 eV , respectively. Table 2 summarizes the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers. As shown in Table 2 , the HOMO level of PQCDTB ( -5.24 eV ) was higher than that of PCZDTB by 0.2 eV because the HOMO level of the QC derivative was higher than that of carbazole.
