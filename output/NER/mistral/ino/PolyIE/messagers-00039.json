The transport properties of the polymer were investigated by fabricating organic thin film fieldeffect transistors ( OFETs ). Typical p-channel field - effect transistor behavior was obtained. The hole mobility ( μ ) was estimated in the saturated regime from the derivative plots of the square root of source - drain current ( I SD ) versus gate voltage ( V G ) through equation 2 where W is the channel width , L is the channel length , C i is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer ( SiO 2 , 500 nm , C i = 7.5 nF / cm^2 ) , and V T is the threshold voltage.
