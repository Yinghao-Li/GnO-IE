Photovoltaic Performance Measurements. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using polymer : PC 70 BM blend films. The polymer : PC 70 BM blends were dissolved in a mixed solvent containing chlorobenzene ( CB ) and 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) in a volume ratio of 97 : 3. The solutions were spincoated onto PEDOT : PSS - coated ITO substrates. A thin TiO 2 nanoparticle layer was then spin - coated onto the blend film , followed by aluminum evaporation. Devices prepared using either polymer showed the best performances for a polymer : PC 70 BM blend ratio of 1 : 2. The solar cell properties were measured under AM1.5G illumination , and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The current density - voltage curves are shown in Figure 4a. POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices displayed reasonable open - circuit voltages ( V oc ) of 0.70 and 0.72 V , respectively , considering their HOMO levels , -5.23 and -5.37 eV , respectively. The POBDTPD device exhibited a short - circuit current ( J sc ) of 10.6 mA cm^-2 , whereas the PEBDTPD device showed a J sc of 13.5 mA cm^-2 . The fill factor ( FF ) values were 0.64 and 0.54 for the POBDTPD and the PEBDTPD devices , respectively. As a result , the PCEs were 4.7% and 5.3% for the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices , respectively. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra were also measured ( Figure 4b ). A high EQE response of greater than 50% over the range 400- 550 nm was observed for both polymer devices. The EQEs were higher for the PEBDTPD device in the 550-900 nm range , partly because the PEBDTPD polymer has a higher light absorption at long wavelengths ( Figure 1a ) , which is consistent with the higher J sc values in the PEBDTPD device. To understand the reasons of the higher J sc and the lower FF in the PEBDTPD device , as compared with the POBDTPD device more specifically , we investigated film morphology , exciton separation , and carrier mobility in the polymer films and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films. First , film morphology was Figure 6 shows the PL spectra of the polymers and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films spin - coated from CB solutions or CB solutions containing 3 vol % DIO additives. Both the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers displayed PL with a peak around 990 nm. Blending polymers with PC 70 BMs , especially with an aid of the DIO additive , significantly quenched PL. This effective PL quenching suggested that the exciton separation was highly efficient in both the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
