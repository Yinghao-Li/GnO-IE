The combination of the different electron - deficient units of pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) and thieno [ 3,4- c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) can be ideal for producing broad light absorption due to the large difference between their electron - withdrawing strengths. 19,22 In addition , both units have been successfully used in D-A copolymers to produce high - performance PSCs. 26-33 While electron - withdrawing TPD possesses a relatively simple , symmetric , and planar structure suitable for D-A copolymers in PSCs , DPP exhibits very strong electron - withdrawing effect due to the presence of electrondeficient lactam rings and strong π-π interactions. 19,34 Herein , we report a series of novel random poly[thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione]copolymers ( PBDTT- DPP - TPD ) based on one electron - rich unit , thienylsubstituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDTT ) , and two electron - deficient units , DPP and TPD , that have complementary and broad light absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm.
