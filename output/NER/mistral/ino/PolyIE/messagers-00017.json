However , good acceptor moieties enabling polymers to absorb wavelengths over 800 nm remain still rare though acceptor moieties strongly affected to produce a narrow band gap. 37-40 In search of new acceptor moieties , we designed an interesting structure of N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5-azacyclopenta[a]-pentalene-4,6-dione ( DTPD ). The DTPD is a structural combination of thieno [3,4-b]thiophene and N-alkylpyrrole-2,5-dione. The thieno [3,4-b]thiophene is a particularly suitable structure to promote quinoid structures in conjugated polymers. 41-44 However , simple incorporation of the thieno- [3,4-b]thiophene units might increase the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) level of polymers , which causes a significant loss of open - circuit voltages in PSCs. 42 Thus , it is desirable to attach electron - withdrawing groups such as ketone or ester groups and fluorine atoms. 12,15,30 Here we glued the Nalkylpyrrole-2,5-dione , a strong electron - withdrawing unit , 45 to the thieno [3,4-b]thiophene to bring down the HOMO level. Our DFT calculations , indeed , suggested that the DTPD would be a strong electron - withdrawing acceptor moiety ( Figure S1 ). 26,45 Therefore , each fractional unit in the DTPD may exert a synergetic effect to permit strong donor - acceptor electronic delocalization by the quinoid structure and to locate HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) levels of resulting low band gap polymers in a deep state when the DTPD is copolymerized with an appropriate donor moiety. Despite these promising features , to the best of our knowledge , the DTPD moiety has never been utilized to synthesize low band gap polymers for PSCs. Herein , we report synthesis and characterization of two polymers , POBDTPD and PEBDTPD , that consist of DTPD and BDT moieties substituted with octyloxy or 2-ethylhexyloxy g r o u p s , r e s p e c t i v e l y . P O B D T P D : P C 7^0 B M a n d PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blends utilized light absorption up to 900 nm in the generation of photocurrents and showed optimal morphology and efficient exciton separation , yielding PCEs exceeding 5% . This work demonstrates that the newly designed DTPD moiety is a promising building block for high performance PSCs .
