In the device that blended the PQCDTB and PC71BM in a 1 : 1 ratio , V OC , J SC , and FF were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , and 55.8% , respectively. In terms of PCE , approximately 56% was improved with 2.5% , compared with the device in which the PC61BM was applied as an acceptor. Because PC71BM is greater than PC61BM in terms of photon absorption at 400-500 nm , it was able to improve the PCE by increasing J SC . 6 The V oc of PQCDTB was greater than the widely known poly(3-hexylthiophene) , P3HT ( V oc = 0.5 - 0.6 V ). This type of result was obtained because PQCDTB ( -5.53 eV ) has a lower HOMO level than P3HT ( -4.9 eV ). 19,24 The value of FF for PQCDTB ( FF = 55.8% ) increased by 39% compared to PCZDTB ( FF = 40.1% ). The series resistance at PQCDTB and PC71BM ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 , as shown in Table 3 , was 31 and 27 Ω / cm^2 , respectively. In contrast , the series resistance at PCZDTB and PC71BM ratio of 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 was 320 , 62 Ω / cm^2 , respectively. The series resistance of PQCDTB exhibited low value compared to that of PCZDTB. The decrease of series resistance could increase FF. PQCDTB showed high FF than PCZDTB due to decrease of series resistance by self - organization of quinacridone unit. 9 Figure 5b showed the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) data of the fabricated device. When PQCDTB was used as a donor and PC61BM and PC71BM were used as acceptors , the device had 38% and 41% EQE at 480 nm , respectively. The photovoltaic devices with PC71BM as an acceptor showed higher EQE values than those with PC61BM as an acceptor , although they absorbed photons in the same range of the solar spectra. This was because PC71BM has a stronger UV - vis absorption property than does PC61BM in the visible region , especially near 500 nm. 30 Hence , the PCE improved with an increase in J SC . In a device that used PCZDTB as a donor , an EQE of 48% was observed at 440 nm. Interestingly , λ max was blue - shifted by -30 nm because of the low π-π stacking and the weak intermolecular interaction of PCZDTB compared with PQCDTB.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
