In the case of polymers , extremely limited results have been reported. 21,22 In the Takimiya group , recently , a polymer composed of QC derivatives has been reported for use in OTFTs that has a high hole mobility ( 0.2 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ). 23 In this study , we synthesized a new donor - acceptor type ( D- A type ) polymer , poly[quinacridone-alt-octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole] ( PQCDTB ) , which contained QC and octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole ( DTB ).
