Using PBDT-TDPP-S as electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as electron acceptor , the resulting polymer solar cells exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a power conversion efficiency of 4.89% , an open - circuit voltage of 0.84 V , a short - circuit current of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor of 56.0% .
