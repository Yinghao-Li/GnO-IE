Here, we can consider \"OFETs based on a phthalimide - containing polythiophene\" as a single material property entity.\n* \"hole mobilities\" is a material property.\n* \"∼ 0.2 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1\" is a specific value of the material property \"hole mobilities\".\n* \"under ambient conditions\" and \"without optimization\" are experimental conditions that can influence material properties, but they are not material properties themselves.
