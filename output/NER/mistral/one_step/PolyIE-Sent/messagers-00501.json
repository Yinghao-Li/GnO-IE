The properties mentioned in the paragraph that can be considered material properties are capacitance (C) and carrier mobility (μ). The other mentioned properties, such as power (W), length (L), current (I), voltage (V), and generated voltage (V\\_G), are not material properties but rather physical quantities that can be associated with a material when it is used in a specific context, such as a photovoltaic cell."
