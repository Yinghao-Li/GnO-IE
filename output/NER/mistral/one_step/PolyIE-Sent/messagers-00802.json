Therefore, HOMO and LUMO are valid entities in this context. However, if the focus is only on material properties that can be measured or quantified independently of the specific molecular structure, then \"energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)\" and \"energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)\" could be considered as redundant and less precise than just \"HOMO energy level\" and \"LUMO energy level\", respectively. In that case, the table could be updated accordingly."
