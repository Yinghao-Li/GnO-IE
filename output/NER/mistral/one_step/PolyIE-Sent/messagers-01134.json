However, for clarity, I have presented them as separate entities in the table. Similarly, \"HOMO levels\" and \"LUMO levels\" are also a single property with two values, but I have presented them as separate entities for the same reason. Additionally, I have added \"oxidation potential\" and \"reduction potential\" as they are the properties from which the HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated."
