However, since the previous row mentions \"performance of PSFDTBT-based polymer solar cells\", it can be inferred that the property value being referred to is the performance of the solar cells. Therefore, the table only includes \"performance of PSFDTBT-based polymer solar cells\" and \"device fabrication conditions\" as property values."
