Optical band gap energies: The paragraph states that \"Optical band gap energies show little change with by changing perylene unit ratios\". Here, \"Optical band gap energies\" is the property value.\n2. Perylene unit ratios: The same sentence also mentions \"changing perylene unit ratios\". Therefore, \"perylene unit ratios\" is another property value.\n3.

Here, \"HOMO energy levels\" is the property value.\n4. Position of HOMO energy levels: The sentence also mentions that \"the HOMO energy levels were moved toward higher positions\". Therefore, \"position of HOMO energy levels\" is another property value.\n\nNote: HOMO stands for Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital."
