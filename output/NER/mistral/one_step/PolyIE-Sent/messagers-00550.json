PQCDTB and PCZDTB are the names of the specific materials mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. QC is mentioned as a part of PQCDTB and PCZDTB, but it is not explicitly stated as a separate material. However, since it is an essential component of the material names, it should be included in the list.\n3. Carbazole is mentioned as a part of the structure that contributes to the high thermal stability of the materials. It is not explicitly stated as a separate material, but it is a significant entity in the context of the paragraph."

In the revised version of the answer, I have removed \"QC\" and \"carbazole\" as they are not material names in the context of the paragraph. \"QC\" is mentioned as a component of PQCDTB and PCZDTB, and \"carbazole\" is mentioned as a part of the structure that contributes to the high thermal stability of the materials. However, neither of them is explicitly stated as separate material names. Therefore, they should not be included in the list of material names."
