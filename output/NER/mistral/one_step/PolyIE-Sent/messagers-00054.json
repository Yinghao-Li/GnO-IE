These are the different forms or variants of the material PffBB. Therefore, they are valid material names. The other mentioned entities, such as \"UV-vis absorption spectra\", \"chlorobenzene\", \"different temperatures\", and \"thin films\", do not clearly refer to material names and should be excluded from the table."
