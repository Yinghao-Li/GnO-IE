However, the paragraph only mentions that the absorption band of \"P3\" and \"P4\" is narrow and blue-shifted compared to \"P1\" and \"P2\", so there is no additional descriptive information provided for \"P1\" and \"P2\" that clearly refers to their material properties. Therefore, they are not included in the final table.]"
