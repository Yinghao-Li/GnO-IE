The entities identified in the previous answer, \"mobility decrease in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film,\" \"less uniform morphology,\" and \"more aggregated morphology,\" all refer to material properties of the blend film. Therefore, they are valid entities for this question.\n\nEntities that do not clearly refer to material properties include \"considerable mobility decrease,\" \"POBDTPD,\" \"PC 70 BM,\" and \"aforementioned.\" While \"considerable\" and \"aforementioned\" could potentially be considered adjectives modifying the material properties, they do not add specific information about the properties themselves and can be removed without loss of meaning. \"POBDTPD\" and \"PC 70 BM\" are abbreviations for specific materials or blends, but they do not provide information about the material properties being discussed. Therefore, they are not valid entities for this question."
