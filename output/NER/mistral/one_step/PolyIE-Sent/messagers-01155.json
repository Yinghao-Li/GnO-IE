The smaller the LUMO offset, the easier it is for electrons to move from the polymer to PCBM (Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester), leading to better charge transfer and potentially better performance in organic solar cells. The mixing morphology refers to the distribution and intermingling of the two materials (polymer and PCBM) at the nanoscale level, which can affect the efficiency of charge transfer and thus the overall performance of the solar cell."
