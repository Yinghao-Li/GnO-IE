Similarly, \"active layer\" is a contextual term used to describe where the properties are being measured.\n\nThe entities \"PCs\" and \"solar cells\" are types of materials, specifically polymer solar cells. Therefore, \"polymer solar cells (PSCs)\" is included in the table as a property, as it refers to a specific type of material property.\n\nThe entities \"mobilities of space charge - limited current (SCLC)\" and \"mobilities\" are related to a material property, specifically the mobility of charge carriers in a material under specific conditions. Therefore, they are included in the table.\n\nThe entities \"surface morphology\" and \"morphology\" refer to the physical structure and shape of a material at the surface level, which is a material property. Therefore, they are included in the table.\n\nThe entities \"UV - vis absorption\", \"cyclic voltammetry (CV)\", and \"organic field - effect transistors (OFETs)\" are all techniques used to measure material properties, specifically the absorption spectrum, redox properties, and electrical conductivity, respectively. Therefore, they are not material properties themselves, but rather methods used to characterize material properties. However, they are included in the table for completeness, as they are mentioned in the context of characterizing the properties of PCDSeBT.\n\nThe entity \"[6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)\" is a specific material used in the BHJ active layer of the PSCs. It is included in the table as a property, as it is a material that is being evaluated along with the other properties of the PCDSeBT material."
