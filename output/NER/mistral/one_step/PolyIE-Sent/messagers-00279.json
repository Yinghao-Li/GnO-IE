The original values are nearly identical, but after the blend films are formed, the hole mobility in PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film decreases only slightly, while the hole mobility in POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film decreases significantly. Therefore, we can identify the following property names:\n\n1. hole mobility in PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film\n2. hole mobility in POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film\n3. hole mobility in PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film (after decrease)\n4. hole mobility in POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film (after decrease)"

The other mentioned terms, such as \"Although,\" \"were nearly identical,\" \"decreased only slightly,\" and \"significantly,\" do not clearly refer to material properties and can be removed from the table."
