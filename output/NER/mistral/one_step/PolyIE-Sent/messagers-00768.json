The paragraph also mentions \"units ( DPP )\" which can be considered a material property as it refers to a specific type of unit in the molecule. The figure is also mentioned as a reference, so it can be considered a material property as it provides visual information about the material. The rest of the paragraph does not clearly refer to material properties."
