DTG and DTS are not properties, but rather abbreviations for different materials (DTG stands for a specific type of material, and DTS for another).\n2. Intermolecular steric hindrance is not a property, but rather a phenomenon that can affect the properties of a material.\n3. The paragraph states that DTG has a longer C-Ge bond compared to DTS, so C-Ge bond length and C-Si bond length are the valid property values."
