This is a material property.\n* \"highest PCE\" refers to the Percentage of Energy Conversion efficiency, which is a material property.\n* \"5.05%\" is the value of the highest PCE.\n* \"V oc\" is an electrical property, but it is not explicitly stated in the paragraph, only implied as the cause of the high HOMO energy levels. Therefore, it is not included in the table.\n* \"PIDT-C12NT\" is a specific type of polymer, but it does not refer to a material property value. Therefore, it is not included in the table."
