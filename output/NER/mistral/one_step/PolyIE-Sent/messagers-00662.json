Therefore, it is a valid entity to include in the table. The other entities in the paragraph, \"P1 with three solubilizing n-dodecyl groups\" and \"common organic solvents, chloroform, THF, and toluene,\" are also valid entities as they refer to the material being described and the solvents it is soluble in, respectively."
