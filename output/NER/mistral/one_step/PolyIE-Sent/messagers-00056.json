However, \"peaked at ∼ 430 nm\", \"peaked at ∼ 620 nm\", and \"peaked at ∼ 680 nm\" are properties describing the absorption of PffBB-n at specific wavelengths. Therefore, we include \"peaked at ∼ 430 nm\", \"peaked at ∼ 620 nm\", and \"peaked at ∼ 680 nm\" as properties with the values in parentheses indicating the units."
