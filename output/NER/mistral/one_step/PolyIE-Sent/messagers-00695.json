However, if we strictly follow the definition of \"Property Value\" as a numerical or quantifiable value, then the entities \"electron-rich unit benzodithiophene\", \"electron-deficient unit bithiazole\", and \"electron-deficient unit benzothiadiazole\" can be considered as types of material properties or components, but not numerical values. Therefore, they can be considered as valid entities in this context, but with the understanding that they represent material properties or components rather than numerical values."
