Therefore, they should not be included in the table.\n\nThe other entities, \"J SC\" and \"HOMO energy level,\" are material properties that can be associated with the materials mentioned in the paragraph, so they are valid entities to include in the table. However, it's important to note that \"J SC\" is a specific material property related to the performance of the solar cells, and \"HOMO energy level\" is a property of the materials used in the solar cells. So, it might be more accurate to label the table as follows:\n\n| Material Name |\n| --- |\n| PCDTBT derivatives |\n| PSCs based on PCDTBT derivatives |\n| J SC (specific to the PSCs) |\n| HOMO energy level (of the materials) |"
