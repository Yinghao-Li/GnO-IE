J SC value: J-SC (Junction Series Resistance) is a measure of the resistance in a solar cell. A high J-SC value indicates good current flow through the solar cell.\n3. V OC: Voc (Open Circuit Voltage) is the maximum voltage that a photovoltaic device can generate under illumination. A high Voc indicates good voltage output from the solar cell."
