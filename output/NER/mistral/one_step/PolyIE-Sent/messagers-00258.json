Therefore, it should be removed from the table.\n\nThe remaining entity, \"best performances for a polymer : PC 70 BM blend ratio of 1 : 2.\", can be considered a property value as it refers to a specific value or level of a material property (performance) for a particular material composition (polymer : PC 70 BM blend ratio of 1 : 2)."
