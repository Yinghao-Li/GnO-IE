However, it's important to note that CAA is not a specific disease but a term used to describe the accumulation of amyloid-Î² peptides in the cerebral arterioles and arterioles of the leptomeninges in Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and other prion diseases. Therefore, it's essential to consider the specific context in which the term is used to accurately identify the disease entity."},
