The cause of this condition is \"adult mice that received neonatal injections of MSG (4 mg / g and 1 mg / g)\". MSG-induced conditions (neonatal injections) are not a disease per se, but a cause of the disease \"Seizures\" in this context. Therefore, both \"Seizures\" and \"MSG-induced conditions (neonatal injections)\" are valid disease entities."}
