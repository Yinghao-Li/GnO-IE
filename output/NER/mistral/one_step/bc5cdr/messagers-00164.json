Liposomal doxorubicin: This is a specific formulation of the anticancer drug doxorubicin, where the drug is encapsulated in liposomes for enhanced delivery and reduced side effects.\n2. Platinum: This is a metal element, and its compounds, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, are commonly used as chemotherapeutic agents.\n3. Paclitaxel: This is an anticancer drug, also known as Taxol, which is derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree. It is a taxane drug and works by stabilizing microtubules, preventing cell division."},

These are precise descriptions of specific drugs or elements used in the context of the paragraph. \"Phase 2 trial\" and \"refractory ovarian and fallopian tube cancers and primary carcinoma of the peritoneum\" do not refer to specific chemicals and are therefore not included in the table."}
