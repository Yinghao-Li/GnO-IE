Serum creatinine is a chemical substance that is mentioned in the paragraph. It is a waste product filtered out of the blood by the kidneys, so its concentration in the serum can be used as an indicator of kidney function.\n2. Hypotension is not a chemical substance, but it is mentioned in relation to the change in serum creatinine concentration. It refers to abnormally low blood pressure.\n3. Isoflurane is a chemical anesthetic mentioned in the paragraph. It is used during surgery and is known to affect kidney function in some cases."},
