    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Amiodarone use |\n\nIn the original paragraph, \"baseline risk factors\" do not refer to specific diseases, but rather to various risk factors that were controlled for in the analysis. Therefore, they are not considered valid disease entities in this context. Similarly, \"Class I antiarrhythmic agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin\" are drugs, not diseases. Therefore, only \"Amiodarone use\" is a valid disease entity in this context."}
