It is a measure of the electrical activity of the heart and can be considered a chemical process as it involves the ionic movements that generate heartbeats.\n\nSimilarly, \"basic sinus cycle\" refers to a single heartbeat, which includes the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave on an ECG. It represents the electrical activity of the heart and can be considered a chemical process as it involves the ionic movements that generate heartbeats."}
