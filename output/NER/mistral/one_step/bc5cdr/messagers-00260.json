    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| PTU (Phenylthiourea) |\n| MPO (Myeloperoxidase) |\n\nIn the original paragraph, \"Three ( 4 . 1 % ) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO - ANCA\" indicates that MPO and ANCA are the chemical entities being referred to. ANCA is an antibody, but it is often considered a chemical entity in the context of immunology, as it is a complex of antibodies that react with specific antigens on neutrophils. Therefore, it is included in the table. PTU is mentioned earlier in the paragraph as the therapy being administered, so it is also included as a chemical entity."}
