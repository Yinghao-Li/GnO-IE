This suggests that the person has been exposed to an excessive amount of opiates, which can lead to intoxication. Therefore, the valid disease entity is \"opiate intoxication\"."},

Opiate intoxication is the condition that results from the excessive consumption or use of opiates, so it is the valid disease entity in this context. Other entities such as \"ER\" (Emergency Room) do not refer to diseases."}

Therefore, it is not included in the table. The term \"ng/ml\" stands for nanograms per milliliter, which is a unit of measurement for concentration, but it does not refer to a specific chemical entity. It is included in the original paragraph only to provide context about the measurement of the opiate level."}
