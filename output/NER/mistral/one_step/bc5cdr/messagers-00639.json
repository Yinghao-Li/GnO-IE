However, the term \"high frequency STN stimulation\" refers to a specific type of electrical stimulation applied to the Sub-Thalamic Nucleus (STN), which is a brain structure. While not a chemical per se, it is often used in the context of deep brain stimulation therapy for Parkinson's disease, so it is included here for completeness."},
