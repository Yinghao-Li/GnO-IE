    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| aminoglycosides |\n| creatinine |\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"aminoglycosides\" is a class of antibiotics that includes several drugs such as gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. They are characterized by the presence of an aminosugar moiety in their structure.\n2. \"plasma aminoglycoside levels\" refers to the concentration of aminoglycosides in the blood plasma.\n3. \"creatinine\" is a waste product produced by the normal breakdown of muscle tissue. It is used as a marker for kidney function, specifically for estimating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\n\nTherefore, only \"aminoglycosides\" and \"creatinine\" are valid chemical entities in the given paragraph."},

It is a chemical compound.\n\nTherefore, only \"aminoglycosides\" and \"creatinine\" are valid chemical entities in the given paragraph."}
