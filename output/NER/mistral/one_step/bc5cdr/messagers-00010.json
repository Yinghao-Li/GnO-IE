Transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy is a specific disease entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Dehydration is a complication or a condition that can lead to transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy, so it is also included as a disease entity.\n3. Infection is another complication mentioned in the paragraph, so it is also included as a disease entity.\n4. Cancer is a condition of the patients, but it is not a disease in the same sense as transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy, dehydration, and infection. However, it is included here for completeness as it is relevant to the context of the paragraph."},

It is a condition of the patients, but not a disease in the context of this paragraph."}
