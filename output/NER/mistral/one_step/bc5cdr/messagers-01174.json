    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| QT |\n\nThe paragraph mentions medical conditions and their symptoms, but it does not clearly refer to any specific chemicals. The mention of \"QT prolongation\" refers to a measurement of the duration of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram, which is a physiological parameter related to heart function and can be influenced by various chemicals, such as certain medications. However, the paragraph does not specify which chemicals may be involved. Therefore, \"QT\" is the only entity that can be identified as clearly referring to a chemical in the context of the paragraph."}
