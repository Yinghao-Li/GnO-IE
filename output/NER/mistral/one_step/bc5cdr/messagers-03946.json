Therefore, the only valid entities that refer to diseases are exercise-induced tachycardia and isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. The other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"single doses,\" \"50 mg atenolol,\" \"cardioselective,\" \"40 mg propranolol,\" \"nonselective,\" and \"placebo,\" do not clearly refer to diseases."}
