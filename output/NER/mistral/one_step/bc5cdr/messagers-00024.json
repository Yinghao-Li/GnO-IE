However, the paragraph mentions that these compounds block \"voltage-sensitive K (+) channels, calcium-sensitive K (+) channels, and ATP-sensitive K (+) channels.\" The entities in this paragraph that refer to diseases are the types of ion channels mentioned: calcium-sensitive K (+) channels and ATP-sensitive K (+) channels."}
