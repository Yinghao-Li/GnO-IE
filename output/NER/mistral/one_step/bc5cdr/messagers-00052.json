Apoptosis is a programmed cell death, but it is not considered a disease. Instead, it is a natural cellular process that occurs in multicellular organisms. Therefore, no diseases were identified in the paragraph."},

Note that \"pyrrolidine ring metabolites\" refers to a specific type of metabolite with a pyrrolidine ring structure, so we include \"three\" to specify the number of such metabolites mentioned. Similarly, \"aromatic ring metabolites\" refers to a class of metabolites with aromatic rings, and \"five\" specifies the number of such metabolites mentioned."},
