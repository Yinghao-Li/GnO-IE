However, it mentions \"New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF,\" which refers to a medical condition called Chronic Heart Failure (CHF). While not a chemical entity itself, it is often associated with various chemical imbalances and drug treatments. Therefore, it is included in the table for completeness.\n\nThe second entity mentioned is \"left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0 . 30.\" This is a measurement of the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. It is not a chemical entity but a clinical measurement related to heart function."},
