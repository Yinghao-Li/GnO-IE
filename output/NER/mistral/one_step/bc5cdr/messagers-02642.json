Observe the reaction. Add a few grains of potassium iodide and a few drops of starch solution. The blue color of the starch will turn colorless, indicating the complete decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. In another test tube, add a few drops of hydrochloric acid to a solution of sodium hydroxide. Observe the vigorous reaction. In a third test tube, add a few drops of hydrochloric acid to a solution of ethanol and a few grains of iodine. Observe the absence of a reaction. In a fourth test tube, add a few drops of hydrochloric acid to a solution of acetic acid. Observe the formation of a gas and the appearance of a white precipitate. In a fifth test tube, add a few drops of hydrochloric acid to a solution of potassium iodide and a few grains of iodine. Observe the brown color of the iodine turning darker.\n\nIn this experiment, we used hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ethanol (C2H5OH), acetic acid (CH3COOH), potassium iodide (KI), and iodine (I2). We also used starch as an indicator and glucose (C6H12O6) as a reactant in one of the tests."},
