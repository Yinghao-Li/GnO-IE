Nephrostomy tube: A medical device used for draining urine from the kidney, usually when the urinary tract is obstructed.\n2. Ureteral lithiasis: The presence of a stone in the ureter, the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder.\n3. Single functional kidney: A kidney that is able to function normally, meaning it can filter blood and produce urine."},
