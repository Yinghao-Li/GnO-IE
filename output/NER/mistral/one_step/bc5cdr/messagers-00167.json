The paragraph also mentions \"these agents,\" which could refer to various drugs, but the context makes it clear that platinum and paclitaxel are the specific agents being referred to. The paragraph also mentions \"disease,\" but this is not a chemical entity. The paragraph does mention \"liposomal doxorubicin,\" which is a formulation of doxorubicin, so both doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin are listed."}
