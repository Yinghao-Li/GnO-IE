However, it can be associated with certain hormonal imbalances or medications that contain hormones, so it is included for completeness.\n2. Weight gain: This is a physiological process, not a chemical entity. However, it can be caused by various chemicals such as food, water, or medications.\n3. Muscle cramps / myalgias: This is a medical condition or symptom, not a chemical entity. However, it can be caused by various chemicals such as electrolyte imbalances, toxins, or medications.\n4. Transaminases: Transaminases are a group of enzymes that play a role in the metabolism of amino acids in the liver. They are not chemicals themselves, but they can be used as biomarkers to indicate liver damage or dysfunction. Elevations of transaminases in the blood can be caused by various chemicals such as medications, toxins, or viruses."},
