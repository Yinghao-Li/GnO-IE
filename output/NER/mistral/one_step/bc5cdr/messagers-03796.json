However, since no other potential causes for the observed difference in PGE2 synthesis between jj and jJ rats are provided, it is reasonable to assume that this difference is a result of the experimental intervention (aspirin treatment) and not an underlying disease. Therefore, the entities \"jj rats\" and \"jJ rats\" are listed as the only potential relevant entities."},
