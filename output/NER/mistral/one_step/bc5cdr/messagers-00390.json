The term \"GTN patches\" refers to a specific delivery form of the chemical entity Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), but since the paragraph only mentions \"GTN,\" it does not provide enough context to distinguish between the chemical and its delivery form. Therefore, only Diclofenac is identified as a chemical entity in the table."}
