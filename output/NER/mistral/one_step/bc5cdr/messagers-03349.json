Lithium and pilocarpine are both chemicals used in scientific research. Lithium is a metal element used in various applications, including as a medication, while pilocarpine is a cholinergic medication. In the context of the paragraph, they are used together in the \"lithium-pilocarpine model\" for inducing status epilepticus and brain damage."},
