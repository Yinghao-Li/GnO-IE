It is not a disease, but a measurement.\n* \"Fluctuating patients\" refers to patients whose blood pressure levels change frequently. This can be a symptom or a characteristic of certain diseases, such as hypertension or heart failure, but it is not a disease itself.\n* \"Hypotensive effects\" refer to the decrease in blood pressure below normal levels, which can be a symptom or a side effect of certain medications or diseases, such as hypotension or septic shock."}
