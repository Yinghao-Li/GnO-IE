Motor impairment is not a chemical entity, it's a symptom or a condition.\n2. Motor impairment was measured in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned and treated mice. 6-OHDA is a neurotoxin used to create a lesion in the brain for research purposes.\n3. The treated mice received L-DOPA + benserazide. L-DOPA is a precursor to dopamine, and benserazide is an inhibitor of dopa decarboxylase, an enzyme that converts L-DOPA to dopamine before it reaches the brain. Together, they are used to replace the lost dopamine in the brain of Parkinson's disease patients."},
