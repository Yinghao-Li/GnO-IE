It also mentions \"diabetes\" as a known risk factor for this condition. Therefore, both \"new-onset diabetes mellitus\" and \"diabetes\" should be identified as diseases. \"Schizophrenia\" is also mentioned as a condition related to the occurrence of new-onset diabetes mellitus, but it is not explicitly stated as a disease in the paragraph. However, it is commonly considered a mental disorder and is typically included in lists of diseases or health conditions. For the purpose of this exercise, we will include it as a disease entity."},
