These entities are drugs, and they are identified as such based on the context of the paragraph. \"monoHER\" is likely a form of Herceptin, a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of breast cancer, while \"DOX\" is likely Doxorubicin, a common chemotherapy drug.

These entities are drugs, and they are identified as such based on the context of the paragraph. There are no other entities in the paragraph that can be clearly identified as chemicals. Therefore, only \"monoHER\" and \"DOX\" are presented in the table."}
