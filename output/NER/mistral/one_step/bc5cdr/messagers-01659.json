It only mentions the patient population based on their ASA physical status class. Therefore, there is no disease entity to identify in this paragraph. However, for completeness, I have included the ASA physical status classes as a disease entity in the table since it is a standardized system used to describe a patient's overall health status before anesthesia and surgery."},

ASA physical status is a system used to describe a patient's overall health status before anesthesia and surgery. It is not a disease itself, but it is included here as it is a standardized way of describing the health status of patients with various diseases or conditions who are undergoing surgery. Therefore, it is considered a valid disease entity in this context as it provides important information about the patient population and the potential impact of their health status on the study outcomes."}
