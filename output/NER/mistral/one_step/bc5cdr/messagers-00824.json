It is primarily composed of lipids and proteins.\n\nThere is no clear chemical reference in the original paragraph for \"gliosis\" as it refers to a cellular response to injury or disease, characterized by the production and accumulation of astrocytes and other glial cells. However, gliosis can lead to the production of certain chemical substances, such as cytokines and growth factors, which can influence the microenvironment of the central nervous system. If you would like information on specific chemicals associated with gliosis, please provide more context or details."}
