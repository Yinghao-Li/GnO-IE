Therefore, the only valid entity that clearly refers to a disease is \"reversible toxic liver damage\". Other entities such as \"non-alcoholic\" and \"woman\" do not refer to diseases. Additionally, while disulfiram is often used to treat alcoholism, the paragraph does not indicate that the woman had alcoholic liver disease. Therefore, \"alcoholic\" is not a valid entity in this context."}
