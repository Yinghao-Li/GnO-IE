Epileptiform findings: These are abnormal patterns of electrical activity seen on an electroencephalogram (EEG), which is a test used to diagnose epilepsy. They are not chemicals per se, but they are electrical phenomena that can be associated with certain chemical imbalances in the brain.\n2. Electroencephalography: This is a diagnostic procedure that measures the electrical activity of the brain. It is not a chemical entity, but a diagnostic test that can help identify potential chemical imbalances or abnormalities in the brain."},

Therefore, the valid chemical entity in the paragraph is \"epileptiform findings\"."}
