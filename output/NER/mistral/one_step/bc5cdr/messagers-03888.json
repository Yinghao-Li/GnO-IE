The term \"therapy\" indicates a medical treatment, and in this context, it refers to the use of EACA as a drug or medication. Therefore, EACA is the valid chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. Other terms like \"agent,\" \"this,\" and \"several reports\" do not clearly refer to specific chemical entities and can be disregarded."}
