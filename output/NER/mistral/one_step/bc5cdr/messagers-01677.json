HAART stands for Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy, which is a combination of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS. However, since the paragraph specifically mentions \"generic\" HAART, it implies that the specific antiretroviral drugs are not being named in the paragraph, but rather the therapy as a whole is being referred to. Therefore, the chemical entity is accurately represented as \"generic HAART\" in the table."},
