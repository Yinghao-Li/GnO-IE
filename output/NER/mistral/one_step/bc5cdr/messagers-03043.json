    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| QT prolongation |\n| Multichannel blockers |\n| MEA (Multielectrode array) of hiPS-CMs (human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. QT prolongation: This is a condition where the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is abnormally long. It can increase the risk of developing life-threatening heart rhythm disorders, such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.\n2. Multichannel blockers: These are drugs that can block multiple ion channels in the heart, leading to various cardiac effects, including QT prolongation.\n3. MEA (Multielectrode array) of hiPS-CMs: This refers to the use of multielectrode arrays to study human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs). The study aims to show that this technique can detect QT prolongation induced by multichannel blockers."},

MEA and hiPS-CMs are not strictly chemicals but are included because they are often used as materials or components in chemical reactions or experiments. FPD is a measurement result, but it can be considered a chemical property or characteristic. Multichannel blockers are a type of chemical compound."}
