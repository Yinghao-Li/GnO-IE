MSSA bacteremia: MSSA stands for Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus Aureus bacteremia, which is a blood infection caused by the MSSA strain of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.\n2. Central nervous system (CNS) infection: This refers to any infection that affects the brain, spinal cord, or meninges (the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord). In this context, the suspicion for a CNS infection arises due to the patient's relapsing MSSA bacteremia."},
