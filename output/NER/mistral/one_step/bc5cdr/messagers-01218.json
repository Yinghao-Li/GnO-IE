The paragraph also explains that these drugs have a high affinity with the D2 receptor. Therefore, we have included \"Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS)\" as the main disease entity, and we have also included additional entities that provide more context and detail about the disease and its relationship to the mentioned drugs."},

Therefore, we have included this entity as the valid disease in the table. We have removed \"Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS)\" as a standalone entity since it is already included in the valid entity. We have also removed \"most commonly affected by\" and \"have a high affinity with the D2 receptor\" since they do not clearly refer to a disease."}
