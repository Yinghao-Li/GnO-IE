DOX: Doxorubicin is an anticancer antibiotic that intercalates DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis.\n2. p53: p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that plays a central role in the cellular response to various stresses, including DNA damage.\n3. STAT3: Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor that plays a role in various cellular processes, including inflammation and cell survival."},
