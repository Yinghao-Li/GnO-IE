However, it is important to note that this interpretation may depend on the specific context of the paragraph in the larger document. In some cases, \"neuropsychiatric symptoms\" could refer to specific chemical imbalances or compounds in the brain, but in this paragraph, there is no explicit mention of such entities."}
