Therefore, the entities are named as \"neurotoxicities associated with IT - methotrexate,\" \"neurotoxicities associated with IT - cytosine arabinoside,\" and \"neurotoxicities associated with IT - TSPA.\""},

The other mentioned terms, \"IT\" and the drug names (methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, and TSPA), are necessary to specify the type of neurotoxicities being referred to. Therefore, they are included as part of the disease entities and are presented in the table as well."}

These substances are methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, and TSPA. Since the paragraph clearly refers to these as chemicals, they should be included in the table with the exact names given in the paragraph. There are no other entities in the paragraph that can be identified as chemicals."}
