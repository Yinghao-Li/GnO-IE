Sumatriptan succinate: This is the only entity in the paragraph that clearly refers to a chemical substance.\n2. 5-hydroxytryptamine: While serotonin is a chemical substance, the term \"5-hydroxytryptamine\" is often used as a shorthand for serotonin. However, in this context, the paragraph specifically mentions \"5-hydroxytryptamine-1 (serotonin-1)\", which refers to a specific type of serotonin receptor. Since the paragraph is asking for chemical entities, it is more appropriate to list the chemical compound that the receptor interacts with, which is serotonin itself. Therefore, \"5-hydroxytryptamine\" should not be considered a valid chemical entity in this context. Instead, we list \"5-hydroxytryptamine-1 (serotonin-1)\" as a single entity, with the full name to make it clear that we are referring to a receptor and not the neurotransmitter itself."}
