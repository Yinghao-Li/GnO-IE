    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Angina with Sinoatrial block |\n| Alternating sinus rhythm with Sinoatrial block |\n\nExplanation:\nAngina is a disease, and the phrase \"under treatment for angina\" implies that it is the condition the woman is experiencing. The phrase \"Sinoatrial block\" refers to a specific type of heart condition, so it is also a disease entity. The phrase \"alternating sinus rhythm\" could be considered a description of a heart rhythm, but since it is associated with the disease \"Sinoatrial block,\" it is more accurately considered a manifestation or symptom of that disease. Therefore, the best way to represent these entities in a table is to combine them as described above."}
