    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| dialytic support |\n\nExplanation:\nThe paragraph does not contain any explicit mention of specific chemicals. However, the term \"dialytic support\" refers to a medical treatment process used to remove waste and excess fluids from the body, typically through a dialysis machine. The specific chemicals involved in this process can vary, but they often include electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate, as well as various dialysis solutions and preservatives. However, the paragraph does not provide enough context to identify these specific chemicals precisely. Therefore, we can only identify \"dialytic support\" as the relevant chemical entity in the paragraph."},
