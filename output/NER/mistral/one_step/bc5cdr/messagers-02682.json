However, since the paragraph does not specify which type of saline solution was used, and the focus is on the active compounds in the study (apigenin), it is assumed that \"saline\" in this context refers to the saline solution used for comparison in the study. Therefore, it is included in the table as \"saline (solution)\"."}
