It includes several hormones and their precursors, such as angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensinogen.\n\nThe original paragraph mentions \"renin-angiotensin system\" as a whole, but to be precise, only renin is a chemical entity, while angiotensin system refers to a group of chemicals and their interactions. However, since the original paragraph does not specify which particular chemicals within the angiotensin system are being referred to, it is best to keep it as a single entity in the table."}
