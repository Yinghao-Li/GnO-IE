Prolactin is a hormone, but it is not a chemical in the same sense as a small molecule or ion. However, the paragraph also states that this condition led to a 50% increase in \"DA concentrations in the ME.\" DA stands for dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter and a chemical compound. Therefore, dopamine is the valid chemical entity identified in the paragraph. Prolactin is mentioned as the cause of the increase in dopamine levels, but it is not itself a chemical entity in the same sense as dopamine."},
