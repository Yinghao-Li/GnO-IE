These conditions are not chemicals per se, but I have included them as they are the specific conditions mentioned in the paragraph that may be relevant to chemical entities in a broader context."},

However, since the paragraph does not mention any specific chemicals related to autonomic dysfunction or orthostatic hypotension, there are no additional chemical entities to include in the table."}
