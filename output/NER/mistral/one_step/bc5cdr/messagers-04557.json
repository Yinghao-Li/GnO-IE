Hepatitis B e antigen: This is a protein antigen associated with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen. It is used as a marker for HBV infection and for monitoring the response to treatment.\n2. Aminotransferases: These are a group of enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which are released into the bloodstream when liver cells are damaged. They are commonly used as markers for liver injury or damage."},

Both entities are proteins, but they are mentioned in the context of a medical test result, and are therefore considered chemicals for the purpose of this exercise."}
