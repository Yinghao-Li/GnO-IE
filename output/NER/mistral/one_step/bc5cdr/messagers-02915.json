    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| unrelated |\n| reduced-intensity |\n| allogeneic |\n| transplant |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph does not contain any explicit chemical entities. However, the terms \"reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant\" can be considered as a medical procedure involving chemicals. In this context, \"reduced-intensity\" refers to the use of lower doses of immunosuppressive drugs to minimize the risk of graft-versus-host disease, while \"allogeneic\" refers to the use of donor cells that are genetically different from the recipient's cells. These transplants often involve the use of various immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| reduced-intensity |\n| allogeneic |\n| immunosuppressive drugs |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe term \"unrelated\" does not refer to a chemical entity. \"Reduced-intensity\" and \"allogeneic\" were identified in the previous answer as referring to a medical procedure involving chemicals, specifically immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, we add \"immunosuppressive drugs\" as the precise chemical entity to account for the chemicals used in reduced-intensity allogeneic transplants."}
