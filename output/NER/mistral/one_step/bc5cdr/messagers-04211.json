    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Parkinsonian motor disability |\n| Dyskinesias |\n| Levodopa-induced dyskinesias |\n\nExplanation:\nThe paragraph mentions \"parkinsonian motor disability\" and \"dyskinesias,\" which are both diseases or conditions associated with Parkinson's disease. \"Levodopa-induced dyskinesias\" is a specific type of dyskinesia that can occur as a side effect of levodopa treatment for Parkinson's disease. Therefore, these are the valid disease entities in the paragraph.\n\nOther terms in the paragraph, such as \"brain serotoninergic transmission,\" \"fluoxetine,\" and \"dopamine agonist,\" do not refer to diseases but rather to potential treatments or mechanisms related to the diseases mentioned."}
