However, based on the context, it can be assumed that it refers to a condition affecting the nervous system.\n2. severe neurotoxicity: This term is a more specific description of neurotoxicity, indicating a severe or life-threatening form of the condition.\n3. nelarabine-induced neurotoxicity: This term describes the neurotoxicity as a side effect of nelarabine treatment.\n4. concurrent IT chemotherapy: This term refers to intrathecal chemotherapy administered at the same time as nelarabine treatment. It is not explicitly stated that it causes neurotoxicity, but the context suggests that it may be a contributing factor."},
