The paragraph discusses two different phenotypes (manifestations of a disease or condition) that result from DES exposure: pituitary growth and hemorrhagic phenotype. The former is described as having quantitative, additive inheritance, while the latter is described as having recessive, epistatic inheritance. Therefore, both DES-induced pituitary growth and hemorrhagic phenotype are valid disease entities."}
