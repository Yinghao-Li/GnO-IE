The paragraph mentions \"metabolic disturbance,\" but it does not specify which metabolites are disturbed, so it is not a valid chemical entity to include in the table. Similarly, \"cell elements\" and \"massive status epilepticus\" do not refer to specific chemicals."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| neurotransmitters |\n\nIn this revised version, I have removed \"cell elements\" and \"metabolic disturbance\" as they do not clearly refer to specific chemicals. The only clear chemical entity mentioned is \"neurotransmitters.\""}
