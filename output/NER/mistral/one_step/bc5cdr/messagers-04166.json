Arterial spasm: This is a condition where the smooth muscles in the walls of an artery contract, causing the artery to narrow and restrict blood flow.\n2. Medial changes: This refers to alterations or modifications in the medial layer of an artery, which is the innermost layer and is primarily composed of smooth muscle cells.\n3. Induced by L - norepinephrine: L-norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter and hormone that causes the contraction of smooth muscles, including those in the arterial walls, leading to arterial spasm."},

Therefore, it was not included in the table. The valid disease entity in the paragraph is \"arterial spasm.\""}
