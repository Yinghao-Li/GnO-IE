    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Ca (2+) overload |\n| Arrhythmia |\n| Apoptotic development |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Ca (2+) overload is a condition where there is an excess of calcium ions in the body, which can lead to various health issues.\n* Arrhythmia is a heart condition characterized by irregular heartbeats.\n* Apoptotic development refers to programmed cell death, which is a natural process that occurs in multicellular organisms. However, it can also be a response to various stressors and can lead to diseases if it occurs excessively or inappropriately. In this context, it is mentioned as a result of aggravated Ca (2+) overload and arrhythmia caused by aconitine. Therefore, it can be considered a disease in this context."}
