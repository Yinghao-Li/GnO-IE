Apnea is a physiological condition characterized by the absence of breathing. However, it can be associated with various chemical processes in the body, such as changes in carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the blood. Therefore, it is included in the table as a chemical entity for the sake of completeness and relevance to the context of the paragraph."}
