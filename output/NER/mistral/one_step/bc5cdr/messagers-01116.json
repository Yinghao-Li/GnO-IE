These conditions are collectively referred to as lipid disorders or dyslipidemias. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention specific diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or atherosclerosis. Therefore, the most precise entities that can be identified from the paragraph are high cholesterol and hypertriglyceridemia."},

These conditions are types of lipid disorders or dyslipidemias. Although the paragraph does not explicitly mention specific diseases, it is clear that the focus is on abnormal levels of these lipids, which indicates the presence of diseases. Therefore, the most precise entities that can be identified from the paragraph are high cholesterol and hypertriglyceridemia."}
