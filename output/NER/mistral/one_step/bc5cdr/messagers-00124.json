Similarly, \"severe bradyarrhythmia\" is a specific type of arrhythmia (heart rhythm disorder) that is mentioned in relation to the disease \"hypercalcemia\", so it is included as a related condition rather than a separate disease entity. However, \"findings in a bipolar patient\" and \"prompted the authors to conduct a retrospective study\" are not diseases and have been omitted."}
