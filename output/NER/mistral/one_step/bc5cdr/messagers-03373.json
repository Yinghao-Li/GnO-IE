However, they are included as they are the entities that are being discussed in relation to potential chemical exposure.\n* \"RRLT days\" and \"RRIW days\" are not chemicals but units of measurement. However, they are included as they are mentioned in relation to potential chemical exposure (Renal Reabsorption of Lithium Therapy and Relative Risk per Interquartile Work, respectively).\n* \"Renal Reabsorption of Lithium Therapy\" is a medical treatment, but it involves the use of lithium, which is a chemical. Therefore, it is included as a chemical entity.\n* The numbers (1.77, 0.90, 3.51, 1.37, 0.64, 2.92) are not chemicals but numerical values.\n* \"95 % CI\" and \"PTrend\" are statistical terms and are not chemicals. However, they are included as they provide context for the interpretation of the chemical data."}
