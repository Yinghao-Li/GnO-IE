It mentions two specific side effects: piloerection and cardiovascular effects. However, neither of these are considered diseases per se, but rather side effects or complications of the treatment. Therefore, only stress incontinence is identified as a disease in the paragraph."},

It mentions two specific side effects: piloerection and cardiovascular effects. However, piloerection is a physiological response and not a disease, and cardiovascular effects can refer to various conditions affecting the cardiovascular system. Therefore, only stress incontinence is identified as a disease in the paragraph."}
