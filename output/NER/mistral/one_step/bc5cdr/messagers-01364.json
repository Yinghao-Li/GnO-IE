    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| vomiting (vomitus) |\n| diarrhea |\n| tinnitus (ringing in the ears) |\n| hearing loss (loss of hearing) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"vomitus\" and \"vomiting\" are interchangeable terms, both referring to the act of expelling the contents of the stomach through the mouth.\n* \"diarrhea\" is a medical condition characterized by frequent, watery stools.\n* \"tinnitus\" is a medical condition characterized by the perception of ringing in the ears.\n* \"loss of hearing\" is a medical condition characterized by the inability to hear sounds.\n\nTherefore, \"second day\" and \"patient\" do not refer to diseases and can be removed from the table."}
