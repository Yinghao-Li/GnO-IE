Testosterone: The paragraph mentions \"Testosterone (1 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . d ( - 1 ) , sc)\" which refers to Testosterone as a chemical substance, with a dosage of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, administered subcutaneously.\n2. Androgen receptor antagonist (flutamide): The paragraph mentions \"the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (10 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . d ( - 1 ) , ip)\" which refers to Flutamide as a chemical substance, with a dosage of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, administered intraperitoneally.\n3. Estrogen receptor antagonist (tamoxifen): The paragraph mentions \"the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen (1 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . d ( - 1 ) , ip)\" which refers to Tamoxifen as a chemical substance, with a dosage of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, administered intraperitoneally.\n4. Aromatase inhibitor (letrozole): The paragraph mentions \"or the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (4 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . d ( - 1 ) , ip)\" which refers to Letrozole as a chemical substance, with a dosage of 4 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, administered intraperitoneally."},

Testosterone: The paragraph mentions \"Testosterone (1 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . d ( - 1 ) , sc)\" which clearly refers to Testosterone as a chemical substance.\n2. Flutamide: The paragraph mentions \"the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (10 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . d ( - 1 ) , ip)\" which clearly refers to Flutamide as a chemical substance, specifically an androgen receptor antagonist.\n3. Tamoxifen: The paragraph mentions \"the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen (1 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . d ( - 1 ) , ip)\" which clearly refers to Tamoxifen as a chemical substance, specifically an estrogen receptor antagonist.\n4. Letrozole: The paragraph mentions \"or the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (4 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . d ( - 1 ) , ip)\" which clearly refers to Letrozole as a chemical substance, specifically an aromatase inhibitor.\n\nThe words \"the androgen receptor antagonist\" and \"the estrogen receptor antagonist\" are descriptors of the chemical entities Flutamide and Tamoxifen, respectively, and do not need to be included in the table as they are already implied by the names of the chemicals. Similarly, the term \"injection\" (abbreviated as \"ip\" and \"sc\" in the original paragraph) refers to the method of administration and is not a chemical entity."}
