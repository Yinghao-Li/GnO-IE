Acute insulin treatment: This refers to the administration of insulin for a short period, usually hours to days. It is important to specify \"acute\" to differentiate it from chronic insulin treatment.\n2. Isoproterenol: It is a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist, which means it binds to and activates both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. It is used to induce cardiotoxicity in various experimental models.\n3. Streptozotocin: It is a chemical compound used to induce diabetes in animals by selectively destroying the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It is an antibiotic derived from Streptomyces mobilius."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| isoproterenol |\n| streptozotocin |\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Acute insulin treatment: While insulin is a chemical, the term \"acute insulin treatment\" does not clearly refer to a specific chemical entity, but rather a treatment or intervention. Therefore, it is not included in the table.\n2. Isoproterenol and streptozotocin are clearly identified as chemical entities in the paragraph and are included in the table."}
