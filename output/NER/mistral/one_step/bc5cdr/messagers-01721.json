ADR: The abbreviation \"ADR\" is commonly used in pharmacology to refer to Adverse Drug Reactions. It is not a specific chemical substance, but rather a term used to describe unwanted or harmful reactions to a drug.\n2. LOS: The abbreviation \"LOS\" is not a standard chemical entity, but it is often used in healthcare to refer to Length of Stay in a hospital or other healthcare facility. It is not a chemical substance.\n3. ADR (2 mg / kg / b. w. i. v.): This is a specific dose of a chemical substance, where \"ADR\" is the drug name, \"2 mg\" is the dose in milligrams, \"/\" is a separator, \"kg\" is the weight unit \"kilogram\", \"/\" is a separator again, \"b\" is the abbreviation for body weight, \"w\" is the abbreviation for \"per\", and \"i. v.\" stands for intravenous administration. Therefore, this is a valid chemical entity, representing the specific drug or substance given at the mentioned dose and administration route."},

ADR (2 mg / kg / b. w. i. v.): This is the only valid chemical entity in the paragraph. The other entities, \"ADR\" and \"LOS,\" do not refer to specific chemical substances, but rather to terms used in pharmacology and healthcare. In this context, \"ADR\" refers to Adverse Drug Reactions, which is not a specific chemical substance, and \"LOS\" refers to Length of Stay, which is not a chemical substance either.
