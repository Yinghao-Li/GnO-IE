The term \"blood gases\" refers to the gases dissolved in the blood, primarily oxygen and carbon dioxide. The other entities mentioned in the paragraph, \"blood pressure\" and \"ECG ST - T segment\", do not clearly refer to chemicals. Blood pressure is a physical property, and the ECG ST - T segment is an electrical signal."}
