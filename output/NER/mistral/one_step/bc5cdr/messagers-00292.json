The acronym \"DSE\" could refer to various conditions such as Dipyridamole Stress Echocardiography, which is a test used to diagnose coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, or myocardial ischemia, among others.

Therefore, these conditions are potential disease entities. However, without further context, it is not clear which specific disease or diseases the patients were admitted to the hospital for testing and treatment. Therefore, I have listed \"DSE\" and its potential associated diseases as the valid disease entities."}
