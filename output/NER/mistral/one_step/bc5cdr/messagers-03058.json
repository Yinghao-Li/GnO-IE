The paragraph states that the compounds S - 53482 and S - 23121 caused this condition when administered dermally (on the skin) and orally (by mouth) to pregnant rats. Therefore, the disease entity is \"teratogenic effects on fetuses of pregnant rats.\""},

The disease entity remains \"teratogenic effects on fetuses of pregnant rats.\""}
