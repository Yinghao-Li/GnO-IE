However, without more context, it is not clear which specific chemical entity VAL represents. Therefore, it is best to exclude it from the list of identified chemical entities. The other entities in the paragraph are clearly identified as specific chemical compounds (Hydrochlorothiazide) or dosages (VAL 320 mg, HCTZ 12.5 mg, HCTZ 25 mg)."}
