NADPH-d is an enzyme, specifically an isoform of diaphorase that uses NADPH as a cofactor. NOS is an enzyme that synthesizes nitric oxide, a signaling molecule. Both NADPH and NADPH-d are considered chemicals, while NOS is an enzyme that uses chemicals as substrates to produce another chemical (nitric oxide)."}
