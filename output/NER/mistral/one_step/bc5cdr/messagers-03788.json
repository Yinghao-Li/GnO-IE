Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia: This is a condition characterized by an abnormally high level of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood.\n2. Absence of glucuronyl transferase: This is a metabolic disorder where the liver enzyme glucuronyl transferase is absent, leading to the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin.\n3. Bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla: This refers to the accumulation or deposition of bilirubin in the renal medulla and papilla, which are parts of the kidney."},
