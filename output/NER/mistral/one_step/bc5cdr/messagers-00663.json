Lipophages: These are macrophages that have engulfed lipids, such as triglycerides, from damaged cells. The term \"lipophages\" is derived from the Greek words \"lipos\" (fat) and \"phagein\" (to eat).\n2. Fat cells: These are adipocytes, which are cells that store energy in the form of lipids, primarily triglycerides."},

Other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"phagocytosis,\" \"previously existing fat cells,\" and \"suggesting prior fat necrosis,\" do not refer to specific chemicals and are therefore not included in the table."}
