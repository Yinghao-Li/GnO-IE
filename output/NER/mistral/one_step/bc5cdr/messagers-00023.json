While there are mentions of diseases or health conditions, such as \"conditioned place preference\" and \"biphasic changes in motor activity,\" these are not diseases in the medical sense. Instead, they are behavioral phenomena observed in the study. Therefore, no diseases are identified in the paragraph."},
