However, since the paragraph mentions \"attributable to the drug combination,\" it implies that certain drugs may be involved in causing myositis. Unfortunately, the paragraph does not specify which drugs are responsible. Therefore, we cannot include specific drug names in the table as chemicals.\n\nCreatine phosphokinase (CPK) is an enzyme, but it is mentioned as a lab result with a specific value (769 U / liter). Enzymes are biological macromolecules, but they can be considered chemical entities for the purpose of this exercise."},

It refers to a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the muscles. Although it is mentioned in the context of a drug reaction, the paragraph does not specify which chemicals are causing the myositis. Therefore, it cannot be included in the table as a chemical entity."}
