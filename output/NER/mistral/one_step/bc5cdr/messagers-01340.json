Since these are all types of chemotherapy used for treating various diseases, they can be considered as \"disease\" entities in this context. The term \"neo-adjuvant\" refers to the use of chemotherapy before the primary treatment (such as surgery) to shrink the tumor and improve the chances of a successful outcome. Therefore, the entire phrases \"neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin,\" \"paclitaxel (Taxol),\" and \"cyclophosphamide neo-adjuvant chemotherapy\" are included as a single disease entity for each chemotherapy drug."},
