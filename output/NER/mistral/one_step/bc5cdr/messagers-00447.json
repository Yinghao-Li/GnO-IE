It is a complex mixture of several related compounds, but it is commonly referred to as Mitomycin C as a whole.\n2. 10 mg: This is the mass (weight) of Mitomycin C.\n3. m: This stands for milliliter, which is a unit of volume. In this context, it likely refers to the volume of a solution containing the Mitomycin C."},

The \"m\" in the paragraph refers to milliliter, which is a unit of volume. However, since no specific chemical is associated with the \"m\" in the paragraph, it cannot be considered a chemical entity and was therefore removed from the table."}
