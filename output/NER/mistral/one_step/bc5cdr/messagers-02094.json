The former refers to motor symptoms such as involuntary movements or loss of muscle control that can occur as a side effect of long-term levodopa treatment for Parkinson's disease. The latter refers to a range of psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, depression, hallucinations, and impulse control disorders, that can also occur as side effects of long-term levodopa treatment."},
