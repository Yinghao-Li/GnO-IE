While it involves the study of chemicals, the term itself is not a specific chemical entity. \"Blood chemistry,\" on the other hand, refers to the analysis of various chemicals present in the blood, such as electrolytes, glucose, and proteins. Therefore, it is the valid chemical entity in this context.]"}
