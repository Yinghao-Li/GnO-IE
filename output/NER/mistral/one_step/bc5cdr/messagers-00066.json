However, since the focus of the paragraph is on the effect of nitric oxide synthesis inhibition on haloperidol-induced catalepsy, it is included in the table for context. If the focus was on catalepsy as a separate entity, it would not be included.\n* \"mice\" is not a chemical and is not included in the table."}
