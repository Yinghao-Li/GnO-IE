Therefore, the only valid disease entity in this paragraph is \"Gentamicin-induced Nephropathy\"."},

Na / K - ATPase: This is a type of pump protein that transports sodium (Na+) ions out of the cell and potassium (K+) ions into the cell using ATP as an energy source.\n2. NHE3: This is a specific isoform of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE) family of proteins.\n3. NBC1: This is a sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter.\n4. AQP1: This is a specific isoform of aquaporin, a family of water channel proteins.\n5. Gentamicin: This is an antibiotic aminoglycoside.\n\nTherefore, the table above lists these entities as precise as they appear in the original paragraph."},
