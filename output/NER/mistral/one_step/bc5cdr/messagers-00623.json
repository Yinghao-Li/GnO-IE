Chronic progesterone: The paragraph mentions \"chronic progesterone pretreatment\" with a dosage of \"5 mg / kg / day for 21 days\". This is a specific chemical entity.\n2. Bupivacaine: The paragraph states that there was an increase in \"bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity\". Bupivacaine is a specific chemical anesthetic drug.\n3. Intact pentobarbital: The paragraph mentions \"intact pentobarbital-anesthetized rats\". Pentobarbital is a specific chemical barbiturate drug. In this context, it is mentioned as the type of anesthesia used, implying that the animals were not altered in any way, hence the term \"intact\"."},
