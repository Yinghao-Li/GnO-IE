However, the paragraph states that \"asterixis was triggered\" by adding or increasing the dosage of carbamazepine, so we include \"unspecified condition triggered by adding carbamazepine (CBZ)\" and \"unspecified condition triggered by increasing carbamazepine (CBZ)\" as disease entities. These entities represent the conditions or symptoms that were caused by the use of carbamazepine."}
