Central cardiovascular effects: This term refers to the impact on the cardiovascular system, specifically the central aspects of it.\n2. AVP (Arginine Vasopressin)-induced effects: Arginine vasopressin is a hormone that can induce certain effects, particularly cardiovascular effects.\n3. ANP (Atrial Natriuretic Peptide)-induced effects: Atrial natriuretic peptide is another hormone that can induce specific effects, including cardiovascular effects.\n4. Hypertension (spontaneous): Hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure, and in this context, it is described as spontaneous, meaning it occurs without an apparent cause."},
