They are not chemicals per se, but they are important parameters in the context of cardiac electrophysiology. Therefore, they are considered valid chemical entities in this context, as they are often discussed in the context of chemical interactions with the heart and cardiac drugs."},

SCL interval is not mentioned as a dose-corrected change, but rather as a risk factor with a p-value (p = 0.049), so it is not included in the table as it does not clearly refer to a chemical entity. Therefore, only U wave, QT interval, and QTc interval are valid chemical entities in this context."}
