COX - 1 and COX - 2 are enzymes that catalyze the production of different prostaglandins, including thromboxane. However, since thromboxane is the specific chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph, it is the only one that clearly refers to a chemical entity. COX - 1 and COX - 2 are included in the table for completeness, but they are not chemicals themselves."}
