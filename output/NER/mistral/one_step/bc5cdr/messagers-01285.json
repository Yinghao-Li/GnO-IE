The other mentioned entities such as hRPTEC, loss in free intracellular thiols, and increase in necrosis markers are not diseases but rather effects or outcomes of CAA."}

However, since the paragraph specifically mentions a reduction in protein, it can be considered a chemical entity in this context.\n* \"intracellular thiols\" are a type of chemical compound (specifically, a type of reducing agent) found inside cells.\n* \"necrosis markers\" are chemical substances that indicate the presence of cell necrosis, a type of cell death."}
