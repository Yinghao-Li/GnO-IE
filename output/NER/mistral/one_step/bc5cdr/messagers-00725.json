The second entity is \"after infusional vincristine,\" which is a cause or complication of the syndrome.

The phrase \"after infusional vincristine\" describes a cause or complication of the syndrome, but it does not refer to a disease itself. Therefore, we present only the valid entity, \"Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)\", in the Markdown table with one column \"Disease\"."}
