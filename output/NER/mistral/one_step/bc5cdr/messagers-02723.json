The first group received isotonic sodium chloride, the second group received a solution of 5 % dextrose and sodium bicarbonate, and the third group received isotonic sodium chloride before and after the contrast injection. Since isotonic sodium chloride is specifically mentioned twice, it is listed as one entity. The second entity is the solution given to the second group, which is described as a solution of 5 % dextrose and sodium bicicarbonate. The third entity is sodium bicarbonate, which is a component of the solution given to the second group."},
