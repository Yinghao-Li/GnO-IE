Therefore, it should not be included in the table. The term \"spontaneous pain behaviors\" could be considered a symptom or condition if it refers to a specific disease or condition that is being studied in the context of the research. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if \"spontaneous pain behaviors\" refers to a specific disease or condition. If it is just a general term for any type of pain behavior, then it should not be included in the table as it is not a specific disease."}
