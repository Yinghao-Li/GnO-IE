However, it does mention \"severe neutropenia,\" which is a medical condition characterized by a low number of neutrophils in the blood. Neutropenia is not a chemical per se, but it is a condition that can be quantified in terms of a unit, which is \"mm3\" (cubic millimeters). Therefore, both \"neutropenia\" and \"mm3\" are presented as valid chemical entities in this context."},
