The other entities mentioned in the paragraph, \"hepatomegaly,\" \"hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation,\" \"serum triglycerides,\" and \"glucose,\" do not clearly refer to chemicals. \"Hepatomegaly\" refers to an enlarged liver, \"hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation\" refers to a condition where lipid droplets accumulate in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, \"serum triglycerides\" refer to a type of fat found in the blood, and \"glucose\" is a simple sugar that is the primary source of energy for the body. While these substances are related to the chemical effects of Amiodarone, they are not chemicals themselves."}
