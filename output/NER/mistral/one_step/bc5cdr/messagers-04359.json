SHR: Shigren-Hirano syndrome is a disease.\n2. WKY: Wistar-Kyoto rats is a strain of rats, but it is mentioned as a comparison to SHR, so it can be considered a disease entity in this context.\n3. Phe: Phenylephrine is a drug, but it is used to induce Map elevation in the context of the paragraph, so it is mentioned as a disease entity to indicate the condition of Map elevation.\n4. CCB: Calcium channel blocker is a type of medication, but it is mentioned as being decreased in response to ANP and AVP administration during Map elevation, so it can be considered a disease entity in this context as it implies a dysfunction or lack of the normal response to these hormones.\n5. MAP: Mean arterial pressure is a physiological parameter, but it is mentioned as being decreased in response to ANP and AVP administration during Map elevation, so it can be considered a disease entity in this context as it implies a pathological condition."},
