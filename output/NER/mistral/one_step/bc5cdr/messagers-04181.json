However, they can be associated with certain chemical processes or implications, such as optic nerve pallor potentially being indicative of demyelination or axonal damage, vascular attenuation related to changes in blood vessel walls or function, and chorioretinal atrophy involving the degeneration of specific layers of the retina and choroid."},
