Indinavir is a specific antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 is a specific strain or type of human immunodeficiency virus. Both entities are important to identify as they are mentioned in relation to the study's focus on monitoring indinavir-related nephrotoxicity in HIV-1 infected children."},
