Tubular atrophy, interstitial infiltration, and fibrosis are also diseases or conditions that can be considered complications or manifestations of ADR nephropathy. Therefore, they are valid entities to include in the table. Other words in the paragraph, such as \"histological examination,\" \"could prevent,\" and \"showed,\" do not refer to diseases and should be excluded from the table."}
