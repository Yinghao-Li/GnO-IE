For example, coronary heart disease is linked to the buildup of cholesterol and plaque in the arteries, while cerebrovascular disease can be caused by the formation of blood clots. However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific chemicals, so the entities listed above are the best that can be identified based on the context."}
