While there are no explicit mentions of diseases in the paragraph, it is important to note that the context suggests that these responses may be abnormal or impaired in the groups treated with clentiazem alone. However, the paragraph does not specify what condition or disease may be causing these impairments. Therefore, no diseases can be identified with certainty based on the given information."},

The paragraph mentions that the contractile responses to isoproterenol are reduced in the groups treated with clentiazem alone, but restored and enhanced when clentiazem is combined with epinephrine. However, the paragraph does not specify what condition or disease may be causing the impairments in the contractile responses to isoproterenol in the first place. Therefore, no diseases can be identified with certainty based on the given information."}
