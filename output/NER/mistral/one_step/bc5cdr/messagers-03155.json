These entities are related to passive avoidance tests and are affected by STZ administration and castration. The acronym STZ stands for Streptozotocin, a drug used to induce diabetes in animals. However, in this context, it is not explicitly stated that STZ administration causes a disease, but rather that it is a treatment that leads to the observed memory loss. Therefore, STZ is not considered a disease entity in this paragraph."}
