The term \"spinal anaesthesia\" refers to a type of anesthetic technique where an anesthetic solution is injected into the spinal cord to produce loss of sensation in a specific area of the body. Therefore, the only potential chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"anesthetic solution\" which is not explicitly stated, but can be inferred from the context. However, since the paragraph does not specify the exact chemical composition of the anesthetic solution, it cannot be accurately identified and included in the table."},

Therefore, it is included in the table as an implicit chemical entity."}
