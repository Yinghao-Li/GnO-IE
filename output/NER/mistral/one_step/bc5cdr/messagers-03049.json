EAD: After reading the paragraph, it is clear that EAD stands for Early Afterdepolarizations, which is a phenomenon and not a chemical compound. However, since the question asks for chemical entities, it is important to note that there might be specific chemicals causing EADs. Therefore, for the sake of completeness, it is included in the list as a potential chemical entity.\n2. drugs with TdQTp potential: TdQTp is a type of prolonged QT interval, which is a condition associated with certain drugs. The drugs causing this condition are the actual chemical entities of interest."},

EAD (Early Afterdepolarizations) is a phenomenon and not a chemical compound. Therefore, it is not included in the final table."}
