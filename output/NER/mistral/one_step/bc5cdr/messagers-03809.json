However, it is often studied in relation to certain chemicals or drugs, so it is included here for completeness.\n3. neuroleptic: Neuroleptics are a class of drugs that block or reduce the effects of dopamine, a neurotransmitter. They are commonly used to treat psychosis and other neurological conditions."},
