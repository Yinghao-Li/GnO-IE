It can be a sign of cardiac ischemia or damage.\n* Myocardial Infarction (MI) is a disease characterized by the death of a portion of heart muscle due to lack of blood supply to the heart.\n* Non-MI, ANT-MI, and INF-MI are groups of people with different types of MI. Non-MI likely refers to non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, ANT-MI to anterior wall MI, and INF-MI to inferior wall MI. These are subtypes of MI based on the location of the heart damage."}
