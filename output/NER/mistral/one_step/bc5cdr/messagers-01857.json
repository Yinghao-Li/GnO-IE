CB1 receptors: CB1 receptors are a type of receptor in the endocannabinoid system. They are not directly mentioned as a chemical compound, but since they are proteins that bind specific chemicals (endocannabinoids), it is common to refer to them as a chemical entity in this context.\n\n2. dopaminergic lesion: A dopaminergic lesion refers to damage or loss of dopaminergic neurons, which produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. It is not a specific chemical compound but a condition or pathological state.\n\n3. L-DOPA: L-DOPA (Levodopa) is a chemical compound that is used as a medication to treat Parkinson's disease. It is a precursor to dopamine and can cross the blood-brain barrier to be converted into dopamine in the brain."},

CB1 receptors are proteins that bind specific chemicals (endocannabinoids), but they are not the chemical entities themselves. A dopaminergic lesion is a pathological condition, not a chemical compound. The only clear chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is L-DOPA."}
