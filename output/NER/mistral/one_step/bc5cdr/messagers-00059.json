The article states that benzene is the parent compound from which catechol and hydroquinone are derived, and that catechol and hydroquinone, but not phenol, induce apoptosis in HBMP cells. Therefore, all four substances are chemicals, but only benzene, catechol, and hydroquinone are directly related to the topic of the paragraph. Phenol is mentioned for comparison, but it is not the focus of the statement."}
