Mesangial overloading refers to an accumulation or overloading of the mesangial matrix in the kidney, which is a complex mixture of extracellular matrix components, including proteins and glycosaminoglycans. Therefore, \"mesangial overloading\" is the valid chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph."},
