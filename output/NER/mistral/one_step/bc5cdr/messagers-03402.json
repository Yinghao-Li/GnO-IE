However, since the paragraph states that these translocations are induced by an \"agent,\" it is reasonable to assume that the agent is the chemical entity causing the translocations. Therefore, we list \"t ( 9 : 22 ) translocations\" as the chemical entity in the paragraph, even though it is not a chemical substance itself.\n\nIf we had more context about the identity of the agent, we could have listed it as a separate chemical entity. For example, if the agent was named in the paragraph, we could have listed it as a separate entry in the table."},
