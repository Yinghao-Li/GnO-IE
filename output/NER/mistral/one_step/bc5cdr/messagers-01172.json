Therefore, they are valid entities to include in the table. The other terms in the paragraph, such as \"mean,\" \"+ / -,\" \"respectively,\" and \"were,\" do not clearly refer to diseases and can be removed. Additionally, \"LAD\" is an abbreviation for \"left anterior descending artery,\" which is not mentioned as a disease in the paragraph."}
