CHX is mentioned as part of the \"CHX + Pilo group,\" indicating it is a chemical treatment. Pilo is also mentioned as part of the same group, implying it is also a chemical.\n* GAP43 is identified as a protein, but it is referred to as a \"chemical\" entity since it is often discussed in the context of chemical signaling pathways."}
