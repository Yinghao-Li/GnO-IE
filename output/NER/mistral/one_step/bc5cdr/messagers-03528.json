    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| ornithine decarboxylase |\n| beta blockers |\n\nIn the paragraph, \"beta - blockers\" is a type of drug, specifically a class of drugs called beta blockers. However, since the paragraph is discussing their effect on \"suppressing the increased ornithine decarboxylase activity,\" it can be inferred that the beta blockers contain an active ingredient that interacts with ornithine decarboxylase, making them a valid chemical entity in this context."}
