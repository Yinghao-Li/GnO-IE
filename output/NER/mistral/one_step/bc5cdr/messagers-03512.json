In this case, since the original paragraph mentions it as a side effect of other diseases, it is listed as a symptom/side effect of the primary diseases mentioned.\n* Photodermatitis is a disease.\n* Blurred vision and contact lens intolerance are not diseases, but symptoms or side effects of diseases. Therefore, they are not included in the table."}

However, it can be caused by various chemical irritants. In this context, it is mentioned as a side effect, so it is included for completeness.\n\nContact lenses are a type of medical device made of hydrophilic polymers, such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) or silicone hydrogel. These materials are not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but they are the chemicals that make up contact lenses. Since the paragraph mentions \"contact lens intolerance,\" it implies that the chemicals in contact lenses can cause adverse reactions. Therefore, contact lenses are considered chemical entities in this context."},
