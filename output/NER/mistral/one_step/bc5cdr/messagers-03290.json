However, it is mentioned in relation to the study of specific chemical entities and their interactions, so it is included for context. The paragraph also mentions a \"mutation p. Val204Asp,\" which is a specific genetic mutation that affects the amino acid Valine at position 204 being replaced by Asparagine. The paragraph also mentions \"hydrogen bonding\" between specific amino acids \"Gln223\" and \"Glu441,\" as well as the movement of \"Ser198\" and \"His438\" away from each other. These are all specific chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph."},

The paragraph also mentions \"the type of substrate,\" but it does not specify what the substrate is, so it is not included in the table either. The remaining entities mentioned in the paragraph are specific chemical entities and are included in the table."}
