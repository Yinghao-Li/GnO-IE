However, since the paragraph mentions \"high post-operative serum Tbil,\" it implies that there may be chemicals involved in the transplant process, so I included LT for context.\n* Tbil is an abbreviation for total bilirubin, which is a chemical substance.\n* Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug, which is a chemical substance."}
