The paragraph describes the effect of this disease on the bladder afferent neurons, specifically an increase in NOS-IR (Nitric Oxide Synthase-Immunoreactivity) in L6 and S1 DRG (Dorsal Root Ganglia) neurons. However, the paragraph does not directly mention any specific disease or condition associated with NOS-IR or the increase in NOS-IR following chronic CYP administration. Therefore, the disease entity is identified as chronic CYP administration."},
