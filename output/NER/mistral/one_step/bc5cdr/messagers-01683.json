This reduction is used as a criterion for discontinuing therapy. Therefore, the disease entity is \"Sural nerve damage.\""},

However, this term itself does not clearly refer to a disease, but rather a symptom or indicator of a underlying disease, which is why \"Sural nerve damage\" is identified as the disease entity."}

To be precise, we can refer to it as \"sodium action potential of the sural nerve\" or \"sural nerve sodium action potential\" to make it clear that we are referring to a chemical process involving sodium ions."}
