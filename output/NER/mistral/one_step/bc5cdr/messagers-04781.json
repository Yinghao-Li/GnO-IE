Intrahepatic cholestasis refers to the type that occurs within the liver itself. The study mentioned in the paragraph is investigating the association between this condition and the inhibition of the neutral pathway of bile salt synthesis by 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE)."},

The paragraph describes a study that shows how 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE) induces intrahepatic cholestasis in rats and is associated with selective inhibition of the neutral pathway of bile salt synthesis. Therefore, intrahepatic cholestasis is the only entity in the paragraph that clearly refers to a disease."}
