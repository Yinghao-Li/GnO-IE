Therefore, \"cardiovascular dysfunction\" is a valid disease entity. Similarly, \"hypersensitivity\" is an abnormal response of the immune system to a substance, which can manifest as a disease or health condition. Therefore, \"hypersensitivity to sodium pentobarbital\" is also a valid disease entity. Other entities in the paragraph, such as \"chronic barium chloride ingestion,\" do not clearly refer to diseases and are not included in the table."}
