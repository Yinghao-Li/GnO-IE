PCR is a method used to make multiple copies of a specific DNA segment. It is not a single chemical compound but a process that involves several reagents such as DNA templates, primers, deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), MgCl2, and Taq polymerase. However, in the given context, the paragraph only mentions PCR as a process, so it is the only entity that can be identified from the paragraph."},
