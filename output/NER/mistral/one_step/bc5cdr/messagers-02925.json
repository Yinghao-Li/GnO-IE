Necrotising fasciitis: This is the main disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. It is a severe bacterial infection that causes tissue damage and necrosis (death) of the fascia, which is the connective tissue under the skin.\n2. Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia: This is a type of cancer that affects the production of antibodies in the bone marrow. It is also known as IgM Waldenstrom's disease or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. In this paragraph, it is mentioned that the patient has Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia and has received a treatment regimen containing bortezomib and dexamethasone, which may have contributed to the development of necrotising fasciitis."},

The entities that can be identified as diseases in this paragraph are \"Necrotising fasciitis\" and \"Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia\". Other entities such as \"bortezomib\" and \"dexamethasone\" are not diseases but rather medications. Therefore, they should not be included in the table. Additionally, \"elderly patient\" is a demographic descriptor and not a disease."}
