The paragraph describes that the mice were given different doses of DHEA (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg), but the chemical entity itself is named as \"DHEA\" in the paragraph. Therefore, we can identify \"amphetamine\" and \"DHEA\" as the chemical entities in the paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| amphetamine |\n| DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) |\n\nIn the original paragraph, the entities \"Swiss albino female mice\" and \"25 - 35 g\" do not refer to chemicals, but rather to the experimental subjects and their weight range, respectively. Therefore, they should not be included in the table. The entities \"were divided into 4 groups\" and \"amphetamine - free (control)\" are descriptive phrases and do not refer to specific chemicals either. The entities \"mg/kg\" and \"DHEA . 50\" and \"DHEA . 100 mg/kg\" are units of measurement and dosages, respectively, and do not need to be included in the table as they are already implied by the presence of the corresponding chemicals in the table."}
