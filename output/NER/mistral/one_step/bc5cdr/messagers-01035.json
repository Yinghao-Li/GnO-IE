QT refers to a specific interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) that measures the time it takes for the ventricles to repolarize and prepare for the next heartbeat. Hypocalcaemia is a condition characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood. Therefore, the valid entities are QT and calcium."},

Both entities are clearly related to chemicals, so they are the valid entities."}
