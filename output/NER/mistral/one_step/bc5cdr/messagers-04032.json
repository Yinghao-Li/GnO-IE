Albuminuria: The paragraph mentions \"Albuminuria due to renal damage\". Albuminuria is the presence of albumin in the urine.\n2. Renal damage: The paragraph states that \"renal damage led to\" albuminuria. Renal damage refers to harm or injury to the kidneys.\n3. Cardiomyopathy: The paragraph mentions \"observed cardiomyopathy\". Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle.\n\nTherefore, the valid diseases from the paragraph are albuminuria, renal damage, and cardiomyopathy."},

Both \"Albuminuria\" and \"cardiomyopathy\" are clearly diseases. \"Renal damage\" is also a disease as it is the cause of albuminuria. Therefore, all three entities are valid diseases and should be included in the table."}
