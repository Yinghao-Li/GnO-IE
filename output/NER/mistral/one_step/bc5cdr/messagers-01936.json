It is a medical imaging technique that uses iodinated contrast agents to enhance the visualization of the coronary arteries during the CT scan. However, since the paragraph does not explicitly mention the use of a contrast agent, it is not explicitly stated in the table. Nonetheless, it is an essential component of the coronary CTA procedure."}
