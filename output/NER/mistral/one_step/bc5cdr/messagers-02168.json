ADSD stands for Dystonic Disorders, a group of movement disorders characterized by repetitive and sustained muscle contractions, usually causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. However, since ADSD is not a chemical entity, it is included for completeness and to provide context."},

The other entity mentioned, \"ADSD\", stands for a medical condition, Dystonic Disorders, and is not a chemical entity. Therefore, only \"Botox\" should be included in the table."}
