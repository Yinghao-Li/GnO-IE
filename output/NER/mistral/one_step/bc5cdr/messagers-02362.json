Edema: The term \"edema\" refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space or in the cavities of an organ or tissue.\n2. Vasodilation: \"Vasodilation\" is the dilation or widening of the blood vessels, which can lead to increased blood flow and decreased blood pressure.\n3. Inflammation: \"Infiltration of inflammatory cells\" indicates the presence of inflammation, which is a complex biological response of tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. It is characterized by the presence of various immune cells, such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, in the affected tissue."},

Therefore, it was removed from the list."}

Edema: It is a medical condition where excess fluid collects in the interstitial space or in the cavities of body organs. It is not a chemical per se, but a physiological condition. However, it can be caused by various chemical mediators like histamine, bradykinin, etc.\n2. Vasodilation: It is the dilation or widening of blood vessels. It is a physiological process that can be induced by various chemical substances like nitric oxide, prostaglandins, etc.\n3. Inflammatory cells: These are white blood cells that play a role in inflammation. They include neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. They are not chemicals but biological entities, but they can be influenced by various chemical mediators."},

However, since the original paragraph mentions \"infiltration of inflammatory cells,\" it implies that there are chemical mediators involved in the inflammatory response, making \"inflammatory cells\" a valid chemical entity in this context."}
