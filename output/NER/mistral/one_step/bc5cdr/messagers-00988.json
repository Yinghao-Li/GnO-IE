Brain injury: The paragraph mentions \"Brain injury\" as a condition or outcome being measured.\n2. Ischemic hemisphere injury in the 15 / HTN group: The paragraph mentions \"Brain injury in the 15 / HTN group.\" The term \"ischemic hemisphere\" is not explicitly stated as a disease, but it is a specific type of brain injury, so it is included as a disease entity.\n3. Ischemic hemisphere injury in the 90 / HTN group: Similar to the above, this is a specific type of brain injury mentioned in the paragraph.\n4. Control group: The paragraph mentions a \"control group,\" but it does not specify what condition or disease the group represents. However, since the paragraph is discussing brain injury, it is reasonable to assume that the control group also has some type of brain injury or condition, even if it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the control group is included as a disease entity with an unspecified condition or disease."},
