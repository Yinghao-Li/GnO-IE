The lesion is not explicitly stated as a disease, but it's implied as a condition that causes a response to the Trimethaphan treatment."},

Lesion is not explicitly stated as a disease, but it's implied as a condition that causes a response to the Trimethaphan treatment. However, since the paragraph does not provide enough context to determine if the lesion is a disease or a surgical intervention, it is best to exclude it from the table."}
