DA response loss: The paragraph mentions that \"DA response was lost,\" indicating that there was a loss of function or effectiveness of dopamine (DA) in the body.\n2. Haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia: The paragraph states that \"a 9-month long haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia\" occurred. Haloperidol is a medication that can cause an increase in prolactin levels, leading to a condition called hyperprolactinemia.\n3. Extremely high increase in serum PRL levels: The paragraph mentions an \"extremely high increase in serum PRL levels,\" indicating a significant elevation of prolactin levels in the blood."},

DA response loss: This term does not clearly refer to a specific disease, but rather a loss of function or effectiveness of dopamine (DA) in the body. It is not a disease itself, but rather a symptom or consequence of an underlying condition.\n2. Haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia: This is a condition caused by the use of the medication haloperidol, which leads to an increase in prolactin levels in the body.\n3. Extremely high increase in serum PRL levels: This is also a condition characterized by an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood.\n\nTherefore, only the entities \"Haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia\" and \"Extremely high increase in serum PRL levels\" clearly refer to diseases."}
