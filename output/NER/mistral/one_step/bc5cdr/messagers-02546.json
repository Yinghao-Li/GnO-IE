    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| low-molecular-weight heparin |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe original paragraph mentions \"HIT type II\" and \"intravenous heparin\". However, \"HIT type II\" is not a chemical entity but a medical condition. Therefore, it should not be included in the table. \"Intravenous heparin\" is a specific form of the chemical heparin, so it can be represented as \"heparin, intravenous\". However, since the paragraph specifically mentions \"low-molecular-weight heparin\" as the recommended alternative to intravenous heparin, it is more precise to include it as a separate entry in the table."}
