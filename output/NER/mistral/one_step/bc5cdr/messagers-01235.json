It is discussing the role of endogenous dopamine in salience coding during associative learning. Endogenous refers to something that originates within the organism itself, so it is not a disease. Salience coding is a cognitive process, and associative learning is a type of learning where an association is formed between two or more stimuli. Neither of these concepts are diseases."}
