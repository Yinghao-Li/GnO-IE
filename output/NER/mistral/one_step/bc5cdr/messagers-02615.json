    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Dysregulated diurnal cortisol |\n| Psychological morbidity |\n| Physical morbidity |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Dysregulated diurnal cortisol\" refers to an imbalance or abnormality in the production and secretion of cortisol throughout the day, which is a hormone that plays a role in the body's stress response. This condition can be considered a disease or a symptom of an underlying condition.\n* \"Heavy recreational use of ecstasy\" is not a disease itself, but rather a behavior or condition that can lead to diseases or health problems. Therefore, it was removed from the table.\n* \"Psychological morbidity\" and \"physical morbidity\" are terms used to describe the presence or development of disease or illness, particularly in relation to the negative impact on an individual's mental or physical health. These terms can be considered synonymous with \"disease\" and were included in the table."}
