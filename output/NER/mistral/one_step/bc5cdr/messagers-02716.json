However, it's important to note that \"neuroinflammatory process\" is a biological process that involves various chemical mediators and immune cells, but in this context, it's being referred to as a single entity. Similarly, \"oxidative stress\" is a condition that results from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful molecules. So, technically, \"oxidative stress\" is not a single chemical entity, but rather a state or condition. Nonetheless, it's commonly referred to as an entity in scientific literature."},
