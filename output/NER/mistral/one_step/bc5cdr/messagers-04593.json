It only mentions \"granule cells of the dentate gyrus\" which are not affected by the treatments. While \"granules\" could technically be considered a type of chemical, it's more accurately described as a cellular structure within the neurons in question. Therefore, there are no clear chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph."}
