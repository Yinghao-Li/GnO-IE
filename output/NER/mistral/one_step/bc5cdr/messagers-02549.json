In this case, it is mentioned as part of the patient's medical history, so it is included as a disease. \"Substernal chest pain\" is also considered a symptom, but it is often used interchangeably with \"chest pain,\" which is a common way to refer to myocardial infarction or heart attack, which is a disease. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that the substernal chest pain is a symptom of myocardial infarction, so it is included as a disease. \"ST-segment elevation\" is a finding on an electrocardiogram, but it is a specific marker of myocardial injury, so it is included as a disease."}
