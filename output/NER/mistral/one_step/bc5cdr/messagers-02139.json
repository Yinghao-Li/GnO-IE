However, based on the context, it can be assumed that it is referring to the same chemical entity throughout the paragraph. Therefore, both instances of \"MB\" are considered valid entities. Warfarin is also mentioned as a chemical entity."},

However, for the purpose of this task, we are only interested in identifying chemical entities, so we need to clarify that \"MB\" in this context is not a chemical substance but rather a condition. Therefore, we add \"(Major Bleeding)\" in parentheses to make it clear that it is not a chemical entity.\n\nThe valid chemical entity in the paragraph is warfarin."}
