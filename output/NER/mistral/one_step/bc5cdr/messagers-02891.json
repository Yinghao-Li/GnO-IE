However, it is commonly associated with certain genetic and biochemical abnormalities, such as the t(15;17) translocation and the production of PML-RARÎ± fusion protein, which are relevant to its diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, it can be considered a valid chemical entity in the context of medical diagnosis and treatment."}
