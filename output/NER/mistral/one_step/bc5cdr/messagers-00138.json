It does not mention any specific diseases. These substances (D - AmB and NS) are not diseases, but rather interventions or treatments. The paragraph only reports an observation about changes in blood urea and creatinine concentrations, which are not diseases in and of themselves, but rather biomarkers of kidney function."}

Serum: This term refers to the clear liquid portion of blood. It does not refer to a specific chemical entity, so it is not included in the table.\n2. iv infusion: This term refers to intravenous infusion, a method of administering a liquid into a vein, not a chemical entity.\n3. rats: This term refers to rodents, not a chemical entity.\n4. but not in those given the same dose of NS: This phrase refers to a comparison between two groups of rats, not a chemical entity.\n5. 3 mg / kg: This phrase refers to a dosage amount, not a chemical entity.\n6. 718 : This term is not clear enough to identify as a specific chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, only D-Amikacin (D - AmB), Normal Saline (NS), blood urea, and creatinine are valid chemical entities in the paragraph."}
