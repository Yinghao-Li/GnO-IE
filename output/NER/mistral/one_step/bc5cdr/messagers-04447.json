Therefore, it is identified as a chemical entity.\n3. alkali: Alkali is a type of base, and it is mentioned in the context of the syndrome induced by 1, 25 ( OH ) 2D.

Therefore, it is not included in the table. The paragraph mentions \"Milk - alkali syndrome induced by 1, 25 ( OH ) 2D in a patient with hypoparathyroidism\", so the focus is on the chemical entities causing the syndrome, which are 1, 25 ( OH ) 2D and alkali. Alkali is a type of base, and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D is a specific form of vitamin D that causes the syndrome. Both are identified as chemical entities."}
