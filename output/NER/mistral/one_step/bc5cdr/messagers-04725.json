However, it does not directly refer to a specific disease, but rather a condition caused by a disease or treatment. Therefore, it was not included in the table. Similarly, \"severe abdominal pain\" and \"vomiting\" were not included as they were mentioned as \"adverse events\" without being explicitly stated as diseases."}
