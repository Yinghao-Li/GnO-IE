These are clearly identified as chemicals in the paragraph as they are named compounds that have decreased levels in the hippocampus of mice. GFC75 and P400 are identified as compounds as well, but they are not explicitly stated to be chemicals, only mentioned as treatments. Therefore, they are not included in the table."}
