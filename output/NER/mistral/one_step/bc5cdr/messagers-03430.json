However, it does mention \"sympathetic drive,\" which is a physiological response that can be described as the action of sympathetic nerves and the chemicals they release, such as norepinephrine. Since the paragraph specifically mentions \"sympathetic drive\" and not the specific chemicals, it is most accurate to list \"sympathetic drive\" as the chemical entity."},
