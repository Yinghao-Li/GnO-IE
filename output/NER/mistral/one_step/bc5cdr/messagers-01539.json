In this context, it is referred to as an HPMA copolymer, which implies that it is a copolymer of hydroxypropyl methacrylate and another monomer.\n\n2. DOX: DOX is an abbreviation for Doxorubicin, which is a well-known anticancer drug."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| HPMA copolymer |\n| DOX |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe original paragraph only contains two entities that clearly refer to chemicals: HPMA copolymer and DOX. Therefore, there is no need to remove any entities in this case. The other words in the paragraph, such as \"animals,\" \"given,\" \"study,\" \"P less than 0.05,\" and \"cardiac output,\" do not refer to specific chemicals and can be disregarded for this task."}
