This entity refers to a medical imaging technique that uses a special dye (contrast) to enhance the visibility of structures within the body on the resulting images. The term \"disease\" is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but since CT scans are often used to diagnose various medical conditions, it can be considered a disease entity in a broad sense."},
