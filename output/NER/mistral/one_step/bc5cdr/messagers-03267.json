UT - A1 protein: This is a specific protein, Uromodulin - A1, which is also preserved after PKCa ablation in lithium-induced NDI.\n3.

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| Lithium |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe original paragraph mentions \"PKCa\", \"AQP2\", \"UT - A1 protein\", and \"lithium-induced NDI\". However, \"PKCa\" is an enzyme, not a chemical. \"NDI\" is a medical condition, not a chemical. \"AQP2\" and \"UT - A1 protein\" are specific proteins. Since the question asks for \"chemical\" entities, only \"lithium\" remains as a valid entity."}
