The second disease is further specified as being related to the continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil, so it is also referred to as \"5-fluorouridyl-induced transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy\" or \"5-FU-induced transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy\". Both diseases are presented in the paragraph, so they should both be included in the table."},

Therefore, both \"cancer\" and \"transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy\" should be included in the table. Additionally, the table includes the more specific form of the second disease, \"5-fluorouracil-induced transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy\", to maintain the exact wording from the original paragraph."}
