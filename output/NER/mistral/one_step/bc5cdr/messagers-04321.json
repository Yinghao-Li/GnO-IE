While this phrase does not directly mention any chemical entities, it is related to the study of epilepsy and potential treatments or interventions, which often involve chemicals such as anticonvulsant drugs. However, the paragraph does not provide enough context to definitively identify any specific chemical entities related to the absence of seizures mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, it is best to exclude this phrase from the table.\n2. \"50 % incidence of death\": This refers to the occurrence of death in 50% of the cases. No specific chemical entities are mentioned in this phrase. However, it is important to note that many factors can contribute to death, including various chemicals or toxins, and it is possible that the context of the paragraph may provide additional information about the nature of the deaths mentioned. However, without further context, it is not possible to identify any specific chemical entities from this phrase with certainty. Therefore, it is included in the table as is."}
