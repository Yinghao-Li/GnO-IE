It is a specific type of hypertension (high blood pressure) that is caused by a tumor in the adrenal gland called a pheochromocytoma. This tumor produces and releases excessive amounts of catecholamines, including norepinephrine, leading to hypertension. Therefore, PPA is the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph."},

Therefore, Pheochromocytoma-associated Hypertension (PPA) is the only valid disease entity mentioned in the paragraph. Other entities such as \"propranolol\" and \"norepinephrine\" are not diseases but rather drugs that can interact with diseases."}
