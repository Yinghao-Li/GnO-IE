In this context, it is mentioned in relation to a chemical inhibitor (PDTC), so it is included as a chemical entity. Similarly, MAP kinases are a family of proteins that are activated in response to various stimuli and are considered a type of protein kinase, which can also be considered a chemical entity."}
