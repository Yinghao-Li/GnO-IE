Anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, resulting in insufficient oxygen being carried to the body's tissues. Bone marrow suppression is a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce enough new blood cells to replace those that are lost through normal turnover or destruction."}
