Therefore, menopause itself is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred as the underlying condition for which hormone therapy is being considered. However, the paragraph focuses on the long-term therapy for the specific stages of a woman's life, so it's more accurate to identify \"perimenopause\" and \"postmenopause\" as the entities in this context."},

Therefore, they are the only valid entities in this context that clearly refer to diseases. Other concepts mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"hormone therapy\" and \"women,\" are not diseases but rather treatments and demographic groups, respectively."}
