These are biological properties and not chemical entities. Therefore, they are not included in the table. The paragraph also mentions \"i.e.\" and \"which is characterized by\" to explain the name \"B 24 / 76 i\" for the first chemical entity. These are not chemical entities either and are also excluded from the table."}
