All other terms, such as \"mmHg,\" \"p values,\" and \"ms,\" are not diseases and can be removed from the table."}

The units \"mmHg\" and \"ms\" are also chemical entities as they describe the measurement of the pressure and time, respectively. Therefore, they should be included in the table as well."}
