PTZ is an anticonvulsant medication, and its side effect, specifically the injection form, is known to cause hepatotoxicity (liver damage). Therefore, it can be considered a disease entity in this context."},

Therefore, PTZ (Phenytoin-induced) is the valid disease entity in this context."}

PTZ is also a chemical entity, but it is mentioned along with the term \"alternate-day,\" which is not a chemical term. Therefore, we include PTZ as a chemical entity, but we assume that the \"alternate-day\" refers to the dosing schedule and is not a separate chemical entity.\n\nSo, the valid chemical entities are Metformin and PTZ."},

Therefore, we include only \"Metformin\" and \"PTZ (Phenytoin or Phenytoin sodium)\" in the table as valid chemical entities."}
