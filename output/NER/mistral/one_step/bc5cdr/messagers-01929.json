    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| serial markers |\n\nIn this paragraph, the only chemical entity mentioned is \"serial markers\". These markers are likely cardiac markers, such as troponins or creatine kinase, which are used to detect myocardial damage in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes. The paragraph describes two groups of patients: those who received coronary CTA (coronary computed tomography angiography) in the emergency department without waiting for serial marker measurements, and those who underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial marker measurements. The use of serial marker measurements indicates that the markers are being monitored over time to assess the patient's condition and determine if there is evidence of myocardial injury."},

These markers are mentioned as being used for cardiac marker measurements. The paragraph describes two groups of patients: those who received coronary CTA (coronary computed tomography angiography) in the emergency department without waiting for serial marker measurements, and those who underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial marker measurements. The use of the term \"serial marker measurements\" indicates that multiple measurements of the markers are being taken over time to assess the patient's condition and determine if there is evidence of myocardial injury. Therefore, the term \"serial\" refers to the repeated measurement of the markers and does not add any additional meaning beyond the chemical entity itself."}
