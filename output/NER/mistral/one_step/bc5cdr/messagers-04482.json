The paragraph describes the effects of this condition on the bladder and the L6-S1 DRG (Lumbar 6-Sacral 1 dorsal root ganglion). Specifically, it mentions that chronic CYP administration increases bladder weight by 60% and increases the numbers of NOS-immunoreactive (IR) afferent neurons in the L6-S1 DRG by 7- to 11-fold. Therefore, \"Chronic CYP administration\" is the valid disease entity in this paragraph."},
