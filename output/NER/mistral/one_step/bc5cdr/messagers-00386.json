    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| endometrial prostaglandins |\n\nExplanation:\nThe paragraph mentions only one clear chemical entity: \"endometrial prostaglandins\". Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are mentioned as a treatment option, but they are not chemical entities in and of themselves. They are a class of drugs that contain various active ingredients. Therefore, only \"endometrial prostaglandins\" should be identified and presented in a table with a single column labeled \"Chemical\". The entity is presented precisely as it appears in the original paragraph."}
