For the purpose of this exercise, it can be considered as a chemical process.\n3. CCK-8: Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a neuropeptide, but CCK-8 is a specific form of this neuropeptide. It is mentioned as a chemical entity in the paragraph.\n4. PS: Phosphate Salts (PS) are not explicitly mentioned as a specific type in the paragraph, but they are implied as the substrate for the electrophysiological measurement of the amplitude. For the purpose of this exercise, we can assume it to be sodium phosphate or calcium phosphate salts."},

However, since the paragraph mentions \"attenuated hippocampal LTP,\" it implies that there is a change in the chemical properties of the hippocampus, making it a valid chemical entity for this context.\n2.

Therefore, it is not included in the table."}
