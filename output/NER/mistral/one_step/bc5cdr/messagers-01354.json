However, since the paragraph only provides hazard ratios for the other mentioned chemicals compared to acetaminophen without aspirin, it is assumed that the comparison is made for acetaminophen alone and not in combination with aspirin. Therefore, aspirin is not considered a separate entity in this context."}
