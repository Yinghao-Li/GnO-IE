    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| sterile pacing wires |\n\nThe paragraph primarily refers to medical devices (\"introducer sheath\" and \"pacemaker\") and does not clearly refer to any chemical entities. The mention of \"sterile pacing wires\" is the only potential chemical reference, as wires can be made of various materials, some of which could be considered chemicals. However, the paragraph does not specify the material of the wires, so it is important to keep in mind that this identification is based on a potential assumption."}
