The text states that hypertension in diabetics who are prone to hypoglycemia attacks should not be treated with beta-blockers due to the potential risk of a sharp rise in blood pressure. Therefore, both hypertension and hypoglycemia attacks (for diabetics) are identified as diseases in the paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hypertension in diabetics prone to hypoglycemia attacks |\n| Hypoglycemia attacks (for diabetics) |\n\nExplanation:\nThe original paragraph discusses two conditions - hypertension in diabetics prone to hypoglycemia attacks and hypoglycemia attacks for diabetics. Both conditions are diseases as they refer to specific medical conditions. The term \"prone to hypoglycemia attacks\" describes a characteristic or risk factor for the hypoglycemia attack disease, but it is not a separate disease itself. Therefore, only the two diseases - hypertension in diabetics prone to hypoglycemia attacks and hypoglycemia attacks for diabetics - are presented in the table."}
