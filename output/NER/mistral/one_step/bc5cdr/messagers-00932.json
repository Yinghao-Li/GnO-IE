However, gentamicin is an antibiotic that can cause toxicity when used excessively or at high doses. Therefore, the disease entity can be identified as \"Gentamicin-induced toxicity\"."},

However, it can also be considered a solvent or a reaction component, but since it is being injected into the rats along with the other chemicals, it is more accurately described as a chemical in this context."}
