It only discusses the role of nitric oxide (NO) in motor behavior control and the potential impact of antipsychotic treatment on synaptic changes. Antipsychotic treatment is a type of medication used to treat various mental and psychological disorders, but the paragraph does not specify which disease or diseases are being referred to. Therefore, it is not appropriate to include \"antipsychotic treatment\" as a disease entity in this context."}
