However, it's important to note that AL itself is not a specific disease but a category of leukemias (Acute Leukemias). Therefore, it's more common to identify the specific type of Acute Leukemia if possible. For example, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) would be more precise. But in this context, AL is used as a general term for Acute Leukemia patients undergoing PBSCT."},
