However, it does mention \"sterile leukocyturia.\" Leukocyturia refers to the presence of white blood cells in urine, and \"sterile\" indicates the absence of bacteria or other microorganisms in the urine. Therefore, these two terms can be considered chemical entities in the context of this paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| sterile |\n| leukocyturia |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"sterile leukocyturia,\" which refers to the absence of microorganisms (biological entities) in urine and the presence of white blood cells (a chemical component) in urine. Therefore, \"sterile\" and \"leukocyturia\" are the valid chemical entities in the paragraph. Other entities such as \"children,\" \"younger than 5.6 years,\" and \"older children\" do not clearly refer to chemical entities and can be disregarded."}
