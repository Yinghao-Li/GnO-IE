    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| neuroleptic-associated hyperprolactinemia |\n| amenorrhea |\n| galactorrhea |\n\nExplanation:\nNeuroleptic-associated hyperprolactinemia is a condition where the use of neuroleptic drugs leads to an increase in prolactin levels in the body. Amenorrhea and galactorrhea are both conditions related to hormonal imbalances, amenorrhea being the absence of menstruation and galactorrhea the excessive production and secretion of milk from the breasts in the absence or decrease of pregnancy and lactation. Both conditions can be associated with hyperprolactinemia."}
