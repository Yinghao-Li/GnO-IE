Therefore, both \"aminoglycoside antibiotics\" and \"dextran\" are valid chemical entities to be identified.\n\nThere is no mention of \"acute renal failure\" or \"rats\" in the context of being chemicals, so they are not valid entities to include in the table. Similarly, \"regularly develop\" and \"following single injection of\" are not chemicals and can be disregarded."}
