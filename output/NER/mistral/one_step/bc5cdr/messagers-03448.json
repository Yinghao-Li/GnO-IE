The first entity, \"labetalol\", is clearly a chemical entity, specifically a drug. The second entities, \"halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane\", are also chemical entities as they are named inhalation anesthetics. Therefore, all four entities are presented precisely as they appear in the original paragraph and are valid entities for this table."}
