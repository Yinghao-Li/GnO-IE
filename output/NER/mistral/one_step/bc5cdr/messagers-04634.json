Age-related decrease in hypothalamic dopamine function: This refers to the natural aging process that affects the function of dopamine in the hypothalamus.\n2. Increases in PRL secretion: Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. The paragraph suggests that an increase in its secretion may be associated with the age-related decrease in hypothalamic dopamine function."},

The increase in PRL secretion is not a disease in and of itself, but rather a potential symptom or consequence of the age-related decrease in dopamine function. Therefore, only the former entity should be included in the table."}
