For the sake of caution, it is included as a potential chemical entity.\n2. RW: It is mentioned as the location where the patients received the RD treatment. It could potentially refer to a specific solvent or medium used in the administration of the treatment. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine its exact nature.\n3. 212 RRMM patients: While not a chemical entity itself, it is included as it is mentioned in the context of the study and may be relevant to understanding the context of the potential chemical entities mentioned."},
