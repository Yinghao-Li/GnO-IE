    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Homonymous hemianopsia |\n\nIn the given paragraph, only \"homonymous hemianopsia\" clearly refers to a disease. \"Confusion\" can be considered a symptom or a condition, but it is often used interchangeably with various diseases or disorders, so it is best to verify the context in which it is used to determine if it refers to a specific disease. In this case, since the paragraph does not provide enough context to determine if the confusion mentioned is a symptom of a specific disease or a standalone condition, it is not included in the table. However, homonymous hemianopsia is clearly identified as a disease that affected one patient in the Gamma Knife group."}
