The term \"sodium chloride\" refers to the chemical compound NaCl.\n2. diltiazem: It is a calcium channel blocker medication used to treat various heart conditions.\n3. contrast: In medical contexts, contrast refers to substances used to enhance the visibility of structures in medical imaging techniques like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs. These contrast agents can be iodine-based or gadolinium-based. In this context, it is not explicitly stated which type of contrast is being used, so it is left as a general term."},
