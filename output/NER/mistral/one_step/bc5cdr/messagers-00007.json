The biphasic reaction is a general term used to describe the occurrence of both an immediate reaction (dyspnea and loss of consciousness) and a delayed reaction (macro-papular rash) in patient n degree 1. Patient n degree 2, on the other hand, experienced a generalized sensation of heat, persistent pain at the site of injection, and a macro-papular reaction after 24 hours. Therefore, the valid disease entities in the paragraph are biphasic reaction, dyspnea, loss of consciousness, and macro-papular rash."},

Patient one had a biphasic reaction, which includes an immediate reaction (dyspnea and loss of consciousness) and a delayed reaction (macro-papular rash). However, dyspnea and loss of consciousness are symptoms of the immediate reaction and should not be considered separate diseases. Therefore, only macro-papular rash and biphasic reaction are valid disease entities in the paragraph."}
