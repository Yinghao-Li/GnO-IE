SOD (Superoxide Dismutase) is an enzyme that helps protect the body from damage caused by superoxide radicals, which can contribute to various diseases. DMTU (4,4'-Dimethylthiourea) is a chemical compound used in the treatment of certain diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis, by inhibiting the production of nitrosamines. But in the given paragraph, they are used in the context of a research study, and the paragraph itself does not indicate that they are causing or being studied for any specific disease in the rats."}
