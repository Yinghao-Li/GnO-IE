Dopamine is not explicitly mentioned as a chemical entity in the paragraph, but since it is an important contextual factor, it is often implied in discussions about \"dopaminergic neurotransmission.\" However, for the purpose of this exercise, we are only identifying the chemical entities that are explicitly mentioned in the paragraph."}
