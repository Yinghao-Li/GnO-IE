Drug: This is a general term used to refer to any substance that can be used as a medication or treatment.\n2. Antiglobulin test reagent: This is a chemical reagent used in the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) to identify the presence of antibodies or complement on the surface of red blood cells.\n3. Eluate: This is a liquid extract or filtrate obtained by passing a solvent through a solid substance. In the context of the paragraph, it refers to the filtrate obtained from the DAT.\n4. Microspherocytes: These are small, spherical red blood cells that lack a central pallor and have a high concentration of hemoglobin. They are a sign of hemolysis, which can be caused by various conditions, including drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia."},
