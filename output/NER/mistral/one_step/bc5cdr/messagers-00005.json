    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| contrast materials (PRC) |\n\nExplanation:\nThe paragraph mentions \"radiographic materials\" but it does not clearly refer to a specific chemical compound. \"Radiographic materials\" is a term used to describe substances used in medical imaging, such as X-ray films or screens, which do not refer to a specific chemical entity. Therefore, it was not included in the table. The term \"PRC\" is mentioned as a type of delayed reaction after the injection of contrast materials, so it was included as \"contrast materials (PRC)\" in the table."}
