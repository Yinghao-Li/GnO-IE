    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Neonates with excessive plasma concentrations of morphine (60 and 90 mg / ml) |\n\nExplanation:\nThe paragraph mentions \"excessive plasma concentrations of morphine in these neonates,\" indicating that the neonates have an abnormally high level of morphine in their plasma. Morphine is an opioid analgesic drug, and an excessive level in the plasma can lead to various adverse effects, including respiratory depression, sedation, and decreased heart rate. Therefore, the disease entity in this paragraph is \"neonates with excessive plasma concentrations of morphine (60 and 90 mg / ml).\""},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Neonates with excessive plasma concentrations of morphine (60 and 90 mg / ml) |\n\nExplanation:\nThe paragraph only mentions \"excessive plasma concentrations of morphine in these neonates,\" which clearly refers to a disease state. Therefore, there are no other entities in the paragraph that clearly refer to diseases, and the table only includes the entity \"Neonates with excessive plasma concentrations of morphine (60 and 90 mg / ml).\""}
