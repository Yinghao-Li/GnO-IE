The word \"nephrotoxicity\" is a condition caused by certain chemicals or drugs, but since we are asked to identify only the chemical entities, we should focus on the specific chemicals mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, \"nephrotoxicity\" is not included in the table as it is not a chemical entity itself, but rather a condition caused by chemicals."}
