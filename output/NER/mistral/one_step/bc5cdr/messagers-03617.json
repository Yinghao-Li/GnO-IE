The words \"first dihydropyridine available for use in the United States\" describe a property or characteristic of nifedipine, but the term itself is the chemical entity being referred to. Similarly, \"controls angina and hypertension with minimal depression of cardiac function\" describes an action or effect of nifedipine on the body, but the chemical entity causing that effect is still \"nifedipine\"."}
