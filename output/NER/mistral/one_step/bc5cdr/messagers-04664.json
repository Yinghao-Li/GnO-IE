    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| ibuprofen |\n\nIn this revised version, only the chemical entity \"ibuprofen\" is included in the table, as it is the only entity in the paragraph that clearly refers to a chemical substance. The other entities, such as \"placebo,\" \"double-blind,\" \"randomised,\" \"controlled,\" \"threefold cross-over design,\" \"subjects,\" \"males,\" \"females,\" and \"mean age,\" do not refer to chemical entities and were therefore removed from the table."}
