However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine if this condition is a disease or not. Therefore, it is included in the table as a potential disease entity."}

The term \"dose-dependent\" refers to the relationship between the amount of a substance administered and the response it elicits, but it does not directly refer to a specific chemical entity. The term \"blockade of sinus activity\" refers to a physiological effect, not a chemical entity."}
