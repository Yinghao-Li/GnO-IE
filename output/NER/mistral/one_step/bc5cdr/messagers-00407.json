    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| temocapril |\n| systolic BP in the PAN group (at 4 weeks, 14 weeks, and 20 weeks) |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"systolic BP in the PAN group\" which can be considered a chemical entity as it refers to a specific measurement of blood pressure, which is a chemical property of the body. However, it's important to note that \"BP\" stands for blood pressure and not a specific chemical compound. Therefore, it's more accurate to write it as \"systolic blood pressure in the PAN group\" or simply \"systolic PAN group blood pressure\". But since the original paragraph uses \"systolic BP in the PAN group\" and the goal is to present the entities precisely as in the original paragraph, we will keep it as is in the table.\n\nThe paragraph also mentions \"PAN group\" and \"PAN / temocapril group\", but these are not chemical entities, they are just labels for different groups. Therefore, they are not included in the table.\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"was normal\" but this is not a chemical entity, it's a statement about the measurement of blood pressure.\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"in the PAN group was significantly high at 4, 14 and 20 weeks\", but this is not a chemical entity, it's a statement about the measurement of blood pressure at different time points. Therefore, it's more accurate to write it as \"systolic PAN group blood pressure at 4 weeks, 14 weeks, and 20 weeks\" or simply \"systolic PAN group blood pressure (weeks 4, 14, and 20)\". But since the original paragraph uses \"in the PAN group was significantly high at 4, 14 and 20 weeks\" and the goal is to present the entities precisely as in the original paragraph, we will keep it as is in the table.\n\nSo, the only clear chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"temocapril\"."}
