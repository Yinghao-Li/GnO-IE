    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| nicotine |\n| alpha-bungarotoxin |\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"mice derived from a classical F2 and backcross genetic design,\" but this does not refer to a chemical entity. Therefore, it was not included in the table. The paragraph also mentions \"a relationship between nicotine - induced seizures and alpha - bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration,\" but \"nicotine-induced seizures\" is not a chemical entity, but rather an event or condition. However, the nicotine is the chemical causing the seizures. The \"nicotinic receptor concentration\" is a property of the receptor, not a chemical entity itself. The alpha-bungarotoxin is the chemical that binds to the nicotinic receptor, so it was included in the table."}
