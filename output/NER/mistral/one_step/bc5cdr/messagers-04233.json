The term \"pharmacological characteristics\" refers to the properties and actions of a drug or other chemical substance, so it is not a specific chemical entity. The term \"degenerative changes\" refers to the deterioration of cells or tissues, which is not a chemical entity either. The term \"especially in the muscles\" refers to a specific location, not a chemical entity."}
