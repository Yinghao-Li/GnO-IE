However, in this context, only \"progestagen\" is explicitly mentioned as one of the chemicals, while \"estrogen and progestagen\" is mentioned as a group. Since the paragraph does not specify which form of estrogen is being referred to, it is not included in the table as a separate entity. Instead, it is included as part of the \"progestagen-only OCs\" entity."}
