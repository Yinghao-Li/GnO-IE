Hyperglycemia refers to an abnormally high level of glucose in the blood. Elevated glucose tolerance refers to an impaired ability to metabolize glucose properly, as indicated by an abnormal glucose tolerance test result. Glucosuria is the presence of glucose in the urine, which can be a sign of diabetes or other metabolic disorders."}
