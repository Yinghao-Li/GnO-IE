It is not a disease itself. However, since the original paragraph mentions \"DRGs\" in relation to a \"small increase\" and \"no change,\" it can be inferred that the changes are likely referring to the diseases or conditions associated with the specific L1, L2, and L5 DRGs. Therefore, we include \"L1 DRG,\" \"L2 DRG,\" and \"L5 DRG\" in the table as potential disease entities."}
