It is not a chemical, but it is included because the paragraph mentions \"Cox regression models with time-dependent exposures,\" implying that \"Cox regression models\" is a type of model used to analyze chemical exposures.\n* time-dependent exposures: This entity refers to a type of exposure data where the exposure level can change over time. It is not a specific chemical, but it is included because it is mentioned in the context of chemical exposures in the paragraph."}
