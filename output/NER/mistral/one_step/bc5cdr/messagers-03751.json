The second entity is the cause of Bradycardia, which is \"high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy.\" However, since the paragraph mentions \"Bradycardia after high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy,\" it implies that the Bradycardia is a result of the therapy, so we can combine the two entities into one for the table."},

Therefore, only \"Bradycardia after high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy\" should be included in the table as the disease entity."}
