    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) in WKY and SHR strains |\n| AVP (Arginine Vasopressin)-induced increase in MAP in WKY |\n\nNote: In the original paragraph, \"ANP did not cause significant changes in MAP in both strains\" implies that MAP is a condition or state being measured in the study, but it does not refer to a specific disease. However, the paragraph mentions \"AVP-induced increase in MAP in WKY\" which is a disease state or condition caused by the administration of AVP. Therefore, we include \"MAP in WKY and SHR strains\" to represent the baseline condition of MAP in the two strains, and \"AVP-induced increase in MAP in WKY\" as a distinct disease entity."}
