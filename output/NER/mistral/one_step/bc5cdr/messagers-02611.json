    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| None identified in the paragraph that clearly refers to a disease |\n\nHowever, the paragraph mentions \"significantly elevated levels\" of cortisol in \"light users\". Cortisol is a hormone, not a disease, but it can be indicative of various conditions such as Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease, or other disorders of the endocrine system. Therefore, it could be argued that \"significantly elevated cortisol levels\" could be considered a condition or symptom, but not a disease in and of itself. If the context of the paragraph makes it clear that the elevated cortisol levels are a result of a specific disease, then that disease should be identified instead."}
