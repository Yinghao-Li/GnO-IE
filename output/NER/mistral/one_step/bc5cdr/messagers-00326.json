SOD1: The paragraph mentions \"transgenic C57BL / 6 - TgN [SOD1] 3Cje mice,\" which indicates that the mice carry a specific gene, the SOD1 gene. However, the gene itself is not a chemical entity, but the protein encoded by the gene, SOD1, is. Therefore, SOD1 is the valid chemical entity in this context."}
