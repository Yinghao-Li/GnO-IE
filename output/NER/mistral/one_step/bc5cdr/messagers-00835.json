Hepatic lipid homeostasis is a biological process, but since the paragraph states that amiodarone disrupts it, we can consider it as an affected system. For the purpose of this exercise, we will treat it as a chemical entity.\n3. PPARalpha is a nuclear receptor protein mentioned in the paragraph. It is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in various metabolic processes, including lipid metabolism. In this context, it is considered a chemical entity as it is the target of the toxic effect caused by amiodarone."},

However, since the toxic effect is caused by amiodarone, it is the only valid chemical entity in the paragraph."}
