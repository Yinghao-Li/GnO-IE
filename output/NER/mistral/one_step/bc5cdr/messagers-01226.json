    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2) |\n| EPS (Extrapyramidal Side Effects) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* DRD2 is a dopamine receptor subtype.\n* EPS is a side effect of certain medications that affects the extrapyramidal system, which is part of the motor system in the brain. It is not a chemical itself, but the term is often used in relation to drugs that can cause it, such as neuroleptics or antipsychotics. However, since the paragraph mentions a \"study on the relationship between DRD2 and EPS,\" it implies that DRD2 is involved in the development of EPS, so both entities are relevant to the chemical context of the paragraph."}
