    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| arterial pressure |\n| mm Hg |\n\nThe paragraph refers to \"resting mean arterial pressure\" which is a physiological parameter, but the term \"pressure\" can be considered a measure of the physical property of a fluid, and \"mm Hg\" is the unit of measurement for pressure. Therefore, both \"arterial pressure\" and \"mm Hg\" are valid chemical entities in this context."}
