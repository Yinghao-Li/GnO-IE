The term \"agents\" is a general term that could refer to various types of substances, including chemicals. However, based on the context of the paragraph, it is reasonable to assume that the \"agents\" are chemicals since the paragraph is discussing the risk of serious diseases associated with antibiotics. Therefore, the term \"agents\" has been included in the table as a placeholder for the specific chemical entities that are being referred to, but cannot be identified precisely without additional information."}
