Levodopa: It is a precursor to dopamine and is used therapeutically to treat Parkinson's disease and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).\n2. Dopamine: It is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motor control, reward, and addiction.\n3. Dopamine agonists: These are synthetic compounds that mimic the effects of dopamine in the body. They are used to treat Parkinson's disease and RLS.\n4. Central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists: These are drugs that block the action of dopamine at D2 receptors in the brain. They are used to treat various conditions, but they can induce or aggravate RLS symptoms."},

However, it does not clearly refer to a specific chemical entity, as there are various chemicals that belong to this class. Therefore, it was not included in the table."}
