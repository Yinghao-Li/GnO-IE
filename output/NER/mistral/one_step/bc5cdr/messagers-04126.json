Acute renal failure: This is a type of renal failure mentioned in the paragraph, which is a general term for the loss of kidney function over a short period of time.\n\nThe term \"rifampicin-associated\" and \"rifampicin-induced\" are descriptors of the relationship between rifampicin use and the renal failure, and do not need to be listed as separate entities. The term \"antirifampicin antibodies\" is not a disease, but rather a potential cause of the disease, so it is not included in the table."}
