    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| TS (Thrombosis or Thromboembolism) |\n| Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction |\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. \"Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries\" - This statement describes the result of a medical procedure and does not refer to a disease.\n2. \"moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction\" and \"with wall motion abnormalities\" - These phrases describe conditions or findings, but they are not diseases in and of themselves. However, \"reduced left ventricular ejection fraction\" can be considered a disease or a symptom of various heart conditions. Therefore, it is included in the table.\n3. \"consistent with TS\" - This phrase suggests that the wall motion abnormalities are indicative of Thrombosis or Thromboembolism. Therefore, TS is also included in the table."}
