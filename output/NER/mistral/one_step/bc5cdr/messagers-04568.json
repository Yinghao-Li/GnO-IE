These are the diseases to be identified and included in the table. Additionally, the paragraph mentions Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) as a potential diagnosis for the identified cases. While VTE is a broader term that includes deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, it is also mentioned as a diagnosis in the paragraph, so it is included in the table as well."},

These are the specific diseases to be identified and included in the table. The term \"anticoagulant\" refers to a medication used to treat or prevent these diseases, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, it should not be included in the table. Additionally, the term \"VTE\" is mentioned as a potential diagnosis, but it is a broader term that includes deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus. Since the paragraph specifically mentions these three diseases, they should be included in the table instead of the broader term VTE."}
