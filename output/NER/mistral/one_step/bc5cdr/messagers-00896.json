Oxidative damage typically involves the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage cellular components, including mitochondrial DNA and proteins.\n\n2. \"nitrative damage\": This refers to damage caused to biomolecules through nitration, a process that involves the addition of a nitro group (-NO2) to a molecule. Nitrative damage can occur through the action of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO-)."},

These entities are related to specific types of damage caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, respectively. Therefore, they are the only entities that should be included in the table."}
