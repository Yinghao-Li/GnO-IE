These are the chemical entities to be identified. Additionally, the paragraph mentions gentamicin as the substance causing acute renal failure in rats, and adenosine as the antagonist to which these alkylxanthines act as antagonists. Therefore, both gentamicin and adenosine are also valid chemical entities to include in the table."},
