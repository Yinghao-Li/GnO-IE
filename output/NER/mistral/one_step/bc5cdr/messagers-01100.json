Similarly, \"has also antioxidant properties\" describes a property of erdosteine, but does not change the fact that erdosteine itself is a chemical substance. \"Renal impairment in rats\" is not a chemical, but rather a condition or effect. \"The aims of this study\" and \"in rats\" are not chemicals either."}
