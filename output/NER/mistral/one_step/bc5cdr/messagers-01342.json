It is a physiological condition characterized by a heart rate below the normal range for a given age and physical condition. In this context, it was mentioned that the person was found to be bradycardic during a pre-operative assessment. Therefore, it is considered a chemical entity as it relates to the biochemical processes involved in heart rate regulation."},

Therefore, it is the only valid entity to include in the table. Other terms in the paragraph, such as \"pre-operative assessment\" and \"cardiac symptoms,\" do not refer to specific chemicals and are not included in the table."}
