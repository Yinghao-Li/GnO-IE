Induction chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses chemotherapy to shrink a tumor before further treatment. An autologous transplant is a medical procedure where a patient's own cells, such as bone marrow or stem cells, are collected, treated, and then returned to the patient to replace destroyed or damaged cells due to chemotherapy or radiation therapy."}

Induction chemotherapy: This refers to the initial administration of one or more chemotherapy drugs to shrink the tumor before the main treatment. It is called \"induction\" because it is intended to induce a response from the body.\n2. Autologous transplant: An autologous transplant is a type of bone marrow or stem cell transplant in which the donor and the recipient are the same person. The patient's own cells are collected, treated, and then returned to the patient after the chemotherapy or radiation therapy to help the bone marrow recover and produce new blood cells."},
