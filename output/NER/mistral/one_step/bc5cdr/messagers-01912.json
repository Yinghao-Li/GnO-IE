It is not a chemical per se, but a clinical condition that can be caused by various chemical and non-chemical factors. However, anemia can be induced by certain chemicals, such as lead, arsenic, or benzene, making it relevant to include it in this context."},

While these conditions can be caused by various factors, including chemicals, they are not chemicals themselves."}
