The other entities, \"brain\" and \"RAS\", are not chemical entities but rather a biological system and a signaling pathway, respectively. The \"beta - adrenoceptor (beta - AR)\" is mentioned as a target for isoproterenol, but it is not explicitly stated as a chemical entity, so it is not included in the table."}
