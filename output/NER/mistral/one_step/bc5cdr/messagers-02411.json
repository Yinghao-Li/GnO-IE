Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor: This is a class of chemicals, but the paragraph specifically mentions \"Captopril\" as the inhibitor used in the study, so it is more precise to list Captopril as the chemical entity. Therefore, \"angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\" is not a valid chemical entity in this context."}
