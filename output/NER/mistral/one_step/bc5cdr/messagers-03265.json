It mentions a reduction in AQP2 expression in lithium-treated WT animals and a smaller reduction in AQP2 expression in lithium-treated PKCa KO mice. It also mentions that UT-A1 expression was unaffected in lithium-treated PKCa KO mice. However, the paragraph does not mention any diseases or conditions.
