Chronic epinephrine infusion: This is the treatment or intervention that was applied to the rats in the study. It is not a disease but a medical procedure. However, since the focus of the paragraph is on the health outcomes of this procedure, it can be considered a contextual entity related to the diseases observed.\n2. Severe ischemic lesions: This is a condition or pathology described in the paragraph. It refers to damage or injury to the tissue due to reduced blood flow, which can lead to cell death and tissue damage.\n3. Fibrosis of the left ventricles: This is also a condition or pathology described in the paragraph. It refers to the excessive growth of connective tissue in the left ventricle of the heart, which can impair its function and lead to heart failure."},
