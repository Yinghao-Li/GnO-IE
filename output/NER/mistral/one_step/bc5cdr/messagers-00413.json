The \"neprotic\" modifier likely refers to the presence of necrotic (dead) protein in the urine, which is a common feature of this condition."},

Instead, they describe the treatment and its effect on the disease. The remaining entity, \"PAN nephropathy (PAN neprotic),\" is a clear reference to a disease."}
