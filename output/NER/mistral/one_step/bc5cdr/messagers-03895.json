It is not a chemical substance itself, but it is a clinical condition that can be caused by various chemical mediators or substances. However, since the paragraph does not mention any specific chemical mediators or substances causing leukocytosis in the monkeys, the only valid chemical entity in this paragraph is \"Leukocytosis\" itself."},

It is not clear from the paragraph if any specific chemical substances are causing this condition in the monkeys. Therefore, \"monkeys\" and \"were observed\" do not refer to chemical entities and can be disregarded. The valid chemical entity is \"Leukocytosis.\""}
