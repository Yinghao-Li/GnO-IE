    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Proteinuria |\n| (Expected complication in) proteinuria in transplant patients treated with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-i) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Proteinuria is a clear disease entity.\n2. \"Complication in transplant patients\" is not a specific disease, but rather a description of a situation where a disease (proteinuria) occurs. Therefore, we include the phrase \"in transplant patients\" as part of the description of proteinuria.\n3. \"Transplant patients treated with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-i)\" is not a disease, but rather a description of a population of patients who are at risk for developing proteinuria. Therefore, we include this information as part of the description of proteinuria as an \"expected complication in proteinuria in transplant patients treated with mTOR-i\"."}
