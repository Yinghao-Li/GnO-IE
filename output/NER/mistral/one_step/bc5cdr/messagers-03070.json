However, it is important to note that this interpretation is not the typical usage of the term \"chemical\" in chemistry and pharmacology. In these fields, a chemical is usually understood to be a pure substance with a definite composition and structure. The dosing regimen, on the other hand, is a combination of a quantity (100 mg) and a unit (mg/m^2) that describes how much of a substance should be administered to a patient based on their body surface area."}
