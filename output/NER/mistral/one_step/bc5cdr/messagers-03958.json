The term \"estrogens\" refers to a class of hormones, but since the paragraph specifically mentions \"progestins\" as a balancing agent for the effects of estrogens, it is assumed that estrogens are also hormones and not a specific chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, only \"progestins\" is identified as a chemical entity in the paragraph."}
