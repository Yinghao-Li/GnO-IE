Luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone (LHRH): It is a hormone that is released from the hypothalamus and stimulates the pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.\n2. Haloperidol: It is an antipsychotic medication. It blocks the dopamine receptors in the brain and is used to treat various conditions like schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, and hiccups.\n3. Prolactin: It is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland. It plays a role in the development of mammary glands during pregnancy and lactation. In adults, it also has other functions, such as regulating immune system function and metabolism.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph discusses the pituitary response to LHRH during haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia. So, LHRH, haloperidol, and prolactin are the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| Luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone (LHRH) |\n| Haloperidol |\n| Prolactin |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"Luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone (LHRH)\" and \"Haloperidol\" as chemical entities. \"Prolactin\" is also mentioned as a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, but since it is a hormone and a chemical substance, it is still considered a valid chemical entity in this context. Therefore, all three entities are presented in the table."}
