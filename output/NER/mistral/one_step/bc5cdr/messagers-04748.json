It only describes two methods used for performing pallidotomies in two different groups of patients. Pallidotomy is a surgical procedure used to treat certain movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease, by destroying a small area of tissue in the globus pallidus. However, the paragraph does not provide enough context to determine if the patients in the study had any specific diseases."}
