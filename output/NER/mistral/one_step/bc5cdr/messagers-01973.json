    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| wide-field multifocal electroretinography |\n| conventional visual field testing |\n| static perimetry |\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. wide-field multifocal electroretinography: This is a type of electroretinography (ERG), which is a test used to measure the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. The \"wide-field\" and \"multifocal\" modifications refer to the larger area of the retina that is tested and the ability to measure responses from multiple points in the visual field simultaneously.\n2. conventional visual field testing: This is a type of visual field testing, which measures the sensitivity and extent of vision in different areas of the visual field. The term \"conventional\" is used to distinguish it from newer, more advanced testing methods.\n3. static perimetry: This is a specific type of visual field testing, where the patient is asked to press a button each time they see a light stimulus presented in a standardized pattern. The term \"static\" refers to the fact that the pattern of stimuli does not change during the test."},

They refer to specific medical tests used to assess vision. Therefore, they should not be included in the table."}
