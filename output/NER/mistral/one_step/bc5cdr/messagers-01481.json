However, I identified \"normal\" and \"vocal cord function\" as potential entities since they could be considered as states or properties of certain biological systems. \"Normal\" implies a healthy or expected state, while \"vocal cord function\" refers to the physiological processes involved in producing voice. These entities are not chemicals in the strict sense, but they are important contextual information related to the paragraph's topic."},

Therefore, it should not be included in the table. The only remaining entity is \"vocal cord function,\" which could be considered a complex biological system or process, but for the sake of simplicity, it is included as a single entity in this table."}
