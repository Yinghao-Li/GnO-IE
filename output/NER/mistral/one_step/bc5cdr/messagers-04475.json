The term \"hemorrhagic F2 pituitaries\" refers to a specific type of pituitary gland, which is not a chemical entity per se but rather a biological one. However, since the paragraph is discussing genetic regulation of phenotypes in the context of these pituitaries, it is reasonable to assume that any mentioned genes or regulatory molecules would be involved in the development or function of these glands. Unfortunately, the paragraph does not provide enough information to identify any specific genes or regulatory molecules."},
