It is not a disease per se, but rather a condition that can contribute to various diseases.\n* \"Epileptogenesis\" refers to the process by which an individual develops epilepsy, which is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures.\n* \"Cognitive deficits\" refer to impairments in cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, perception, and problem-solving abilities. These deficits can be caused by various diseases or conditions, including neurological disorders, brain injuries, and infections."}
