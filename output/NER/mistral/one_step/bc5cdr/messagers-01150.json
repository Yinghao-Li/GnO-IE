They are responsible for the development and maintenance of male sex characteristics.\n2. corticosteroid: Corticosteroids are a class of hormones that are produced naturally in the adrenal glands. They help to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system.\n3. Fanconi 's anemia: Fanconi's anemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of red blood cells. It is characterized by bone marrow failure and increased susceptibility to certain cancers. It is not a chemical entity itself, but it is mentioned in the context of patients with this condition developing non-metastasizing hepatic neoplasms and peliosis while being treated with androgens and corticosteroids."},
