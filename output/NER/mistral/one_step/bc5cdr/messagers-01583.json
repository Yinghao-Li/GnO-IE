It does not mention any specific NSAID drug by name, so we cannot identify a more precise chemical entity than NSAIDs as a class. The paragraph also mentions \"ATIN\" but it does not provide enough context to determine if it is a chemical entity or an acronym for a specific condition or test. Therefore, we cannot include it in the table. The paragraph also mentions \"granular immune complex\" but it is not clear if this is a specific chemical entity or a description of a phenomenon, so we cannot include it in the table either."},
