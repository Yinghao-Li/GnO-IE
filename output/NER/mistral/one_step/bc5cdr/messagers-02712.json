Memantine is given at a dose of 10mg/kg and Ibuprofen at a dose of 50mg/kg. The third entity, STZ, is mentioned as the inducer of the conditions (glial activation, apoptotic cell death, and post synaptic neurotoxicity) in the rat brain. Therefore, STZ is also considered a chemical entity in this context."},

Memantine and Ibuprofen are clearly identified as chemicals being used for treatment, and Streptozotocin is identified as the inducer of the conditions in the rat brain. Therefore, all three entities are chemical entities in this context."}
