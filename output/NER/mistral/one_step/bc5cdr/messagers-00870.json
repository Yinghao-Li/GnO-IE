However, it does mention two medical conditions: nephrogenic DI (Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic) and neurogenic DI (Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic). These conditions are not chemicals per se, but they are often discussed in the context of chemical imbalances in the body. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise, we can consider them as \"chemical entities\" in a broad sense, as they are closely related to the chemical processes in the body."},

These conditions are often discussed in the context of chemical imbalances in the body, so they can be considered chemical entities in a broad sense. Therefore, they are the only valid entities in the paragraph."}
