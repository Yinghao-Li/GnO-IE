Other entities such as \"S\", \"A conduction through two pathways\", \"first with 2 / 1 block the second having 0 . 12 - 0 . 14 s longer conduction time\", and \"proposed for the explanation of the alternating P - P interval and other electrocardiographic features\" do not refer to diseases but rather describe the context or the proposed explanation for the observed electrocardiographic findings."}
