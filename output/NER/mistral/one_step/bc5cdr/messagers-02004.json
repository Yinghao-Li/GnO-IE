Therefore, the valid entity is \"Fluoxetine-induced reduction\" if it is specified in context. If the reduction is a symptom or complication of a disease, then that disease would also be a valid entity. However, without additional context, it is impossible to determine if a disease is being referred to in the paragraph."}
