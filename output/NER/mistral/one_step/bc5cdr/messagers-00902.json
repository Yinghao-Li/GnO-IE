Therefore, it is considered a disease entity. \"ECG monitoring\" is a diagnostic procedure and not a disease, so it is not included in the table. Additionally, \"short duration\" and \"three consecutive days\" are not diseases, but rather descriptors of the frequency and duration of the documented ST elevation."}
