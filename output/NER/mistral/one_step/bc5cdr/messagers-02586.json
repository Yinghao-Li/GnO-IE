LDLr (LDL receptor) is a protein as well, but it's mentioned in relation to increased levels of its transcript, which can be considered a chemical entity. However, since the paragraph does not specify the exact chemical nature of the increased transcript, it's best to exclude it from the table to maintain precision."}
