Alpha-bungarotoxin binding is a laboratory technique used to measure the presence and function of nicotinic receptors, not a disease itself."}

The latter is a toxin produced by the Bungarus genus of snakes, which is commonly used as a research tool to study nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by binding to them."},

The former is a type of receptor, specifically a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The latter is a toxin produced by the Bungarus genus of snakes, which is commonly used as a research tool to study nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by binding to them. Other entities mentioned in the paragraph, such as \"physiological relevance\" and \"binding\", do not refer to specific chemicals and are not included in the table."}
