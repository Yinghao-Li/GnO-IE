Downbeat nystagmus: This is a type of nystagmus, which is a condition characterized by involuntary, rapid, rhythmic movements of the eyes. In downbeat nystagmus, the movements are downward.\n2. Oscillopsia: This is a condition where the patient experiences blurred or oscillating vision, often due to abnormal eye movements.\n3. Carbamazepine-induced downbeat nystagmus and oscillopsia: These are the conditions caused by the use of the medication carbamazepine. The paragraph mentions that the two cases of downbeat nystagmus and oscillopsia are associated with carbamazepine, so it is important to include this information as a separate entity to reflect the causative relationship."},

Carbamazepine-induced downbeat nystagmus and oscillopsia is a condition caused by the use of the medication carbamazepine. Therefore, these entities meet the criteria for being diseases.\n\nOther entities in the paragraph, such as \"cases\" and \"associated with,\" do not refer to diseases and can be removed from the table."}
