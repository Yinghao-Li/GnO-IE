However, they were identified as entities in the original paragraph and are often associated with certain diseases or conditions. For example, IMPase deficiency can lead to various inherited metabolic disorders. MIP synthase inhibition has been linked to certain neurological conditions. Therefore, they are included in the table as potential disease-related entities."}
