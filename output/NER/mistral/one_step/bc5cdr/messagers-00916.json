Tonic inhibition of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons by 5-HT: This is a condition where the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are inhibited by 5-HT.\n2. Haloperidol catalepsy: This is a condition characterized by rigidity and immobility, often observed as a side effect of antipsychotic medication like haloperidol.\n3. Dexamphetamine stereotypy: This is a condition characterized by repetitive, involuntary, and stereotyped movements, often observed as a side effect of psychostimulant medication like dexamphetamine."},
