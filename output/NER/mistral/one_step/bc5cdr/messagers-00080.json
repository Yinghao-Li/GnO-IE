Pharmacological stress: This refers to the use of medications to induce a stress response in the body, in this context, to study the effect on the heart.\n2. Left ventricular dysfunction: This is a condition where the left ventricle, the main pumping chamber of the heart, does not function properly.\n3. Coronary artery disease: This is a condition where the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, become narrowed or blocked, leading to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart muscle."},

Pharmacological agents (stress): This refers to the use of medications to induce a stress response in the body, in this context, to study the effect on the heart.\n2. Left ventricular function: This is a property or state of the left ventricle, the main pumping chamber of the heart, which can be affected by various factors including diseases or medications.\n3. Coronary artery disease: This is a condition where the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, become narrowed or blocked, leading to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart muscle. It is not a chemical per se, but it is a disease that can be influenced by various chemical factors."}
