However, the paragraph does not explicitly mention the word \"depression\" as a disease entity. Therefore, we can only imply that depression is the condition being treated by the antidepressant trazodone. The paragraph also mentions \"5-HT 2A / 2C receptors,\" which are not diseases but rather specific types of receptors in the brain that play a role in various functions, including mood regulation."},

However, since the paragraph specifically mentions \"5-HT 2A / 2C receptor antagonist,\" it implies that the focus is on the 5-HT as a chemical entity interacting with the receptors, rather than just the neurotransmitter in general. Therefore, it is included in the table."},
