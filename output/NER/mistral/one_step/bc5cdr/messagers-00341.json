    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| None identified in the given paragraph that clearly refer to a disease |\n\nThe paragraph is discussing the resistance of livers from female rats, including pregnant females, to the effects of tetracycline on triglyceride output under experimental conditions. While there is no mention of a specific disease in the paragraph, it is important to note that tetracycline is an antibiotic, and resistance to antibiotics is a common phenomenon. However, the paragraph does not indicate that the rats were suffering from any disease or condition related to their resistance to tetracycline. Therefore, no disease entities can be identified in the paragraph."}
