    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Chemical |\n| --- |\n| morphine |\n| CNSB002 |\n| carrageenan |\n\nIn the given paragraph, \"morphine\" and \"CNSB002\" are the chemical entities mentioned. The paragraph describes the ED50 values for morphine when used in combination with CNSB002, and compares these values to the maximum nonsedating doses in two different models: carrageenan and neuropathy. Therefore, both morphine and CNSB002 are valid chemical entities in this context. Carrageenan is also a chemical, but it is mentioned as a model or substance used in the experiment, rather than a chemical entity of interest, so it is not included in the table."},

The term \"mg / kg\" is a unit of measurement and \"mean\" and \"SEM\" are statistical terms, so they are not considered chemical entities. The terms \"ED50 values\" and \"maximum nonsedating dose\" are pharmacological terms that describe properties of the chemicals, but they are not chemical entities themselves. Therefore, only morphine and CNSB0002 are valid chemical entities in this context."}
