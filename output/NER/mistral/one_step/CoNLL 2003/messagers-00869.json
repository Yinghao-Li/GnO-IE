However, for clarity, we can include \"Australian\" as a person in the table with the name \"The Australian\" or \"Australian player\". The second person, \"Mark Cairns\", is named explicitly, so we include that name in the table. The paragraph also mentions \"Englishman Mark Cairns\", but since \"Englishman\" is a descriptive term and not a separate person, we only include \"Mark Cairns\" in the table."},
