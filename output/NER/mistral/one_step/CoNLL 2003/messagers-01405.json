The phrase \"gets a boost\" could refer to an increase in popularity or demand for plastic surgery in Brazil, rather than a specific person. However, since the context is not clear, it's best to assume that the implied subject of the sentence is \"people\" or \"doctors specializing in plastic surgery\" who are experiencing the boost."}
