However, without additional context, it is unclear if \"Defenders\" refers to a specific organization or a collective term for the individuals mentioned. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution and verify the context before assuming \"Defenders\" as an organization entity. If \"Defenders\" is indeed an organization, then it should be considered as a valid entity. If not, then no organization entity exists in the paragraph."}
