Therefore, it is not included in the table. Similarly, the term \"MP\" refers to a type of organization member (Member of Parliament), but it is not mentioned as a specific organization. The term \"seat\" refers to a position or role within the parliament, not an organization itself. Therefore, they are not included in the table. The term \"quit\" refers to an action taken by an individual, not an organization. Therefore, \"resigned the whip\" is not an organization and is not included in the table."}
