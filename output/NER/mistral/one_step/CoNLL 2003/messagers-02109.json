Since the paragraph states that \"Italy evacuates\" the nuns and priests, it implies that Italy is the one performing the action. The nuns and priests are the entities being evacuated. Therefore, we list \"Italy\" as the person and \"17 nuns and priests\" as a single entity, which we then split into two separate rows in the table for clarity."},
