Feyenoord is the specific club mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Wednesday and Udinese are also mentioned as specific clubs, but it's important to note that Wednesday is a football club based in Sheffield, England, known as Sheffield Wednesday. However, the paragraph does not provide enough context to determine if the \"Wednesday\" mentioned is Sheffield Wednesday or another Wednesday club. Since the paragraph only mentions \"Wednesday\" and \"Udinese\" in relation to Blinker's ban, it's best to present them as general entities without specifying their exact locations.\n3.
