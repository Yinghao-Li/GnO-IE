    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Person |\n| --- |\n| Shops and businesses |\n\nIn this paragraph, the only entity that can be considered as a person is \"shops and businesses\" as a collective group. However, it's important to note that this interpretation might depend on the specific context and the intention of the author. In general, businesses can be considered as legal entities, but they are not physical persons. But in this context, the paragraph is not describing businesses as legal entities, but rather as a collective group of entities that can be closed or opened. Therefore, it's a common usage to refer to them as \"shops and businesses\" as a shorthand for the people who own, manage, or work in those shops and businesses. So, in this specific context, the interpretation of \"shops and businesses\" as a collective group of persons is valid."}
