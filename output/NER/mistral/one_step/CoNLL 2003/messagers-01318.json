The first one is \"Norilsk,\" which is explicitly stated as the organization in question. The second organization is described as \"the world's second-largest nickel producer,\" which refers to Norilsk Nickel, the Russian mining and metallurgical company that is the second-largest producer of nickel in the world. However, since the paragraph only mentions \"Norilsk\" by name, I have included only that organization in the table."},

Therefore, only \"Norilsk\" should be included in the table."}
