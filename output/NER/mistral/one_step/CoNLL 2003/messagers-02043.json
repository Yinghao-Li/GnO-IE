However, if we assume that \"roughly 100 lots\" refers to a group of people or entities each trading a lot (a standardized quantity of a commodity), then we could potentially consider interpreting this as \"roughly 100 traders\" or \"roughly 100 trading entities\". However, without more context, it is difficult to be certain about the exact identity of these entities, so I have chosen to leave them unidentified in this analysis."},
