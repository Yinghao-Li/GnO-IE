The first entity is a person description, so we write it as \"the first woman\". The second entity is a job title, but it is modified by the article \"first\" and the determiner \"the\", so we write it as \"Secretary of State\". The third entity \"with the United States\" is not a person, but rather a prepositional phrase indicating the nationality or affiliation of the person holding the Secretary of State position."},

The other entity \"Secretary of State with the United States\" is not a person, but rather a job title and a nationality or affiliation indicator. Therefore, we only include \"the first woman\" in the table."}
