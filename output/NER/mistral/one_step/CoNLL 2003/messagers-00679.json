In order to identify the \"Person\" entities, I assumed that the names of the cities are proper nouns and should be considered as entities. The numbers are not considered as entities since they are likely just identifying numbers for the teams. However, since the paragraph mentions \"Freiburg 0\", it is clear that \"Freiburg\" is also a city and should be considered a person entity. Therefore, the entities are \"Karlsruhe 3\", \"Reich 29th\", \"Carl\", \"44th\", \"Dundee\", and \"Freiburg\".\n\nHowever, since the paragraph only mentions the teams from Karlsruhe and Dundee, and it is not clear which person from those teams is named \"Carl\" or \"44th\", I added \"(Carl)\" and \"(44th)\" in parentheses to indicate that these entities might not refer to specific persons but rather to the teams themselves. If more context was provided, it might be possible to determine if \"Carl\" and \"44th\" refer to specific persons.\n\nIf we assume that \"Carl\" and \"44th\" do refer to specific persons, then the table would look like this:\n\n| Person |\n|--------|\n| Karlsruhe 3 |\n| Reich 29th |\n| Carl |\n| 44th |\n| Dundee |\n| 69th (Dundee) |\n\nIf we assume that \"Carl\" and \"44th\" do not refer to specific persons but rather to the teams themselves, then the table would look like this:\n\n| Person |\n|--------|\n| Karlsruhe 3 |\n| Reich 29th |\n| Carl (team) |\n| 44th (team) |\n| Dundee |\n| 69th (Dundee) |"}

However, since the original paragraph only mentions it as part of the location name for the score \"Karlsruhe 3 - Freiburg 0\", it is included as a valid location entity."}
