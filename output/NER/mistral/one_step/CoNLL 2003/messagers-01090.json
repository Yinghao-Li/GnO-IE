The mentioned entity \"May\" is identified as a month, which can be considered an organization in some contexts, such as a calendar organization. However, it is important to note that the context of the paragraph does not provide enough information to confirm that \"May\" is an organization in the traditional sense, such as a company or institution. But since the question asks for organizations, I have included \"May\" as a potential organization in the table."}
