The paragraph also mentions \"clashes in September,\" but it does not explicitly state where these clashes took place. However, since the meeting followed these clashes, it is reasonable to assume that the location of the clashes is the same as the location of the meeting, which is Washington in this case. Therefore, we can identify \"Washington\" as the location entity in the paragraph. The mention of \"September\" is not a location, but rather a time frame, so it is not included in the table."},
