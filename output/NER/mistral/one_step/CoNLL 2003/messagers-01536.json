The small group of developing nations and WTO officials are groups, not persons. However, the paragraph mentions \"had pressured WTO officials,\" implying that there are persons within the group who exerted this pressure. Since the paragraph does not provide the names of these individuals, it is not possible to include them in the table. Hansenne is the person being referred to as the one who was prevented from taking the platform to urge such links."},
