Therefore, it has been removed from the table.\n\nThe remaining entity, \"Yr Ago,\" represents \"Last Year,\" which could be considered a location in a broad sense, as it refers to a specific point in time in the previous year. However, it is not a physical location in the way that a city, country, or address would be. Therefore, it is included in the table for completeness, but with the understanding that it is a somewhat ambiguous location entity."}

Other abbreviations like \"YTD Yr Ago\" and \"Curr Wk\" are compound phrases that describe the relationship between different organizations, rather than separate organizations themselves."}
