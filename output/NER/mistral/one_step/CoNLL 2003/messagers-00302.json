However, the paragraph does not explicitly state which team he plays for, so we cannot be certain which organization to attribute to him beyond \"cricket team.\" Therefore, we attribute him to the more general \"cricket\" organization.\n* \"Shane Warne\" is explicitly identified as a cricket player and a fielder, so we can attribute him to the cricket organization."}
