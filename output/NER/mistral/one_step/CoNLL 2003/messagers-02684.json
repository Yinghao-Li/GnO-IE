The first one is a rate of speed, but it is often referred to as a location in the context of physics problems, where the position of an object at different points in time is described. The second one is a numerical value, which could potentially represent a location if it refers to a specific address or coordinate, but without additional context, it is difficult to determine if that is the case. However, given the context of the paragraph, it is more likely that it represents a jump in a sequence or a value in a data set, rather than a physical location."},

It is a command or instruction to approach a problem in a systematic way. Similarly, \"145.4 / second jump 158\" can be interpreted as a rate of change (145.4 seconds per second) or a jump in a sequence (from 145.4 to 158), but in the context of the paragraph, it is more likely to be interpreted as a rate of change, which is a type of location in physics problems where the position of an object at different points in time is described. Therefore, it is included in the table as a location."}
