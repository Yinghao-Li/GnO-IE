Each set of numbers can be broken down into four parts using hyphens as separators. The first part before the first hyphen refers to a rating agency report, and the remaining parts likely refer to specific report numbers or identifiers. However, without additional context, it is not clear which organizations these reports belong to beyond their names being implied by the use of \"Moody,\" \"Blewett,\" and \"Warne.\" Therefore, these names are the only valid organizations mentioned in the paragraph."}
