These results are explained by their much more planar conformations in the solid state. 10 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram of PCZDTB and PQCDTB , which were measured in 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate acetonitrile. As reported by Lidzey et al. , the PCZDTB oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potential were + 1.09 and -1.37 V , respectively , and the HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.44 and -2.98 eV. In the case of PQCDTB , unlike the PQA2T ( poly[quinacridone-bithiophene] ) reported by Takimiya et al. , a clear oxidation - reduction peak was observed. 19 This type of result has been obtained because PQCDTB was D-A structured , unlike the typical p - type structure of PQA2T. In PQCDTB , the oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potentials were + 0.89 and -1.36 V , respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.24 and -2.99 eV , respectively. Table 2 summarizes the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers. As shown in Table 2 , the HOMO level of PQCDTB ( -5.24 eV ) was higher than that of PCZDTB by 0.2 eV because the HOMO level of the QC derivative was higher than that of carbazole. The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference between the HOMO energy levels and the optical bandgap energies. According to the calculations , the LUMO levels of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were -3.32 and -3.46 eV , respectively. They slightly differed from the levels calculated through CV , but they mostly exhibited a similar tendency. Figure 4 shows the band diagram of the energy levels that have been obtained through DFT calculations and experiments. The bandgap energies of PQCDTB and PCZDTB determined through UV - vis spectra were reported as 1.98 and 1.92 eV , respectively , which were lower than the results of the DFT calculation by 0.57 and 0.55 V. 28 Because the HOMO level is lower than the P3HT HOMO level ( -4.9 eV ) in both polymers , a relatively high air stability could be obtained. 29 In the case of PQCDTB , the LUMO level ( -3.32 eV ) was higher than the PC71BM LUMO level ( -4.0 eV ) by 0.68 eV. However , the HOMO level ( -5.24 eV ) was lower than the PEDOT : PSS HOMO level ( -5.0 eV ) by 0.24 eV. Therefore , if charge separation occurs after receiving light energy , a hole would exhibit more effective charge transport than an electron in the active layer of PQCDTB. 14,26 Figure 5 and Table 3 show the results of evaluating the characteristics of an OPV device.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
