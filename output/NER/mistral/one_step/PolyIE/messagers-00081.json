The energy levels of the copolymers are lower than those of other heteroarene - based DPP copolymers reported previously , [21][22][23][24][25][26] and their low - lying HOMO energy levels are expected to afford high V OC s of the polymer solar cells. The crystal properties of the copolymers were investigated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ). The two copolymers clearly showed a characteristic diffraction peak in the range of 3-5 ° with a weak diffraction peak in the range of 15-20 ° which are associated with ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) diffraction , respectively ( Fig. 2a ) , indicating that both copolymers form a crystalline lamellar structure in the thin film state. It should be noted here that these copolymers exhibit distinct X-ray diffraction without any thermal treatment. Both copolymers exhibit a sharp and intense ( 100 ) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.2 ° corresponding to the interchain distance ( d 100 ) of 21.0 Å , while the ( 010 ) diffraction peak was observed at 19.4 ° for PTATDPP and 19.1 ° for PTAFDPP , corresponding to the π-π stacking distance ( d 010 ) of 4.6 Å and 4.7 Å , respectively. For identifying the reason for high crystallinity of the copolymers , the density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation for the minimum energy conformations of the copolymers was performed to reveal the difference of the dihedral angle between the TA and DPP units in the copolymers. To simplify the calculation , one repeating unit of each polymer was used as the model compound , and long alkyl substituents were replaced by the ethyl group. As shown in Fig. 2b , TA and TDPP have a coplanar structure with a dihedral angle smaller than 1 ° while TA and FDPP have a slightly distorted structure with a dihedral angle of 3.8 ° . This difference of the dihedral angle between PTATDPP and PTAFDPP accounts for the difference of d 010 , and thus , PTATDPP is expected to form a more closely - packed lamellar structure than PTAFDPP. To investigate the charge transporting characteristics of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP , bottom-gate and top - contact fieldeffect transistors ( FETs ) were fabricated. Both copolymers clearly exhibit current modulation and saturation with unipolar p - type field - effect charge transporting behavior , as shown in Fig. 3. The calculated saturation hole mobilities ( μ h ) for PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are 2.7 × 10^-2 and 8.9 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , with high on / off ratios ( > 10^5 ) and low threshold voltages ( < 20 V ).\n\nLet's think step by step."},
