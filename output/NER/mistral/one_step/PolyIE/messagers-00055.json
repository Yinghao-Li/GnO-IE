The optical properties of these random terpolymers can be easily controlled by tuning the ratio between DPP and TPD ; an increase in TPD induced increased absorption between 400 and 650 nm and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level , while higher DPP contents resulted in stronger absorption between 600 and 900 nm. The best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.33% was obtained from PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 with [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) due to the improved light absorption and thus a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) higher than 16 mA / cm^2.

Density functional theory calculations showed that the small portions of strong electron - withdrawing DPP in PBDTT-DPP25-TPD75 and PBDTT-DPP10-TPD90 could provide trap sites , which suppress efficient charge transfer.
