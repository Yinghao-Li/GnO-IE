The Al electrode was removed by dipping the devices for 1 min in a mixed acid solution containing of 16 mL of concentrated phosphoric acid , 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid , 1 mL of acetic acid , and 2 mL of D 2 O. The blend films showed almost equivalently measured smooth surfaces ( according to their root-mean-square ( rms ) roughness ) with small degrees of phase separation. The rms roughness of the active layers were 0.49 nm for PFDTBT , 0.44 nm for PFDTBT-10Per , 0.51 nm for PFD2TBT , and 0.50 nm for PFD2TBT-10Per , respectively. This result suggests that the morphologies of all the active films are very similar , so that such a property will not affect the J sc of the photovoltaic devices. Therefore , the improvement of PCE and J sc in the fabricated photovoltaic devices is derived from the enhanced π-π interaction between polymers that results from the introduction of perylene units . We introduced perylene units into PFDTBT and PFD2TBT to enhance the interchain π-π interaction. The optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized copolymers showed were slight modification upon perylene addition. Interestingly , the field - effect mobility of the TFTs , using the polymers as the active layer increased with an increasing perylene content in the copolymers. The short circuit currents of the photovoltaic devices fabricated using the polymers as an electron donor , also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased , which is consistent with the field - effect mobility results of the polymers. We conclude that the introduction of perylene to the conjugated polymer chain enhances the π-π interaction between polymer chains and improves its charge - transport ability , leading to increases short circuit currents in the photovoltaic devices .
