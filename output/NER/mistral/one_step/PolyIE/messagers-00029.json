The corresponding PCE is 4.12% , about 37% higher than that obtained from a PCDTBT - based reference device. This work provides a feasible strategy for selective fine - tuning of LUMO levels , which achieves a high J SC value , while nearly remaining a high V OC . Therefore , further exploration of PCDSeBT - based PSCs is still warranted for high - performance PCEs by means of controlling the film morphology and improving electric contacts .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
