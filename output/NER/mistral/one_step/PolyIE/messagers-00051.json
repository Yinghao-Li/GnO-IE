To our surprise , P3 with three solubilizing n-alkyl groups also has poor solubility probably due to strong interchain interactions. Replacing n-dodecyl in P3 with 2-decyltetradecyl group significantly enhance solubility of P4. P5 and P6 also have good solubility. Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using polystyrene standards as calibrants. The polymers P1 and P4-P6 show numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) of 12^250 , 9934 , 5714 , and 10^053 , with polydispersity indices ( M w / M n ) of 1.30 , 1.43 , 1.71 , and 1.56 , respectively ( Table 1 ). The GPC measurements for P2 and P3 are not carried out due to their low solubility. The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) under nitrogen ( Figure 2 ). The decomposition temperature ( T d ) at 5% weight loss for P3-P6 are above 330 °C , while P1 and P2 exhibit lower Td(below 300 °C ) ( Table 1 ). Optical Properties. The UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of P1-P6 were measured in CHCl 3 ( ca. 10^-6 M ) solution and in thin films , and the results are red - shifted 88 and 112 nm respectively , relative to monomer 4b ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ) due to increased conjugation. Compared to homopolymer P6 , all copolymers P1-P5 exhibit red - shifted absorptions and smaller optical bandgaps in solution and in film. Broad absorption bands located in the visible region were observed for the solution and film of P1 ( Figure 4 ). The absorbance maximum for P1 in solution is 496 nm. The absorption spectrum of P1 in film exhibits red - shift and distinct shoulder peak at ca. 540 nm , which are probably related to the formation of molecular aggregates owing to the strong interchain interactions. The absorption maxima of P2 in solution and in film are red - shifted 14 and 32 nm relative to that of P1 , respectively , thanks to its more planar conformation and increased conjugation. P3 and P4 exhibit almost same absorption profile in solution and in film. Compared to P1 and P2 , P3 and P4 exhibit relatively narrow and blue - shifted absorption band in solution and in film. P5 in solution and in film exhibits absorbance maxima at 503 and 524 nm , which are shifted 20 nm to the red relative to those of P4 , suggesting a more planar conformation. The trend in emission spectra of P1-P6 in solution and in film resembles that in their absorption spectra.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
