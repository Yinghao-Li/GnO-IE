The PSC based on J91 / m-ITIC as an active layer with thermal annealing gave a high PCE of 11.63% with a high V oc of 0.98 V and a J sc of 18.03 mA cm^-2 . 36 The improved cell performance was attributed to the suppression of carrier recombination imposed by the difluorosubstituted side chain. In addition to influencing molecular and functional properties of donor polymers , the structural modification could lead to severe aggregation , which could hamper solution processability of a polymer. On the other hand , aggregation could be desirable and provide a useful tool to control the bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) film morphology and then the photovoltaic performance of a solar cell. Yan and co-workers employed the branched alkyl chains attached on the backbone of the difluorobenzothiadiazole-quaterthiophene ( PffBT4T ) copolymer to acquire desirable temperature - dependent aggregation behavior. By spin - casting the polymer solution at an elevated temperature , they could control the morphology and crystallinity of the polymer films. Taking advantage of this aggregation control approach , high - performance PSCs based on PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM were fabricated affording a PCE of up to 10.8% . 9 Guo and co-workers used a number of fused thiophene spacers to tune the aggregation behavior of difluorobenzoxadiazole (ffBX)-based donor polymers among which PffBX-TT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as a spacer showed intermediate temperature - dependent aggregation strength allowing the control of blend film morphology during PSC fabrication. PSCs using PffBX-TT:PC71BM as an active layer gave a maximum PCE of 9.10% . 37 Previously , we developed a class of benzodithiophene - based donor polymers with fluoro-dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole being an acceptor unit that showed interesting temperature - dependent aggregation behavior when equipped with linear alkyl side chains. PSCs based on these polymers : PC71BM blend layers showed good photovoltaic performance with a maximum PCE as high as 9.70% . 38 In this contribution , we reported a new series of donor polymer materials based on benzodithiophene ( BDT ) and difluorinated dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole , PffBB-n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16 ) , which exhibited strong aggregation behavior in both solution and thin films. In addition to the size of alkyl side chains attached on the backbone of the polymer , aggregation can be modulated by the solvent used and temperature applied on the film with which the absorption cut - off extended down to ∼ 780 nm in thin films , resulting in a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Such wide absorption is desirable and complementary to that of the commonly used PC71BM acceptor material in the visible light region , which can increase light harvesting in BHJ PSCs.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
