The decrease in both the J sc and FF could be due to inferior polymer chain packing in the active layer leading to a poor charge transporting network. Besides , the device performance generally varied with the length of alkyl side chains attached onto the polymer backbone. The device efficiency initially increases upon the incorporation of longer alkyl side chains from decyl to tetradecyl reaching a maximum at tetradecyl-substituted PffBB-14 and then declines with further alkyl side chain extension. Importantly , such chain Article length - dependent device performance trend is spin - coating temperature independent. The champion PffBB-14 - based device affords the highest PCE of 9.93% with a V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36% . The size of the alkyl side chain is known to affect the processability and interchain interactions of a polymer , which would provide a tool to optimize the π-π stacking interactions of a polymer in the solid state. A size - optimized alkyl side chain would provide a good balance between the π-π stacking interactions of the polymer backbone and the alkyl-alkyl side chain interactions resulting in a highly ordered molecular packing for efficient charge transport. Figure 5a shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of PffBB-n / PC71BM - based PSCs. Strong and broad photo - to - current responses were observed in the range from 330 to 780 nm in all of these PSCs , in which the absorption above 650 nm was attributed to the polymer aggregationinduced absorption broadening. Remarkably , the PffBB-14based device exhibited a much higher photoconversion Article response ranging from 350 to 500 nm than those of other devices , thus affording the highest J sc among all of these devices. As PffBB-n polymers showed similar absorption properties , the high current density of PffBB-14 - based PSC would result from well - ordered polymer : PC71BMnetwork / packing. J sc derived from the EQE spectra were estimated to be 14.12 , 14.92 , 16.29 , and 14.21 mA cm^-2 for PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based devices , respectively , which were in good agreement with those obtained from J-V characterization ( Figure 6 ). Charge Transfer and Recombination. The charge carrier mobilities of PffBB-n - based devices were estimated on hole - only and electron - only devices using the space - chargelimited current ( SCLC ) model , and the results are summarized in Table 4. Indeed , the highest and well - balanced charge carrier mobility of the PffBB-14:PC71BM blend affords a higher J sc and FF than those of other devices. Charge dissociation probability was characterized by photogenerated current density ( J ph ) vs effective applied voltage ( V eff ) measurements.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
