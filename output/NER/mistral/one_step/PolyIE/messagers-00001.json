The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the resulting polymers , PBT and PTT , were substantially stabilized when compared to those of the parent P3HT. Such energy level lowering was attributed to the integration of carboxylate and vinylene groups giving rise to a push - pull structural motif , resulting in an enhanced PCE of the PV devices based on them. 21 Over the years , the use of the structural effect to enhance PSC performance has been extensively investigated , particularly the donor - acceptor ( D-A ) strategy , which has been proved to be an effective approach to develop donor polymers with wide absorption , low - lying energy levels , and enhanced electron properties. 23-32 Besides , conjugation expansion on the polymer backbone is an alternative tool to improve the electronic properties of polymers. By replacing a branched 2ethylhexyl side chain with a linear n-octyl group , Zhang and his co-workers synthesized a PTB7-Th derivative namely , PBTT.

Such dramatic enhancement in efficiency was attributed to a higher charge mobility and improved morphology of the PBTT : IEICO blend film induced by the less steric hindered linear alkyl side chain. 1 Yang and coworkers used selenophene to replace thiophene π-bridge in the indacenodithiophene (IDT)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD)-based copolymer ( PThBDDIDT ) to develop a donor-π-acceptor type copolymer , PSeBDDIDT. The PCE of solar cells based on polymer : PC71BM as an active layer was dramatically increased from 7.04 to 8.65% , respectively.
