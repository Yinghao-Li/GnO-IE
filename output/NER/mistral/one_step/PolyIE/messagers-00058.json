P5 , P6 , and P7 blended with PC61BM showed higher PCE values than when they were blended with PC71BM in spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , which is most likely due to the lower miscibility of those polymers with PC71BM. 44 The V OC of these random terpolymers increased in the order P2 ( 0.74 V ) ∼ P3 ( 0.74 V ) < P4 ( 0.76 V ) < P5 ( 0.79 V ) < P6 ( 0.82 V ). The trend in the V OC of the PSCs can be explained by the HOMO energy level of the polymers because the V OC is typically linearly proportional to the difference in energy between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor. 45 However , the PCE of the random terpolymers showed a the nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6% in the order P3 ( 5.61% ) > P4 ( 5.26% ) > P2 ( 4.91% ) > P5 ( 3.02% ) > P6 ( 2.09% ) ; this was consistent with the observed trend of the J SC .
