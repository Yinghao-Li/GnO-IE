PFDTBT showed a maximum PCE of 2.2% , and PFDTBT derivatives containing branched alkyl chains ( BisDMO - PFDTBT ) showed higher PCEs. 10,11 Some molecules and polymers that have flat structures such as fluorene , 12-16 anthracene , 17 and pyrene 18,19 have been reported to form excimers or aggregates by strong interchain π-π interactions. Excimer formation could affect the emission properties of molecules or polymers , therefore , the excimer or exciplex formation has been used as a fluorescence probe for molecular recognition. 19 In organic photovoltaic devices , π-π interactions between low - band gap donor polymers are important for charge transportation. Enhanced π-π interactions in p - type donor polymers could improve their chargetransport ability , and thus increase short - circuit currents in solar cells. In this study we report on a new approach to improve PCE of OPVs by enhancing the interchain π-π interaction. To do this we introduced flat perylene units into the conjugated polymers. We synthesized poly[2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] ( PFDTBT ) , poly[2,2′-(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)dithiophene-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] ( PFD2TBT ) , and their ter-polymers with perylene units.
