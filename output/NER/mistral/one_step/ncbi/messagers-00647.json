However, the focus is on the diseases associated with these mutations.\n* \"development of multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinoma\" refers to the growth of multiple benign and malignant tumors in the colon and rectum.\n* \"classical FAP\" is a specific type or phenotype of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, characterized by the presence of numerous polyps in the colon and rectum.\n* \"colorectal cancer risk in the general population\" refers to the increased likelihood of developing colorectal cancer in the general population due to the presence of these germ-line variants of the APC gene.\n* \"colorectal cancer\" is the malignant tumor that can develop as a result of these genetic mutations."}
