The former refers to a specific type of genetic mechanism that increases the transmission of certain alleles during meiosis in DM, while the latter refers to a specific genetic condition characterized by an expansion of CTG repeats at the DM locus."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Meiotic drive in DM |\n| CTGn repeat expansion at the DM locus |\n\nThese are the only entities in the paragraph that clearly refer to diseases or genetic conditions. \"DM\" likely refers to a specific genetic disorder, but without additional context, it is not possible to determine which one. However, \"meiotic drive\" is a specific type of genetic mechanism that can be associated with certain genetic disorders, and \"CTGn repeat expansion at the DM locus\" is a specific genetic condition."}
