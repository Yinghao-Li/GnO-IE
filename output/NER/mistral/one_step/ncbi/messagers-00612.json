    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Dominant-negative mutants of PAX6 |\n\nThe paragraph discusses the effects of dominant-negative mutants, which are a type of genetic mutation. In this context, the mutations are associated with the PAX6 gene. While PAX6 mutations are not explicitly referred to as a disease, they can lead to various eye conditions, such as aniridia or Waardenburg syndrome, depending on the specific mutation. Therefore, the dominant-negative mutants of PAX6 can be considered a type of genetic disease."}
