It discusses a genetic finding related to HLA haplotypes and recent admixture in Australian Aboriginal samples. HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) is a complex of proteins on the surface of human cells that plays a role in the immune system, but it is not considered a disease itself. Admixture refers to the genetic mixing of different population groups, which is not a disease either."}
