    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Normal sodium channel function |\n| Sodium channel with missense mutation (faster recovery from inactivation) |\n| Sodium channel with frameshift mutation (non-functional) |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Normal\" refers to the normal functioning sodium channel, which is not considered a disease.\n* \"Missense mutation\" and \"frameshift mutation\" describe specific types of genetic mutations. A missense mutation results in the substitution of one amino acid for another, while a frameshift mutation leads to a shift in the reading frame of the genetic code. These mutations can cause diseases, depending on their location and impact on the protein function. In this context, the missense mutation causes the sodium channel to recover from inactivation more rapidly than normal, while the frameshift mutation makes the sodium channel non-functional. Therefore, these entities are considered diseases in the context of the paragraph."}
