Severe early-onset obesity: The term \"severe early-onset obesity\" refers to a condition characterized by excessive body weight gain from an early age.\n2. Adrenal insufficiency: This is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, leading to various symptoms.\n3. POMC mutations: POMC (Pro-opiomelanocortin) is a precursor protein that gives rise to several hormones and melanocyte-stimulating factors. Mutations in this gene can lead to various conditions, including obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair pigmentation."},

Therefore, it was not included in the table as a separate disease entity."}
