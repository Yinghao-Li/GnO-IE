However, this mutation is known to be associated with a condition called hemochromatosis, which is caused by the malabsorption of iron due to the dysfunction of the HFE protein. Therefore, hemochromatosis could be considered an indirectly mentioned disease in this context. However, since the paragraph does not explicitly mention hemochromatosis, it is not included in the table above to avoid any potential confusion or misinterpretation."},

While hemochromatosis is a condition related to this mutation, the paragraph does not explicitly mention the disease itself. Therefore, only the C282Y mutation is considered a valid disease entity in this context."}
