The term \"disease\" is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but the context suggests that the genetic variations being discussed may be associated with various diseases. Therefore, the table includes \"genetic heterogeneity with a relative high percentage of splice-site mutations\" as the disease entity."}
