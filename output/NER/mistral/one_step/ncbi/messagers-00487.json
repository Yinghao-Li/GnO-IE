The analysis revealed that the mutated precursor was synthesized normally but not phosphorylated or secreted, and the mature lysosomal alpha-subunit was not detected. However, there is no mention of a specific disease entity in the paragraph."},

The analysis showed that the mutated precursor was synthesized normally but not phosphorylated or secreted, and the mature lysosomal alpha-subunit was not detected. While the paragraph mentions the genetic mutation, it does not explicitly state that it is associated with a specific disease. Therefore, no disease entity can be identified with certainty based on the information provided in the paragraph."}
