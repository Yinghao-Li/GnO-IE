Hypermethylation is a molecular change that can occur in genes and is not considered a disease in and of itself. It can be a contributing factor to various diseases, but it is not a disease itself. Therefore, no diseases are mentioned in the paragraph."},

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "| Disease |\n| --- |\n| Hypermethylated DMPK gene |\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"a hypermethylated DMPK gene,\" which is the only entity that can be considered a potential disease condition, as it is described as a \"significant reduction\" in comparison to normal genes. However, it's important to note that hypermethylation itself is not a disease, but it can be a contributing factor to various diseases. Therefore, the valid disease entity in this paragraph is \"hypermethylated DMPK gene.\""}
