Therefore, we can only identify the disease as an unspecified disease.

The paragraph does not provide any information about monozygotic or dizygotic twins that do not have the disease, so there is no need to include \"healthy\" or \"non-diseased\" as entities. Additionally, \"MZ\" and \"DZ\" refer to types of twins, not diseases, so they should not be included as entities either."}
