The \"chromosome 10q23 deletion\" is a specific characteristic or marker of certain types of prostate tumors, and can be considered a subtype or complication of the primary disease entity. Therefore, both the general disease entity (prostate tumors) and the specific disease marker (chromosome 10q23 deletion) should be included in the table."}
