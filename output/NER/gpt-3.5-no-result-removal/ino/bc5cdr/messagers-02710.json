It is an enzyme involved in apoptosis, which is a type of programmed cell death.\n\n2. STZ treated rat: STZ stands for streptozotocin, which is a chemical compound used to induce diabetes in animal models. While diabetes is a disease, it is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n3. Apoptotic cell death: Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death, but it is not a specific disease.\n\n4. Hippocampus and cortex: These are regions of the brain and not diseases.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
