Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to identify the \"Disease\" entities.\n\n1. \"She\" - This is a pronoun and does not refer to a disease.\n\n2. \"infused\" - This is a verb and does not refer to a disease.\n\n3. \"three units\" - This phrase does not refer to a disease. It indicates a quantity.\n\n4. \"packed cells\" - This refers to a medical product used in transfusions, specifically packed red blood cells. While it is not a disease itself, it may be related to a disease or medical condition.\n\n5. \"session\" - This is a noun and does not refer to a disease.\n\n6. \"hemodialysis\" - This refers to a medical procedure used to filter waste and excess fluid from the blood in individuals with kidney failure. While it is not a disease itself, it is related to a medical condition.\n\nBased on the analysis, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the paragraph. However, the mention of \"packed cells\" and \"hemodialysis\" suggests that the context may be related to a medical condition or disease."},
