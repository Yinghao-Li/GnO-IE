Cardiac total antioxidant performance (TAP): This is not a chemical entity. It refers to a measurement or performance related to antioxidants in the cardiac system.\n\n2. DNA damage: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to damage to the DNA molecule.\n\n3. Morphology analyses: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the analysis of the shape, structure, and form of something, in this case, it could be cells or tissues.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no specific chemical entities mentioned."},
