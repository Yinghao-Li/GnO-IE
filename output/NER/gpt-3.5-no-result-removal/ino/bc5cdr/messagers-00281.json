Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph.\n\n1. dl-sotalol: This is a drug used to treat certain heart rhythm disorders, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. It is not a disease.\n\n2. azimilide: This is also a drug used to treat certain heart rhythm disorders. It is not a disease.\n\n3. EADs (Early Afterdepolarizations): These are abnormal electrical impulses that can occur in the heart and can lead to arrhythmias. EADs are not a specific disease but rather a phenomenon associated with certain heart conditions.\n\n4. QT prolongation: This refers to a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), which can be a sign of an increased risk for arrhythmias. QT prolongation is not a disease but rather a characteristic of certain heart conditions.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"Disease\" entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
