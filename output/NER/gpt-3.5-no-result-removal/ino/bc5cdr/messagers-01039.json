It is a measurement parameter.\n5. dentate gyrus - This is not a chemical entity. It is a brain structure.\n6. IML - This is not a chemical entity. It stands for \"inner molecular layer,\" which is a brain layer.\n7. rats - This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the animal species.\n8. status epilepticus - This is not a chemical entity.
