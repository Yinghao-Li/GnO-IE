The paragraph mainly discusses disease activity markers and various diagnostic techniques such as signs of ocular inflammation, evidence of retinal vasculitis, Swedish interactive threshold algorithm - short wavelength automated perimetry Humphrey visual field analysis, electroretinographic parameters, and optical coherence tomography. These are not chemical entities but rather medical terms and diagnostic tools related to ocular diseases.\n\nIf you have any other specific requests or if there is any other information you would like me to assist you with, please let me know!"},
