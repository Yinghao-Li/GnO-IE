It refers to a temporary abnormality in the pupillary response.\n\n2. Denervation supersensitivity: This is not a specific disease entity. It refers to an increased sensitivity of a tissue or organ to a neurotransmitter due to denervation.\n\n3. Abnormal visual-evoked potentials: This is not a specific disease entity. It refers to abnormal electrical responses of the visual system to visual stimuli.\n\n4. Quinine toxicity: Quinine toxicity can be considered as a disease entity. It refers to the harmful effects of consuming or being exposed to excessive amounts of quinine, a medication used to treat malaria.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"quinine toxicity\"."},
