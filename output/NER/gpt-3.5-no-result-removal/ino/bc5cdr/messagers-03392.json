Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph.\n\n1. \"structural damage of podocytes\" - This phrase does not explicitly mention a specific disease. It describes damage to podocytes, which are cells in the kidney. It does not refer to a specific disease entity.\n\n2. \"reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes\" - This phrase does not mention a specific disease. It refers to a reduction in the expression level of genes that are markers for podocytes. It does not refer to a specific disease entity.\n\n3. \"nephrin and podocin\" - These are not diseases but rather specific proteins that are markers for podocytes. They are mentioned in relation to the reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no specific disease entities mentioned."},
