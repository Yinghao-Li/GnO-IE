We cannot determine the specific chemical entity here.\n\n2. 30, 100, 300 mg/kg: These are not chemical entities but rather dosage measurements. They indicate the amount of a substance administered per kilogram of body weight.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific chemical entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
