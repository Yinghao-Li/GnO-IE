However, there are some measurements mentioned, such as \"mean arterial pressure\" and \"mm Hg,\" which are related to physiological parameters. While these measurements are not chemical entities themselves, they are often associated with chemical processes in the body. Therefore, we can consider them as potential chemical entities for further analysis.\n\nStep 2: Filter out irrelevant results.\n\nSince there are no explicit chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph, we do not have any relevant results to include in the table.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThere are no chemical entities identified in the given paragraph."},
