It refers to an excessive accumulation of calcium ions.\n\n2. accelerated beating rhythm - This is not a specific disease entity. It refers to an increased heart rate.\n\n3. arrhythmia - This is a disease entity. It refers to an abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nTherefore, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"arrhythmia\"."},
