ACE inhibitors are a class of medications used to treat various conditions, including high blood pressure, heart failure, and kidney disease.\n\n2. Safer: This is not a disease entity. It refers to the comparative safety of ACE inhibitors compared to other medications.\n\n3. Modify progression of disease: This mentions the term \"disease,\" but it does not specify a particular disease entity.\n\n4. Relieve symptoms: This does not mention a specific disease entity. It refers to the general effect of ACE inhibitors in relieving symptoms associated with certain diseases.\n\n5. Improve exercise tolerance: This does not mention a specific disease entity. It refers to the general effect of ACE inhibitors in improving exercise tolerance in individuals with certain diseases.\n\n6. Reduce mortality: This does not mention a specific disease entity. It refers to the general effect of ACE inhibitors in reducing mortality in individuals with certain diseases.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no specific disease entities mentioned."},
