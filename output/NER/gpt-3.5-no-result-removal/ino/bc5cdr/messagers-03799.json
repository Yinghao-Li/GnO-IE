Let's identify the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph.\n\n1. prostaglandin: This is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n2. synthesis: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to a process.\n\n3. renal: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the kidneys.\n\n4. function: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the purpose or role of something.\n\n5. morphological: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the form or structure of something.\n\n6. integrity: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the state of being whole or undamaged.\n\n7. inhibition: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the act of preventing or restraining something.\n\n8. pathological: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to something related to disease or abnormality.\n\n9. medullary: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the inner region of an organ or tissue.\n\n10. lesions: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to abnormal areas of tissue.\n\n11. deterioration: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the process of becoming worse or less valuable.\n\nSo, the only \"Chemical\" entity in the given paragraph is \"prostaglandin\"."},
