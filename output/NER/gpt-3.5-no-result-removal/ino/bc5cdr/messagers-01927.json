Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph:\n\n1. \"coronary CTA\" - This refers to a medical imaging technique used to visualize the coronary arteries. While it is not a disease itself, it is related to the study of diseases affecting the coronary arteries.\n\n2. \"cocaine-associated chest pain\" - This refers to chest pain that is associated with cocaine use. It is a symptom that can be caused by various underlying conditions, including cardiovascular diseases.\n\nTherefore, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Coronary artery disease (implied by the mention of coronary CTA)\n2. Cocaine-associated chest pain (implied by the mention of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain)\n\nPlease note that the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific diseases, but rather focuses on the investigation of whether a negative coronary CTA can identify a subset of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who can be safely discharged."},
