It refers to a medical condition involving the heart's electrical system.\n\n2. accelerated junctional rhythms - This is not a chemical entity. It refers to a type of abnormal heart rhythm.\n\n3. oral verapamil - This is a chemical entity. Verapamil is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and certain heart conditions.\n\nSo, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"oral verapamil\"."},
