CAA (Chemical): CAA is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Acrolein (Chemical): Acrolein is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n3. Cysteine proteases (Not a chemical): Cysteine proteases are enzymes, not chemical entities.\n4. Caspase-3 (Not a chemical): Caspase-3 is an enzyme, not a chemical entity.\n5. Caspase-8 (Not a chemical): Caspase-8 is an enzyme, not a chemical entity.\n6. Cathepsin B (Not a chemical): Cathepsin B is an enzyme, not a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the identified \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are CAA and acrolein."},
