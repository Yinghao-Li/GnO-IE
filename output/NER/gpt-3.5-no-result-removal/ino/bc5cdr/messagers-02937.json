It refers to a histological staining method that uses Sirius red dye to visualize collagen fibers.\n\n3. off-dosing period - This is not a chemical entity. It refers to a period of time during which a medication or treatment is not administered.\n\nTherefore, there are no chemical entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
