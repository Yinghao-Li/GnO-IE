It refers to mice that have a knockout (KO) of the PKCa gene, which is a gene involved in the protein kinase C alpha pathway. It does not represent a specific disease.\n\n3. urine output: This is not a disease entity. It refers to the amount of urine produced by the mice.\n\n4. urine osmolality: This is not a disease entity. It refers to the concentration of solutes in the urine.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, there are no specific disease entities mentioned."},
