CCK-8: This is a chemical compound, specifically a peptide hormone called cholecystokinin-8.\n2. Saline: This is a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water, commonly used as a control or diluent in experiments.\n3. LTP: This stands for long-term potentiation, which is a cellular mechanism involved in synaptic plasticity in the brain.\n4. Rats: While not a chemical entity, it is mentioned in the context of the experiment.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are CCK-8 and saline."},
