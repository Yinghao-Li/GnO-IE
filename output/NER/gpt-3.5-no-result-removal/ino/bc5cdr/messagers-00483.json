It is an enzyme that is often measured in blood tests to assess muscle damage.\n\n2. CK-MB - This is not a disease entity either. CK-MB is a specific form of creatine kinase that is found mainly in the heart muscle.\n\n3. cardiac troponin I (cTnI) - This is also not a disease entity. Cardiac troponin I is a protein that is released into the bloodstream when there is damage to the heart muscle.\n\nTherefore, there are no disease entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
