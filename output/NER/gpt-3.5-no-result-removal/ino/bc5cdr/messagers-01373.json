Autosomal recessive disorder: This is a general term used to describe the inheritance pattern of Wilson's disease.\n\n3. Hepatic copper metabolism disorder: This refers to the specific aspect of copper metabolism that is affected in Wilson's disease.\n\n4. Copper accumulation and toxicity: This describes the consequence of the disorder, where copper builds up in the body and becomes toxic.\n\n5. Hepatic disorder: This refers to the liver-related symptoms and complications of Wilson's disease.\n\n6. Neurologic disorder: This refers to the neurological symptoms and complications of Wilson's disease.\n\n7. Psychiatric disorder: This refers to the psychiatric symptoms and complications of Wilson's disease.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are: Wilson's disease, autosomal recessive disorder, hepatic copper metabolism disorder, copper accumulation and toxicity, hepatic disorder, neurologic disorder, and psychiatric disorder."},
