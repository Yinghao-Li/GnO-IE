It is a combination of the drug fenoterol and the compound hydrobromide.\n\n2. ritodrin - HCl: This is also a chemical entity. It is a combination of the drug ritodrin and the compound hydrochloride (HCl).\n\n3. placebo: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to a substance with no therapeutic effect, often used as a control in clinical trials.\n\nTherefore, the chemical entities in the paragraph are \"fenoterol - hydrobromide\" and \"ritodrin - HCl\"."},
