It seems to be an abbreviation or acronym specific to the study and its context.\n\n2. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid): This is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n3. Glutamine: This is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n4. Aspartate: This is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n5. Glutathione: This is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n\n6. AChE (acetylcholinesterase): This is not a chemical entity, but an enzyme involved in the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n\nSo, the chemical entities mentioned in the paragraph are GABA, glutamine, aspartate, and glutathione."},
