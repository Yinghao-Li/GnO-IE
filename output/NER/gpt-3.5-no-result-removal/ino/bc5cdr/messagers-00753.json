It stands for \"twice a day\" and refers to the frequency of medication administration.\n\n4. 5 mg: This is a chemical entity. It represents the increased dosage of a medication.\n\n5. 4 weeks: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to a duration of time.\n\n6. diastolic blood pressure: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to a physiological measurement.\n\n7. 90 mmHg: This is not a chemical entity. It refers to a specific value of blood pressure.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the chemical entities in the given paragraph are \"2.5 mg\" and \"5 mg\"."},
