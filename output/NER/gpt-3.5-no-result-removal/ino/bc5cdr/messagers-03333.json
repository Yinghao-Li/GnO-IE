Oxidative stress - This is not a specific chemical entity, but rather a biological process involving the imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify them.\n\n2. Lipids - This refers to a class of organic compounds that include fats, oils, and waxes. They are not specific chemicals, but rather a broad category.\n\n3. Proteins - These are large biomolecules composed of amino acids. Again, proteins are not specific chemicals but a class of compounds.\n\n4. Renal Nrf2 - Nrf2 is a transcription factor involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress. It is not a chemical entity but a protein.\n\nTherefore, there are no specific \"Chemical\" entities mentioned in the paragraph."},
