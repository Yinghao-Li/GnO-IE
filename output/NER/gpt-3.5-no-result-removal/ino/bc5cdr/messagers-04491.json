It is not a disease.\n- CD-832: This is not a recognized disease entity. It appears to be a drug or experimental compound.\n- ISO infusion: ISO is not a recognized disease entity. It likely refers to isoproterenol, a medication used to treat bradycardia and heart block.\n- stenosis: This is a narrowing or constriction of a blood vessel or other tubular structure. While it is not a specific disease, it can be associated with various conditions such as atherosclerosis or heart valve disease.\n\nStep 2: Filter out non-disease entities.\n\n- nifedipine: Exclude.\n- CD-832: Exclude.\n- ISO infusion: Exclude.\n- stenosis: Include.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only disease entity identified in the paragraph is \"stenosis.\""},
