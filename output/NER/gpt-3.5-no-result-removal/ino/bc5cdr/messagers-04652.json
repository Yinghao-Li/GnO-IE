Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph.\n\n1. \"manic-like adverse effects\" - This phrase refers to a set of adverse effects that resemble manic symptoms. It can be considered a disease entity.\n\n2. \"psychomotor stimulants\" - This phrase refers to a class of drugs that stimulate the central nervous system. While it does not directly mention a specific disease, it is related to the medical use of these drugs, which can be associated with certain diseases or conditions.\n\n3. \"sympathomimetic agents\" - This phrase refers to a class of drugs that mimic the effects of the sympathetic nervous system. Similar to \"psychomotor stimulants,\" it does not directly mention a specific disease but is related to the medical use of these drugs, which can be associated with certain diseases or conditions.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, the identified \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n1. Manic-like adverse effects\n\nPlease note that the other mentioned terms, such as \"medication-associated changes,\" \"total power of pupillary oscillation,\" and \"persons at risk,\" are not specific disease entities."},
