Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph.\n\n1. \"neuroplasticity\" - This term refers to the ability of the brain to reorganize and form new neural connections. It is not a specific disease entity.\n\n2. \"neuroinflammatory changes\" - This term refers to inflammation in the brain, which can be associated with various neurological disorders. It can be considered as a potential disease entity.\n\n3. \"seizures\" - Seizures are a symptom of various neurological disorders, such as epilepsy. While seizures themselves are not a disease entity, they can be indicative of an underlying neurological condition.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, the identified \"Disease\" entity is \"neuroinflammatory changes\"."},
