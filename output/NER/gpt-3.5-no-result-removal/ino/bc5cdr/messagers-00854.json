Let's identify the \"Chemical\" entities in the given paragraph.\n\n1. \"Myocardial marker enzymes\" - This is a group of enzymes that are specific to the heart muscle and are used as indicators of heart damage or disease. It is a chemical entity.\n\n2. \"Serum\" - This refers to the liquid component of blood after the blood cells have been removed. It contains various chemicals such as proteins, electrolytes, hormones, and enzymes. It is a chemical entity.\n\nSo, the identified \"Chemical\" entities in the paragraph are:\n\n1.
