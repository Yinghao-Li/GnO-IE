Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate - diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry: This is not a disease entity. It refers to a technique used to visualize an enzyme.\n\n2. NOS: NOS stands for nitric oxide synthase, which is not a disease entity. It is an enzyme involved in the production of nitric oxide.\n\n3. Mice brain regions related to motor control: This does not refer to a specific disease entity. It mentions brain regions related to motor control in mice.\n\nBased on the paragraph, there are no specific disease entities mentioned."},
