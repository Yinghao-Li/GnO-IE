It is not clear if it is a specific chemical compound or a code name, so we will exclude it from the table.\n\n2. 1-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-3[2-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanolamino]-propan-2-ol: This is a chemical compound mentioned in the paragraph. We will include it in the table.\n\n3. Propranolol: This is another chemical compound mentioned in the paragraph. We will include it in the table.\n\nSo, the identified chemical entities in the paragraph are:\n\n| Chemical Entity |\n|-----------------|\n| Propranolol     |\n| 1-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-3[2-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanolamino]-propan-2-ol |"},
