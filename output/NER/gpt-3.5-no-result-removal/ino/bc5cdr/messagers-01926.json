    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph:\n\n1. Coronary CTA strategy - This refers to a diagnostic strategy involving coronary computed tomography angiography, which is used to assess the coronary arteries for any blockages or abnormalities.\n\n2. Cocaine-associated chest pain - This refers to chest pain that is associated with cocaine use. It is a symptom that can indicate potential cardiovascular issues.\n\n3. Coronary vasospasm - This refers to the sudden constriction or narrowing of the coronary arteries, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle and cause ischemia.\n\n4. Ischemia - This refers to a condition where there is an inadequate blood supply to a part of the body, in this case, the heart muscle. It can lead to chest pain and other symptoms.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are: coronary CTA strategy, cocaine-associated chest pain, coronary vasospasm, and ischemia."},
