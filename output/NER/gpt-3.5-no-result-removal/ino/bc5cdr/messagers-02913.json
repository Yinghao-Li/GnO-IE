Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - This is a technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. While it is not a chemical entity itself, it involves the use of certain chemicals, such as contrast agents, in some cases.\n\n2. C2 to C6 - These are not chemical entities. They refer to specific vertebrae in the spine.\n\n3. Subacute combined degeneration - This is a medical condition characterized by degeneration of the spinal cord. It is not a chemical entity.\n\nTherefore, there are no chemical entities mentioned in the given paragraph."},
