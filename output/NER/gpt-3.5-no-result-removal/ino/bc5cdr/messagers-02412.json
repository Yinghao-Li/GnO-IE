It refers to an extract derived from the plant species S. virgaurea.\n\n2. MDA: This is a chemical entity. It stands for Malondialdehyde, which is a marker of oxidative stress.\n\n3. Isoproterenol: This is a chemical entity. It is a synthetic compound that is commonly used to induce cardiac stress in animal models.\n\nPlease note that the term \"antioxidant status\" is not a specific chemical entity, but rather a general concept related to the balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant defense systems."},
