Lidocaine toxicity: Lidocaine toxicity refers to the adverse effects or toxicity caused by the administration or use of lidocaine, a local anesthetic.\n\n2. Cocaine-associated MI: MI stands for myocardial infarction, which is commonly known as a heart attack. In this case, it is specifically mentioned as \"cocaine-associated MI,\" indicating a heart attack that is associated with cocaine use.\n\n3. Cardiovascular toxicity: Cardiovascular toxicity refers to the harmful effects on the cardiovascular system, including the heart and blood vessels.\n\n4. Central nervous system toxicity: Central nervous system toxicity refers to the adverse effects or toxicity on the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, the identified \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n1. Lidocaine toxicity\n2. Cocaine-associated MI\n3. Cardiovascular toxicity\n4. Central nervous system toxicity"},
