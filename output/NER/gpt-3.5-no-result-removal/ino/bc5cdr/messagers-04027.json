Light microscopic evidence of renal damage: This phrase does not explicitly mention a specific disease. It describes a condition or state of the kidneys.\n\n2. Albuminuria: This term refers to the presence of albumin in the urine, which can be an indicator of kidney damage or disease.\n\n3. Very low serum albumin levels: This phrase indicates a low level of albumin in the blood, which can be associated with various diseases or conditions, such as kidney disease.\n\nBased on the given paragraph, the identified \"Disease\" entities are:\n\n1. Albuminuria\n2. Kidney disease (implied by the presence of renal damage and low serum albumin levels)\n\nPlease note that the paragraph does not explicitly mention a specific disease, but rather describes symptoms and indicators that can be associated with various kidney diseases."},
