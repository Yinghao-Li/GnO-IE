It also refers to a measurement of blood pressure.\n\n3. \"patients\" - This is not a chemical entity. It refers to individuals receiving treatment.\n\n4. \"nifedipine therapy\" - This is a chemical entity. Nifedipine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure.\n\n5. \"blood pressure\" - This is not a chemical entity. It refers to the force of blood against the walls of the arteries.\n\n6. \"normal range\" - This is not a chemical entity.
