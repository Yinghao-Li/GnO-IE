We can consider it as a potential disease entity.\n4. Strand breaks (SBs): This is not a disease entity but a type of DNA damage.\n5. Oxidized pyrimidines: This is not a disease entity but a type of DNA damage.\n6. TAP: TAP is not a disease entity but a protein involved in antigen presentation.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are: cardiac disarrangement, necrosis, and potentially DNA damage."},
