BCNU (Carmustine) - This is a chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph.\n2. Normal saline - This is not a chemical entity. It is a solution of sodium chloride in water and does not refer to a specific chemical compound.\n3. i.v. - This is not a chemical entity. It stands for \"intravenous,\" which refers to the method of administration.\n4. i.c.v. - This is not a chemical entity. It stands for \"intracerebroventricular,\" which refers to the method of administration.\n\nSo, the only chemical entity mentioned in the paragraph is BCNU (Carmustine)."},
