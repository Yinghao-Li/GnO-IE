Let's identify the \"Disease\" entities in the given paragraph.\n\nIn the paragraph, there are mentions of embryolethality, teratogenicity, ventricular septal defects, and wavy ribs. However, it's important to note that not all of these are diseases. Embryolethality and teratogenicity are not specific diseases but rather describe adverse effects on embryos and development. Ventricular septal defects, on the other hand, is a specific congenital heart defect that can be considered a disease. Wavy ribs, however, is not a disease but rather a description of a physical abnormality.\n\nSo, the only disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"ventricular septal defects\"."},
