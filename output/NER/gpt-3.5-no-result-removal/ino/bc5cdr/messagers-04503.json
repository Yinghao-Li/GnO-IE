PAN nephropathy: This is a medical condition and not a chemical entity.\n\n2. rhIGF-I: This is a chemical entity. It stands for recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I.\n\n3. IGF-I: This is a chemical entity. It stands for insulin-like growth factor-I.\n\n4. GH receptor: This is a chemical entity. It stands for growth hormone receptor.\n\n5. IGF-I receptor: This is a chemical entity. It stands for insulin-like growth factor-I receptor.\n\nPlease note that the term \"mRNA\" is not a chemical entity, but a type of molecule involved in gene expression."},
