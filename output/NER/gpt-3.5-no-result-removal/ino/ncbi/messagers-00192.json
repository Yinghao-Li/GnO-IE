ATM heterozygotes - This refers to individuals who have one copy of the ATM gene mutation and are at risk of developing certain diseases.\n2. Breast cancer - This is a specific disease mentioned in the paragraph.\n3. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) - This is a genetic disorder mentioned in the paragraph.\n4. Other diseases - This refers to diseases other than breast cancer that ATM heterozygotes may be susceptible to.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are: breast cancer and ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T)."},
