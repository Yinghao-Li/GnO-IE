Sensorineural deafness: This is a disease characterized by hearing loss due to damage to the inner ear or the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain.\n\n2. Piebaldism: This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by patches of white skin and hair due to the absence of melanocytes in certain areas.\n\n3. Waardenburg syndrome: This is a group of genetic conditions that can cause hearing loss, changes in pigmentation (such as white patches of hair or skin), and other developmental abnormalities.\n\nSo, the \"Disease\" entities in the paragraph are \"sensorineural deafness,\" \"piebaldism,\" and \"Waardenburg syndrome.\""},
