It is a peptide hormone involved in regulating food intake.\n\n2. MC4-R: This is not a disease entity. It is a receptor involved in the regulation of food intake.\n\n3. human obesity: This is a disease entity. It refers to the condition of being excessively overweight or obese.\n\n4. POMC: This is not a disease entity. It is a gene that encodes for the pro-opiomelanocortin protein, which is involved in the production of various hormones, including alpha-MSH.\n\nBased on the paragraph, the only disease entity mentioned is \"human obesity\"."},
