It refers to a specific gene associated with retinoblastoma, a type of eye cancer.\n\n2. \"retinal tumours\" - This is a disease entity. It refers to tumors that occur in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.\n\n3. \"pineal tumours\" - This is also a disease entity. It refers to tumors that occur in the pineal gland, a small endocrine gland in the brain.\n\nSo, the disease entities in the paragraph are \"retinal tumours\" and \"pineal tumours\"."},
