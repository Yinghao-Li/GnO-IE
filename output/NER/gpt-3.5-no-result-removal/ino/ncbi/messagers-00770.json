    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the given paragraph, the identified \"Disease\" entities are as follows:\n\n1. homozygous deficiency: This refers to a condition where an individual has two copies of a gene with a specific mutation, leading to a deficiency in a particular factor or protein.\n\n2. Factor H deficiency: This refers to a deficiency in the 150-kD form of Factor H, which is a protein involved in the regulation of the immune system.\n\n3. Factor H-related protein (FHR) bands: This refers to bands of proteins related to Factor H that are present upon immunoblotting. The presence of these bands may indicate a disease or abnormality in the regulation of the immune system.\n\nPlease note that the paragraph does not explicitly mention any specific disease names. It describes the deficiency and presence of certain proteins, which may be associated with certain diseases or conditions."},
