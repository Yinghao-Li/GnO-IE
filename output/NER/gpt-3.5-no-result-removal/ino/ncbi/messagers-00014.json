It stands for \"dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase,\" which is a gene associated with myotonic dystrophy, a genetic disorder.\n\n2. Myotonic dystrophy: Myotonic dystrophy is a disease entity mentioned indirectly in the paragraph. It is a genetic disorder associated with the DMPK gene.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"myotonic dystrophy.\""},
