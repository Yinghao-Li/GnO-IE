Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS): This is a genetic disorder that affects appetite, growth, metabolism, and cognitive function.\n\n2. Maternal disomy 15: This refers to the presence of two copies of chromosome 15 inherited from the mother, instead of one copy from each parent.\n\n3. Paternal t(3;15) (p25;q11.2): This refers to a translocation between chromosomes 3 and 15 in the father's genetic material.\n\n4. Meiotic nondisjunction: This refers to the failure of chromosomes to separate properly during meiosis, resulting in an abnormal number of chromosomes in the resulting cells.\n\nBased on the paragraph, the identified \"Disease\" entities are Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and maternal disomy 15."},
