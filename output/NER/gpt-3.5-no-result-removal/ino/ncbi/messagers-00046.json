It refers to a measurement of the ability of blood serum to cause the lysis (destruction) of red blood cells.\n\n2. homozygous C5-deficient (C5D) sera - This refers to a condition where the individual is deficient in the C5 protein, which is involved in the complement system. It can be considered a disease entity.\n\nTherefore, the disease entity mentioned in the paragraph is \"homozygous C5-deficient (C5D) sera\"."},
