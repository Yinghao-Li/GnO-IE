The target poly(2,7 - carbazole - alt - diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDSeBT ) was obtained by Suzuki polymerization of M1 and M2 in degassed toluene / water with K 3 PO 4 as an organic base , Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 as a catalyst , and P(o - tol ) 3 as the corresponding ligand at 90 ° C for 3 days . The crude polymer was purified by reprecipitation and Soxhlet extraction with methanol , acetone , hexane , and chlorobenzene . Details of synthesis of monomers , polymerization , and their characterizations are given in the Experimental Section . After purification , gel - permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis against PS standard exhibits a number - averaged molecular mass ( M n ) of 83 ^ 000 g / mol with a polydispersity ( PDI ) of 2.51 . The polymer is readily soluble in common solvents such as chloroform , toluene , THF , and chlorobenzene . As shown in Figure 1a , the UV - vis absorption spectra of PCDSeBT both in chloroform solution and solid state exhibit two distinct absorption bands , as typically observed for donor ( D)-acceptor ( A ) low bandgap materials . The absorption maxima ( λ max ) of the film are located at 403 and 589 nm . The shorter absorption band is due to π - π * transitions of the polymer backbone , 13 while the lower - energy peak is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) in the electron - rich and electron - deficient units . 14 It is worth noting that the maxima absorption values of PCDSeBT in the film are slightly broadened without any obvious red - shift when compared to the solution . This verifies that only a small reorganization via π - π stacking between the polymer chains is within view during the film formation because of the interchain aggregates in solution . 15 This observation is in contrast to many conjugated polymers , in which there is a red - shift that occurs in going from the solution to the solid state due to the aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state , 3,16 even the PCDTBT film is red - shifted by 30 nm vs solution . 5a Besides , the deep blue color of PCDSeBT solution is observed unlike the red color of PCDTBT in solution ( see the digital photograph in Figure 1a ) . Notably , although the absorption profile of PCDSeBT is similar to that of the thiophene analogue , PCDTBT , the absorption onset of PCDSeBT is significantly red - shifted by ∼ 70 nm , corresponding to a lower optical bandgap ( E g opt = 1.70 eV ) than PCDTBT ( E g opt = 1.85 eV ) .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
