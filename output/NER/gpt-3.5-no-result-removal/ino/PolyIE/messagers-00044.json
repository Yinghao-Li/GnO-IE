In the ( 010 ) in - plane pattern related to π - π stacking , as shown Figure 1b , a broad diffraction peak was detected at approximately 24.0 ° . Using the same calculation , the π - π stacking distance ( d π ) was 3.7 Å. The results are similar to thiophene and thiophene - fused aromatic system polymers that perform well as OPVs . 19,25 In the out - of - plane of PCZDTB , as shown in Figure 1a , no diffraction peak was observed in the thin film . As reported before , a broad diffraction peak was observed at approximately 20.5 ° in the diffraction of powdery PCZDTB ( see Supporting Information ) . 26 The π - π stacking distance ( d π ) was 4.3 Å. The result was similar to the result for π - π stacking ( d π = 4.0 - 4.4 Å ) of fluorene - thiophene . The benzene - thiophene linkage has a twisted structure compared with the thiophenethiophene linkage . The structure has an impact on π - π stacking ( d π ) as well . 27 By calculating PCZDTB and PQCDTB using a density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation , the tilt angle has been comparatively analyzed . In terms of tilt angle , PCZDTB was 27 - 28 ° , while PQCDTB was 19 - 21 ° . Compared with PCZDTB , formation of a planar backbone and stronger π - π stacking were observed in PQCDTB ( see Supporting Information ) . On the basis of this result , it has been confirmed that π - π stacking was more effective in PQCDTB than in PCZDTB because of coplanarity of the quinacridone unit that was introduced to the main chain of PQCDTB . 13 Figure 2 showed the UV - visible spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB . As shown in Figure 2 , the maximum absorption peak of PQCDTB ( λ max ) was observed at 389 and 539 nm , respectively , in solution ( 10 ^ -6 M in chloroform ) . On the other hand , the maximum absorption peaks of PCZDTB ( λ max ) were observed at 386 and 514 nm in solution . The band around 380 nm in the absorption spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB can be assigned to π - π * transition whereas the 530 - 550 band are due to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between donor and acceptor moieties . 10 The absorption spectrum of PQCDTB is broadened and red - shifted compared to that of PCZDTB . This can be explained by the much stronger ICT effects in the PQCDTB than that in PCZDTB .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
