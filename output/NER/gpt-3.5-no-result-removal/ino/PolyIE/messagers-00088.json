The resulting photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables S1 , S2 , and S3 , respectively . The optimized ratio of 1 : 1.3 , thickness of 80 nm , and annealing temperature of 120 ° C were obtained . In these optimized conditions , two typical devices using PC71BM and PC61BM as acceptor exhibited the following typical J - V characteristics in Figure 2 under 1000 W m -2 air mass 1.5 global ( AM 1.5 G ) illumination . Device parameters , such as J SC , V OC , FF , and PCE are deduced from the J - V characteristics and summarized in Table 3 . It is clear that the PBDT - TDPP - S : PC71BM - based devices exhibited better photovoltaic properties as compared to the PBDT - TDPP - S : PC61BM - based devices , which can be attributed to the stronger absorption of PC71BM than PC61BM in the visible region from 440 to 530 nm , as shown in Figure 1b . A maximal PCE of 4.89 % with an V OC of 0.84 V , a J SC of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 56.0 % was achieved for the PBDT - TDPP - S : PC71BM - based devices . To our best knowledge , the recorded maximum PCE and FF levels here are higher than those for the previous side - chain D - A conjugated copolymersbased PSCs . Furthermore , these PSCs based on the side - chain D - A polymer of PBDT - TDPP - S presented significantly improved device performance over those PSCs using a mainchain D - A polymer of PDPP - BDT or PBDTPP - OR as donor . 7 Figure 3 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) curve of the device with the PBDT - TDPP - S : PC71BM blend . The EQE values are about 45 % with a broad response from 300 to 750 nm , which are consistent with the optical absorption profile in Figure 1b . According to the EQE curve and the solar irradiation spectrum , the integral current density value of the device is 9.70 mA cm^-2 . The difference between the measured J SC and the integral current density values is within 3 % . It indicates that our photovoltaic measurement is accurate and reliable . The moderate EQE reported here implies some potential for further enhancement in J SC as well . To assess the charge transport properties for the PBDT - TDPP - S : PC71BM blend used as photoactive layer , we measured the J - V characteristics of single charge carrier devices at room temperature and applied space - charge - limited - current ( SCLC ) model to extract the charge carrier mobility .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
