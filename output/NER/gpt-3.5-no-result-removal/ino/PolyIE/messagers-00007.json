The decrease in both the J sc and FF could be due to inferior polymer chain packing in the active layer leading to a poor charge transporting network . Besides , the device performance generally varied with the length of alkyl side chains attached onto the polymer backbone . The device efficiency initially increases upon the incorporation of longer alkyl side chains from decyl to tetradecyl reaching a maximum at tetradecyl - substituted PffBB-14 and then declines with further alkyl side chain extension . Importantly , such chain Article length - dependent device performance trend is spin - coating temperature independent . The champion PffBB-14 - based device affords the highest PCE of 9.93 % with a V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36 % . The size of the alkyl side chain is known to affect the processability and interchain interactions of a polymer , which would provide a tool to optimize the π - π stacking interactions of a polymer in the solid state .

Figure 5a shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of PffBB - n / PC71BM - based PSCs . Strong and broad photo - to - current responses were observed in the range from 330 to 780 nm in all of these PSCs , in which the absorption above 650 nm was attributed to the polymer aggregationinduced absorption broadening . Remarkably , the PffBB-14based device exhibited a much higher photoconversion Article response ranging from 350 to 500 nm than those of other devices , thus affording the highest J sc among all of these devices . As PffBB - n polymers showed similar absorption properties , the high current density of PffBB-14 - based PSC would result from well - ordered polymer : PC71BMnetwork / packing .
