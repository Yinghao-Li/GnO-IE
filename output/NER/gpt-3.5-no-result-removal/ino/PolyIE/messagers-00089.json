Although PBDT - TDPP - S contains bulky and rigid side chains , its blend film with PC71BM exhibited a high hole mobility of 3.8 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Moreover , the observed hole mobility is higher than those of the recent reported mainchain D - A polymers , 9 verifying that side - chain D - A polymers can have strong intermolecular orbital overlap and good molecular packing like main - chain D - A polymers . Besides the high hole mobility , the blend also presented high electron mobility in range of 4.4 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( see Figure S7 ) . The measured hole and electron mobility are listed in Table 4 . Such high and balanced hole - electron mobility for the PBDT - TDPP - S is responsible for the high FF level in the devices . To our best knowledge , the FF is the highest reported to date for side - chain D - A conjugated copolymers The surface morphology of the active layers was studied using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) under tapping mode in order to further understand why the device exhibited better photovoltaic properties at the annealing temperature of 120 ° C. Figure S8 shows typical AFM topography of the PBDT - TDPP - S : PC71BM blend film in unannealed and annealed conditions ( see Supporting Information ) . The surface roughness is observed to be 0.773 nm in unannealed condition and 0.602 nm in annealed condition . It indicates that the surface roughness of the blend film can be tuned much smoother by the prethermal annealing . The smooth morphology of the active layer is available for improving the device performance . 10 Therefore , the devices exhibited improved photovoltaic properties by prethermal annealing at an appropriate temperature . In summary , a novel conjugated polymer of PBDT - TDPP - S was successfully obtained , which contains a donor unit of benzo [ 1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene in main chain and an acceptor unit of diketopyrrolopyrrole in side chain . The resultant sidechain D - A polymer exhibited high carrier mobility and outstanding photovoltaic properties in polymer solar cells with a PCE as high as 4.89 % . The PCE level is the highest reported to date in the side - chain D - A conjugated copolymersbased single BHJ PSCs , which is twice higher than that of the corresponding main - chain D - A polymer - based ones . Our work presented a new promising side - chain polymeric photovoltaic material for high - performance PSCs .
