The low J SC values of P5 and P6 were unexpected , considering the lower band gaps of P5 ( 1.49 eV ) and P6 ( 1.55 eV ) compared to that of P7 ( 1.85 eV ) . To better understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC values , the space - chargelimited current ( SCLC ) of hole - only devices of the P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 blended devices were measured and compared ( Figure S5 ) . The hole - only devices were constructed under optimized device conditions with the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / blends / Au . The hole mobilities of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 were 1.14 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.13 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.09 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.10 × 10 ^ -4 , and 1.18 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively , showing that the hole mobilities of all random terpolymers were similar to or 1 order of magnitude higher than their parent polymers .
