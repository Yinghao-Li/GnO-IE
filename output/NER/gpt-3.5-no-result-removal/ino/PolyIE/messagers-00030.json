The synthesized polymers were soluble in common organic solvents , and formed smooth and uniform spin - coated thin films . All of the polymers studied were found to exhibit good thermal stability , losing less than 5 % of their weight upon heating to approximately 350 ° C.

Extensive research has been carried out during the past decade on bulk heterojunction solar cells that utilize organic semiconducting materials . 1 The main advantages of organic photovoltaic devices ( OPVs ) are their lightweight , flexible nature , and their cost - effective manufacture by various printing technologies . The photoconversion process in OPVs is accomplished by efficient light absorption by conjugated polymers and accepting materials , charge separation at the interface of the donor polymer and the accepting materials , and subsequent charge collection at the electrodes . Matching the absorption of the conjugated polymer to the solar spectrum determines the ultimate performance of the solar cell .
