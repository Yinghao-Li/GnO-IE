Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 14,[32][33][34][35][36] In 2008 , we reported the synthesis of a copolymer between the DTP donor and the DTBT acceptor . 27 It has been proved that the thienyl ring can enhance the π - π stacking intermolecular interactions and lead to a high charge carrier mobility . 37 In addition , the ordered structure can enhance the carrier mobility ; thereby symmetric thienyl units along the polymer main chain are selected . In this regard , a simple and effective method might be to tune the properties of D - A type photovoltaic polymers by introducing thienyl groups as spacers between donor and acceptor segments in the backbone . In this study , three kinds of low band gap copolymers integrating DTP as the donor block and the most - used BT as the acceptor unit were synthesized . Different numbers of thienyl (T) as spacers were introduced along the copolymer main chain to investigate the effect on optical , electrochemical and photovoltaic performance . [6,6]-Phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 70 BM) was used as an acceptor in the blended film of copolymers : PC 70 BM . Different solvents (chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2 - dichlorobenzene (DCB) ) were tested to build an optimized interpenetrated network in the active film , and the corresponding film properties and the photovoltaic device performance are discussed in detail . Fig . 1 shows the optical absorption spectra of PDTP - BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT in CHCl 3 solution and in thin films spin - coated on quartz plates . The absorption maximum wavelength in the solutions and the films and the optical band gap deduced from the absorption onsets are summarized in Table 1 . Judging from the splitting of the absorption bands , it can be speculated that the polymers have the typical absorption characteristics of D - A type copolymers with π - π * and charge transfer - type transitions . Comparing the polymers PDTP - BT and PDTP - DT2BT with the previously synthesized polymer PDTP - DTBT , 27 the difference in their absorption is distinct . The PDTP - DTBT solution showed two prominent absorption maxima at 450 and 671 nm , while PDTP - BT and PDTP - DT2BT solutions demonstrated two main absorption maxima at 413 and 711 nm and at 480 and 603 nm , respectively . Although the absorption peaks in the Scheme 1 Synthetic route of three dithienopyrrole - based donor - acceptor type copolymers with thienyl spacers . long wavelength blue - shifted by 40 nm and 108 nm with insertion of one and two thienyl spacers to PDTP - BT , the absorption coefficients at the absorption maxima increase from 3.6 × 10 ^ 4 (PDTP - BT) to 4.0 × 10 ^ 4 (PDTP - DTBT) and 4.7 × 10 ^ 4 L mol^-1 cm^-1 (PDTP - DT2BT) , respectively . In thin films , the three copolymers exhibit similar shapes and red - shifted absorption spectra compared with those in the solutions , which indicates stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid state .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
