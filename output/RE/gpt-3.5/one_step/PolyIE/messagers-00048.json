Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Using P1 as electron donor and solution - processable fullerene derivative PC61BM as electron acceptor , we fabricated bulk heterojunction OPV devices with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / P1 : PC61BM (1 : 1 , w / w) / Al . Without any device optimization , the device afforded an open circuit voltage (V oc) of 0.50 V , a short - circuit current density (J sc) of 1.42 mA / cm^2 , a fill factor (FF) of 42.4 % , and a preliminary power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.30 % under an AM 1.5 simulated solar light at 100 mW / cm^2 (Figure 7) . The PCE is lower than that of poly[thiopheneimide - alt - benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b 0] dithiophene] , 20 - 22 probably due to low hole mobility of P1 (ca . 10 ^ -6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1) . (LUMO ≈ -3.8 eV) , 4 dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 - h] We have designed and synthesized a new fused - ring building block , dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide . On the basis of this new building block , we have designed and synthesized a series of new conjugated copolymers containing electron - rich unit benzodithiophene or electron - deficient unit bithiazole or benzothiadiazole and homopolymers . The optical properties and HOMO / LUMO levels can be manipulated through adjusting copolymerized building blocks . Compared to homopolymer P6 , all copolymers P1 - P5 exhibit red - shifted absorption and emission spectra in solution and in film and smaller bandgaps . Dithieno-[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide and its homopolymer exhibit low HOMO of -6.2 eV and relatively low LUMO of -3.1 eV , indicating that it is relatively weak n - type building block . Increase in electron - donating strength of the counit leads to upshift in both HOMO and LUMO , while increase in electron - withdrawing strength of the counit leads to downshift in both HOMO and LUMO . Preliminary OPV results show that polymer solar cells based on P1 : PC61BM (1 : 1 , w / w) gave a PCE of 0.30 % under an AM 1.5 simulated solar light at 100 mW / cm^2 . ' THF and toluene were distilled from sodium benzophenone under nitrogen prior to use . 3,4 - Dibromofuran-2,5 - dione (1) was synthesized according to the literature method . 41 4,8 - Didodecyloxybenzodithiophene-2,6ditin and 4,4 0 -dihexyl-2,2 0 -bithiazole-5,5 0 -ditin were synthesized according to our published procedures . 47 Characterization . The 1 H and 13 ° C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer . Mass spectra were measured on a GCT - MS micromass spectrometer using EI mode or on a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MALDI - TOF Analyzer using MALDI mode . Elemental analyses were carried out using a FLASH EA1112 elemental analyzer . Solution (chloroform) and thin - film (on quartz substrate) UV - vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer . Solution (CHCl 3) and thin - film (on quartz substrate) emission spectra were collected on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorophotometer .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
