Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 14 In particular , Guo et al . reported that OFETs based on a phthalimide - containing polythiophene exhibited hole mobilities of ∼ 0.2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 under ambient conditions without optimization . 14 Thiophene imide has simple , compact , symmetric , and planar structure . It could promote intrachain and interchain interactions along and between coplanar polymer chains . Zhang et al . pioneered to use thiophene imide as a building block in conjugated polymers . 15,16 Later , thiophene imide homopolymers were synthesized . 17 - 19 Recently , polymer solar cells based on blends of copolymers of thiophene imide and benzodithiophene 20 - 23 or cyclopentadithiophene 24 with soluble fullerene derivatives PC71BM or PC61BM exhibited PCEs of 3 - 6.8 % . Wudl et al . reported low - bandgap conjugated polymers based on thiophene - fused phthalimide , i.e. , isothianaphthene imides (5 , Figure 1) . 25,26 2,2 0 -Bithiophene-3,3 0 -dicarboximide (BTI , 6 , Figure 1) with π - core planarity , antiparallel BTI packing , a short cofacial π - π distance of 3.43 Å , and a favorable solubilizing group orientation is a promising building block in n - type polymers . 27 Facchetti et al . reported that n - channel OFET based on a bithiophene imide homopolymer exhibited a μ e of 1.1 x 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , I on / I off of 2 x 10 ^ 7 , and a high V th (75 V) in vacuum after annealing process at 240 ° C. 27 The fused - ring system can maximize the π - orbital overlap by restricting intramolecular rotation in the oligomer and possibly to induce face - to - face π - stacking , facilitating charge transport through intermolecular hopping . On the other hand , the fused rings can make the polymer backbone more rigid and coplanar , therefore enhancing effective π - conjugation , lowering bandgap , and extending absorption . 28 - 31 Therefore , fused - ring building blocks are widely used in synthesis of conjugated polymers . 32 - 34 For example , the large planar benzodithiophene (BDT) unit has emerged as an attractive building block for conjugated polymers . 35 Benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0] dithiophene (7 , Figure 2) with a curved structure prevents a fully conjugated pathway between substituents at the 2 - and 6 - positions . Hence , delocalization of the conjugated π - electron system along the copolymer backbone is disfavored by the incorporation of this unit . This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation . Additionally , compared to a single thiophene ring , it must be pointed out that due to the large resonance stabilization energy of BDT , the delocalization of electrons from the BDT unit into the backbone is less favorable than from the thiophene ring . As a result , a more stable copolymer with high performance can be obtained by using BDT as the core unit . OFETs based on a benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0] dithiophene copolymer manufactured on flexible substrate exhibited high hole mobility of 0.5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 when the source - gate voltage is increased to 60 V.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
