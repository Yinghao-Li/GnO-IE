Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: It can be noticed that the HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO is 0.15 eV lower than that of PzNDTDTBT , which benefits from the replacement of BT unit by the stronger electron - accepting BO unit due to the stronger electronegativity of oxygen atom than that of sulfur atom . Since the open - circuit voltage V oc of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs is positively correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , a higher V oc for PzNDTDTBObased polymer solar cells could be anticipated due to the lowerlying HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO . 24 Photovoltaic Properties . To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the NDT - based semiconductor , PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated . Figure 5 shows the current density - voltage characteristic of PSCs based on the blends of polymer : PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5 G , 100 mW cm^-2 . To further study the performance of the PSC devices , the hole mobilities in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method using devices with structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au at the optimized blend ratio of polymer / PC71BM . For unipolar transport in a trap - free semiconductor with an ohmic injecting contact , the SCLC can be approximated by the Mott - Gurney equation : ε ε μ γ ≅ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ J V L V L 9 ^ 8 exp 0.891 r 0 ^ 0 2 ^ 3 (3) Here J is the current density , ε r is the dielectric constant of the polymer , ε 0 is the free - space permittivity (8.85 × 10 ^ -12 F / m) , μ 0 is the charge mobility at zero field , γ is a constant , L is the thickness of the blended film layer , V = V appl - V bi , V appl is the applied potential , and V bi is the built - in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode (in this device structure , V bi = 0.2 V) . Figure 6 displays the ln(JL 3 / V 2) vs (V / L) 0.5 curve for the measurement of the hole mobility of the blend films of PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM (1 : 2 , w / w) and PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM (1.5 : 1 , w / w) by the SCLC method . According to eq 3 , the hole mobilities obtained are as high as 3.3 × 10 ^ -3 and 4.4 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO , respectively . Obviously , from the viewpoint of hole mobility , PzNDTDTBO is more suitable (higher than 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1) for the application as photovoltaic donor materials in PSCs .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
