In conclusion , a highly effective photovoltaic polymer with NIR response , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) , based on alternating 3,6 - dithien-2 - yl-2 , 5 - dibutylpyrrolo[3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione units has been synthesized . PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) has high hole mobility (0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1) and broad photocurrent response wavelengths from 300 nm to 1.1 μm . The photovoltaic properties of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) were preliminarily investigated , and high shortcircuit current (14.87 mA / cm^2) and PCE (2.71 %) were achieved . Considering the sufficiently high I SC values of this system , more promising photovoltaic performance is thought to be achievable by using other fullerene derivatives with high LUMO energy levels , such as bis - PCBM 13 or Lu3N @ C80 - PCBH . 14 Further device optimization and the synthesis of new μmRpolymers are currently in progress and will be reported in due course .
