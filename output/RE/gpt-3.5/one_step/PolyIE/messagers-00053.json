Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: In the case for (BDTT - DPP) 3 and (BDTT - TPD) 3 , the electron density in the HOMO wave function is evenly delocalized , but the electron density in the LUMO wave function of (BDTT - DPP) 3 is slightly more localized on the electron - withdrawing units (DPP) compared to (BDTT - TPD) 3 (Figure S7) . In contrast , for (BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD) , the electron density distribution in the HOMO wave function is different from those of (BDTT - DPP) 3 5c , d) . Therefore , the small portions of DPP could hinder the preseparation of an exciton into a loosely Coulombically bound exciton , which suppresses electron transfer from donor (polymer) to acceptor (PCBM) . 48 - 50 Therefore , one possible explanation of the lower PCEs in P5 and P6 is that the DPP acts as a trapping site , resulting in poor intramolecular charge transfer . In contrast , as evidenced in the results of the DFT calculations for (BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP) , the electron distribution in the HOMO and LUMO wave functions is similar to those of (BDTT - DPP) 3 and (BDTT - TPD) 3 (Figures 5a , b) . Such a trapping effect is expected to be trivial in P2 and P3 random terpolymers with a higher DPP to TPD ratio . Therefore , the incorporation of different electron - deficient units could significantly influence the intramolecular charge transfer , suggesting that the optimum composition is required to tune the intra - and intermolecular charge transfer and their performance of PSCs . More detailed studies are currently underway . Finally , to further improve the PCE of P3 : PC71BM , methanol was spin - coated on the top of the active layer before electrode deposition . The effect of a polar solvent in such a case has been reported . 51 - 53 The P3 : PC71BM device exhibited a V OC of 0.76 V , a J SC of 16.32 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.51 with a high PCE value of 6.33 % . Structural Properties and Morphological Behavior . The compositional effect of the two electron - deficient groups on the polymer packing and nanostructured order in thin films was investigated by grazing incidence X - ray scattering (GIXS) measurement . A thin layer (40 - 50 nm) of PEDOT : PSS was spin - coated onto silicon substrates , and the pristine polymer or the blended thin films were produced by spin - coating on top of the PEDOT : PSS layer . Figure S8 shows the GIXS patterns of the pristine P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 , while Figure 6 presents the GIXS patterns of the P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 blended films with either PC71BM or PC61BM under optimized device conditions . In the in - plane X - ray profiles , a distinct peak of reflections from the (100) crystal plane , corresponding to the lamellar spacing , exists in all pristine polymer films .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
