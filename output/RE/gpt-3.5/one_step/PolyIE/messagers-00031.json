Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: It is also noteworthy that , the short circuit current of the devices increased with an increase in the number of perylene units in the polymer , except for the case of PFDTBT_20Per . Even though PFDTBT_20Per showed the highest hole mobility among the PFDTBT - based copolymers , it is UV - visible absorption spectrum showed greater blue - shifting than PFDTBT , as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , and it showed the widest band gap energy among all of the polymers considered herein . This may be why the short circuit current of the device fabricated using PFDTBT_20Per is lower than that of PFDTBT , despite it higher mobility . The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the best photovoltaic performance among the PFDTBT - based polymers (V oc = 0.74 V , J sc = 7.19 mA / cm^2 , PCE = 2.16 %) . For the photovoltaic devices fabricated using PFD2TBT - based polymers , the shortcircuit currents of the devices also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased ; however , the PCEs of the devices using PFD2TBT - based polymers were lower than those of PFDTBT - based polymers because of lower open - circuit voltages and short - circuit currents . The device fabricated using PFD2TBT_10Per showed the highest PCE (1.51 %) among the PFD2TBT - based polymers . The characteristics of the ITO / 4 . Figure 8 shows that the J - V characteristics of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices provide a similar trend to those of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices but their PCEs increased mainly due to increased short circuit currents . The increase in the short circuit current originates from the introduction of the thin titanium suboxide (TiO x) layer (ca . âˆ¼ 10 nm) . The titanium suboxide layer could block holes to the aluminum electrode , thus it could increase the short circuit current of the photovoltaic device . The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the highest PCE of 3.16 % with an open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , a short circuit current of 9.61 mA / cm^2 and the highest fill factor (0.41) among the fabricated devices . The characteristics of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices are summarized in Table 5 . Figure 9 shows the incident photon - to - current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PFDTBT-10Per + PC71BM / LiF and TiO x / Al devices . The absorption onset corresponding to the photon - to - current conversion efficiency was about 750 nm for these devices , and the absorption onset values corresponding to the maximum conversion efficiency values were 427 and 560 nm . The morphologies of the polymers and PC71BM blend films were observed by tapping - mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
