Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: For the film , the maxima absorption spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were red - shifted by 9 - 23 nm compared with the solution . These results are explained by their much more planar conformations in the solid state . 10 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram of PCZDTB and PQCDTB , which were measured in 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate acetonitrile . As reported by Lidzey et al . , the PCZDTB oxidation (E ox onset) and reduction (E red onset) onset potential were + 1.09 and -1.37 V , respectively , and the HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.44 and -2.98 eV. In the case of PQCDTB , unlike the PQA2 T (poly[quinacridone - bithiophene] ) reported by Takimiya et al . , a clear oxidation - reduction peak was observed . 19 This type of result has been obtained because PQCDTB was D - A structured , unlike the typical p - type structure of PQA2T. In PQCDTB , the oxidation (E ox onset) and reduction (E red onset) onset potentials were + 0.89 and -1.36 V , respectively . The HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.24 and -2.99 eV , respectively . Table 2 summarizes the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers . As shown in Table 2 , the HOMO level of PQCDTB (-5.24 eV) was higher than that of PCZDTB by 0.2 eV because the HOMO level of the QC derivative was higher than that of carbazole . The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference between the HOMO energy levels and the optical bandgap energies . According to the calculations , the LUMO levels of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were -3.32 and -3.46 eV , respectively . They slightly differed from the levels calculated through CV , but they mostly exhibited a similar tendency . Figure 4 shows the band diagram of the energy levels that have been obtained through DFT calculations and experiments . The bandgap energies of PQCDTB and PCZDTB determined through UV - vis spectra were reported as 1.98 and 1.92 eV , respectively , which were lower than the results of the DFT calculation by 0.57 and 0.55 V. 28 Because the HOMO level is lower than the P3HT HOMO level (-4.9 eV) in both polymers , a relatively high air stability could be obtained . 29 In the case of PQCDTB , the LUMO level (-3.32 eV) was higher than the PC71BM LUMO level (-4.0 eV) by 0.68 eV. However , the HOMO level (-5.24 eV) was lower than the PEDOT : PSS HOMO level (-5.0 eV) by 0.24 eV. Therefore , if charge separation occurs after receiving light energy , a hole would exhibit more effective charge transport than an electron in the active layer of PQCDTB . 14,26 Figure 5 and Table 3 show the results of evaluating the characteristics of an OPV device .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
