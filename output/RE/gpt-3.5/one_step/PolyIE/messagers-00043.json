In Figure 6a , microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM , while the polymer formed a small fibril - type domain at a 1 : 1 PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio . As shown in Figure 6c , the fibril domain or microphase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size . It appears that this type of fibril domain occurred because PQCDTB formed effective π - π stacking based on outstanding crystallinity . 31 As shown in Figure 6b , in contrast , when the PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio was 1 : 2 , the polymers were assembled , and a large domain was formed . As a result , a relatively large - size phase separation took place . As shown in Figure 6d , the large domain or the large - size phase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size . The large - phase separation exhibits a low photocurrent by reducing the charge separation and increasing the exciton diffusion length and the recombination of electric charges . 32 Therefore , at a 1 : 2 polymer / PC71BM ratio , a large phase separation occurs between the polymer and the PC71BM . As a result , a low photocurrent would occur ; this is comparable to the 1 : 1 ratio . The same results were confirmed for the current device using the data in Table 3 . Similar results were observed between PQCDTB and PC61BM as well . When the PCZDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 4 , a smooth morphology was detected , and no fibril domain was observed , just like the PQCDTB , because the self - organization of PCZDTB is lower than that of PQCDTB . 9 In this study , PQCDTB has been successfully synthesized through the Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing planar quinacridone unit and a broad - absorption benzothiadiazole unit . PQCDTB had a high molecular weight and good thermal stability . Because of the appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels , an effective balance was produced . According to the X - ray diffraction measurement , a broad diffraction peak was observed at approximately 24.0 ° . In terms of the π - π stacking distance (d π) , a significantly shorter distance (3.7 Å) was observed . These values were similar to the results of the thiophene and thiophenefused aromatic system polymers . When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the highest efficiency was detected , and V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8 % , and 2.5 % , respectively . When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the polymer formed a fibril - type domain and microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM . Because of selforganization , PQCDTB showed a higher FF compared with PCZDTB .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
