Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Figure 10 shows the AFM images of the polymer : PC71BM (1 : 5 wt %) films , which were taken after removal of the Al electrode and after device fabrication . The Al electrode was removed by dipping the devices for 1 min in a mixed acid solution containing of 16 mL of concentrated phosphoric acid , 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid , 1 mL of acetic acid , and 2 mL of D 2 O. The blend films showed almost equivalently measured smooth surfaces (according to their root - mean - square (rms) roughness) with small degrees of phase separation . The rms roughness of the active layers were 0.49 nm for PFDTBT , 0.44 nm for PFDTBT-10Per , 0.51 nm for PFD2TBT , and 0.50 nm for PFD2TBT-10Per , respectively . This result suggests that the morphologies of all the active films are very similar , so that such a property will not affect the J sc of the photovoltaic devices . Therefore , the improvement of PCE and J sc in the fabricated photovoltaic devices is derived from the enhanced π - π interaction between polymers that results from the introduction of perylene units . We introduced perylene units into PFDTBT and PFD2TBT to enhance the interchain π - π interaction . The optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized copolymers showed were slight modification upon perylene addition . Interestingly , the field - effect mobility of the TFTs , using the polymers as the active layer increased with an increasing perylene content in the copolymers . The short circuit currents of the photovoltaic devices fabricated using the polymers as an electron donor , also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased , which is consistent with the field - effect mobility results of the polymers . We conclude that the introduction of perylene to the conjugated polymer chain enhances the π - π interaction between polymer chains and improves its charge - transport ability , leading to increases short circuit currents in the photovoltaic devices .
