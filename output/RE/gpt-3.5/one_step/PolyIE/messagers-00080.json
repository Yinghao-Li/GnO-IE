This level of thermal stability is adequate for applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices . Optical Properties . The absorption spectrum of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) in film is shown in Figure 2 together with that of P3HT and normalized AM 1.5 G photon flux for comparison . The polymer has a broad absorption band in the range of 500 - 1100 nm with a tail extending to 1.3 μm . The full width at half - maximum (fwhm) of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) film is 324 nm , which is nearly a double that of P3HT film (158 nm) . The optical band gap of the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) film is 1.13 eV , as estimated from the absorption onset (1100 nm) . All these data indicate that PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) can utilize a larger fraction of solar light that P3HT as a possible material for applications in micrometer response photovoltaic devices . Electrochemical Properties . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PDTP - DTDPP-(Bu) . The CV curves were recorded referenced to an Ag / Ag þ electrode , which was calibrated against the ferroceneferrocenium (Fc / Fc þ) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) ; the CV curves are shown in Figure 3 . On the basis of the onset values of oxidation (0.10 V) and reduction potential (-1.17 V) of the polymer , the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer were calculated as -4.90 and -3.63 eV , respectively . The electrochemical band gap thus determined is about 1.27 eV , which is slightly higher than the optical band gap . X - ray Diffraction (XRD) Measurements . The XRD patterns of the bulk samples of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH) were recorded to understand their structures in the solid state . As shown in Figure 4 , both samples show diffraction peaks at low angles , which could be attributed to a lamellar structure . The d - spacings of the diffraction from (100) are 14.8 and 14.9 Å for PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH) , respectively . The peaks around 24 ° for both polymers can be assigned to the face - to - face distance of the aromatic groups in the polymer chains arranged in the parallel direction . This π - π stacking distance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) was 3.64 Å , slightly lower than that of PDTP - DTDPP(EH) (3.74 Å) , which suggests that the butyl group in DPP segment is better for the close π - π stacking of the polymer backbones compared to the bulkier 2 - ethylhexyl group . Hole Mobility . It has been strongly suggested that high hole mobility is an important requirement for effective photovoltaic polymers .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
