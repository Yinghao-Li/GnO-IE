Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Although the non - fullerene PSC exhibits a lower PCE than the PC71BM - based device , the promising photovoltaic performance over 4 % PCE with decent photovoltaic parameters (V OC , J SC and FF) suggests that PTATDPP can be used as a universal donor material compatible with various electron acceptors for high performance PSCs . We have designed and synthesized two anthracene - based low band - gap copolymers , PTATDPP and PTAFDPP . Since the TA unit has a highly conjugated 2 - D structure with a weak electron - donating nature , the copolymer composed of TA and DPP units shows a relatively low band - gap , a low - lying HOMO energy level , high crystallinity , and efficient charge transporting characteristics . The PSCs fabricated from PTATDPP and PTAFDPP with PC71BM exhibit PCEs as high as 7.02 % and 5.22 % , respectively . Furthermore , PTATDPP shows a promising PCE of 4.23 % when a non - fullerene acceptor (di - PBI) is used as an electron acceptor material for the PSC device . These results not only demonstrate that thienyl - substituted anthracene is a very promising building block as an electron - donating unit of low band - gap polymers for high performance PSCs but also PTATDPP can be used as a universal electron donor material compatible with various electron acceptor materials in PSCs .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
