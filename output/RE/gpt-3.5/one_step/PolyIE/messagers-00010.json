Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 12,13 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of this so - called donor - acceptor (D - A) type copolymers are mainly localized on the donor and acceptor units , respectively , thus the band gap can be well tuned by the choice of D and A. Such a D - A strategy is now widely used as one of the most promising approaches to design efficient polymers for application to the polymer photovoltaic . Thiophene is a simple and fundamental block to construct new D - A type copolymers . Recently , the bridged dithiophene has attracted considerable attention as a donor unit because of its ability to fix the dithiophene system into a planar structure , which is much more efficient than the dithiophene in constructing highly - conjugated copolymers . Four bridging dithiophene units with the atoms of carbon (C) , silicon (Si) , germanium (Ge) and nitrogen (N) afford cyclopenta[2,1 - b;3,4 - b′]dithiophene (CPDT) , dithienosilole (DTS) , dithienogermole (DTG) and dithieno [3,2- b : 2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) , respectively . CPDT was first introduced into the low band gap polymers , and the corresponding copolymer alternating CPDT with benzothiadiazole showed a PCE of 5.5 % , after using a small amount of alkanedithiols to control the morphology of the blend film . 14,15 Later on , large amounts of CPDT - based photovoltaic polymers were designed and synthesized . [16][17][18][19][20] In comparison with the C - C bond , a longer C - Si bond shows less steric hindrance , which directly resulted in better π - π stacking along the conjugated polymer backbones . 21,22 Polymers based on DTS normally have high hole mobility and strong light absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum and hence the improvement in photovoltaic performance , which reached 5.1 % . 12 DTG shows lower intermolecular steric hindrance than DTS because of the longer C - Ge bond compared to the C - Si , resulting in the corresponding DTG - containing solar cells exhibiting higher short - current and fill factor . [23][24][25] Planar dithieno[3,2 - b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) , with good π - conjugation , showed great potential for use in organic electronic materials . 26 D - A type photovoltaic polymers with DTP as the electron - donating unit , exhibiting low band gap and enhanced solubility , have been intensively applied to PSCs . 27,28 In our previous study , PSCs based on DTP - containing copolymers and PC 70 BM showed a short - circuit current as high as 22.6 mA cm^-1 , 29 indicating that DTP - containing copolymers could be promising building blocks for superior photovoltaic performance . On the other hand , benzothiadiazole (BT) containing the electron - withdrawing imine (-CvN-) nitrogen has been widely used as a strong acceptor in D - A copolymers . 30,31 Numerous attempts to develop novel D - A copolymers have shown that 4,7 - dithien-2 - yl-2,1,3 - benzothiadiazole (DTBT) is an effective acceptor unit , and photovoltaic devices made from blends with fullerene derivatives show PCE up to 5.4 % .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
