The weak electron - donating characteristic of TA , which has 2 - D extended conjugation by thiophene side groups , makes the copolymer exhibit a low - lying HOMO level of -5.5 eV with a low band - gap of 1.65 eV , which affords both high photo - voltage and photocurrent of the polymer solar cells . As a result , the solar cell device fabricated from the blend of the copolymer and PC71BM exhibits a promising power conversion efficiency of 7.02 % (V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 13.1 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.67) . Moreover , the polymer solar cell as fabricated from the blend of the copolymer and di - perylene bisimide (di - PBI) as a non - fullerene electron acceptor exhibits a promising power conversion efficiency of 4.23 % with V OC = 0.77 V , J SC = 9.8 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.56 . This photovoltaic performance of the copolymer not only demonstrates that the TA is a promising electron - donating building block for a high performance low band - gap copolymer , but also the copolymer is compatible with both PC71BM and a non - fullerene acceptor for high efficiency polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have important advantages over inorganic - based solar cells such as low material - cost , ease of fabrication with low processing - cost and the potential for fabrication of large area and flexible solar cells . 1 In the last decade , remarkable progress in the performance of PSCs has been achieved by introducing a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure in the active layer . [2][3][4][5] It has also been demonstrated that low band - gap conjugated polymers with broad absorption of the solar spectrum are promising active layer materials to achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) . 6,7 Hence , an effective approach to achieve a high PCE of PSC is to design and synthesize high performance conjugated polymers . [8][9][10][11] In recent efforts to develop high performance conjugated polymers , building blocks have been carefully designed for the conjugated polymers to have adequate energy levels , broad light absorption and strong self - assembly for use in BHJ PSC . [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] As one of the most promising building blocks for constructing low band - gap conjugated polymers , diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has emerged as the desirable electron - withdrawing moiety . 19,20 Over the past five years , a variety of conjugated polymers containing DPP have been investigated as promising semiconductors for application in organic optoelectronics such as field effect transistors , memory devices and PSCs . Indeed , DPP - based conjugated polymers have achieved impressive PCEs up to 9 % by the combination of DPP and various electron - donating building blocks .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
