Chris Guccione: The paragraph mentions Chris Guccione, who is from Australia. So, the nationality of Chris Guccione is Australian.\n\n2. Rochus's brother Olivier: The paragraph mentions Olivier, who is the brother of Rochus. However, the paragraph does not provide any information about Olivier's nationality.
