    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: 16 In the McCulloch group , in addition , a hole mobility of 0.24 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 and a PCE of 2.2 % were reported in a polymer containing benzo[1,2 - b:3,4 - b′:5,6 - d′]trithiophene (BTT) to produce effective intermolecular packing characteristics . 17,18 Quinacridone (QC) derivative , which is known as a red - violet pigment , has a high crystallinity and self - assembled characteristics , so it has drawn significant attention as an OTFT because of its high mobility . 19,20 However , these QC results were primarily reported for small molecules or oligomers . In the case of polymers , extremely limited results have been reported . 21,22 In the Takimiya group , recently , a polymer composed of QC derivatives has been reported for use in OTFTs that has a high hole mobility (0.2 cm^2 V -1 S^-1) . 23 In this study , we synthesized a new donor - acceptor type (D- A type) polymer , poly[quinacridone - alt - octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole] (PQCDTB) , which contained QC and octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTB) . As a result , it is most likely that a broad absorbance could be obtained as the results of the effective charge transport and the strong electron - withdrawing caused by the high coplanarity . Table 1 shows the result of the molecular weight and the thermal properties of the obtained PQCDTB . As shown in this table , when the GPC was measured using polystyrene as the standard , the number - average molecular weights (M n) of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were 49.8 and 15.2 kg / mol , respectively . In contrast , the polydispersity indices (PDIs) showed a very narrow distribution of 1.92 and 1.77 , respectively . In terms of the degree of polymerization , PQCDTB was greater than other OPV polymers by 2 - 3 times because of the introduction of long , branched side chains of quinacridone and benzothiadiazole . As a result , the backbone structure became relatively favorable in terms of the solubility at polymerization ; polymerization had effectively occurred . 6 Table 1 showed the result of the thermal analysis through TGA . As shown in Table 1 , PQCDTB and PCZDTB had a 5 % weight loss at the temperatures of 323 and 324 ° C , respectively , displaying a high thermal stability because of the rigid QC and carbazole structure , which is applicable for optoelectronic devices and OPVs , both of which require a high thermal stability (300 ° C or above) . 24 We investigated thermal behavior through DSC analysis (see Supporting Information) , which revealed no obvious thermal transitions for PQCDTB in the temperature range from 40 to 250 ° C. Thus , PQCDTB displayed amorphous property . Figure 1 showed X - ray diffraction measurements of film to analyze the ordering structure of the obtained polymers .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
