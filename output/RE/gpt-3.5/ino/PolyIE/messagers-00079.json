Up to now , the highest PCE of μmR - polymer was just 1.1 % , based on poly(di-2 - thienylthienopyrazine) by using complicated doubled active layers photovoltaic devices . 7 The fundamental requirements for promising photovoltaic μmR - polymers include the following : (a) broad absorption extending to or surpassing 1 μm to absorb more sunlight ; (b) a high LUMO energy level to allow effective photoinduced charge transfer from the polymers to the acceptor in the BHJ device and at the same time , a low HOMO level to keep the open circuit voltage (V OC) as high as possible ; (c) high carrier mobility to ensure that effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes suppresses photocurrent loss ; and (d) good solubility and appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives to form high - quality films by solution processing . The lack of successful photovoltaic μmR - polymers might be due to the difficulty of fulfilling all these requirements simultaneously with one polymer .

Photocurrent response: The photocurrent response of all the mentioned polymers extends to a wavelength of 1 μm.\n\n2. External quantum efficiency (EQE): The EQE of the mentioned polymer solar cells (PSCs) in the wavelength range between 650 and 1100 nm is typically less than 10%.\n\n3. Overall power conversion efficiencies (PCEs): The overall PCEs of the mentioned PSCs under AM1.5 simulated solar light are low due to the low EQE. The highest PCE achieved so far for the mentioned μmR-polymer is 1.1%.\n\n4. Fundamental requirements for promising photovoltaic μmR-polymers:\n   a) Broad absorption: The polymers should have broad absorption extending to or surpassing 1 μm to absorb more sunlight.\n   b) Energy levels: The polymers should have a high LUMO energy level to allow effective photoinduced charge transfer and a low HOMO level to keep the open circuit voltage (VOC) as high as possible.\n   c) Carrier mobility: The polymers should have high carrier mobility to ensure effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes and suppress photocurrent loss.\n   d) Solubility and compatibility: The polymers should have good solubility and appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives to form high-quality films by solution processing.\n\n5. Difficulty in fulfilling all requirements simultaneously: The lack of successful photovoltaic μmR-polymers might be due to the difficulty of fulfilling all the fundamental requirements simultaneously with one polymer.\n\n6.

It is designed to fulfill the fundamental requirements mentioned earlier. It has a broad photocurrent response wavelength range from 300 nm to 1.1 μm. High short-circuit current (14.87 mA/cm^2) and PCE (2.71%) were achieved, which is a significant advance for efficient μmR-polymers.\n\n9.
