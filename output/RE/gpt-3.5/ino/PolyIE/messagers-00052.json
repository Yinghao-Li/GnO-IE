    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: The PCE of P4 : PC71BM also showed a higher PCE value than P1 and P7 , with a J SC of 12.95 mA / cm^2 . In contrast , the PCE suddenly decreased in the blended device of P5 and PC61BM (3.02 %) and further decreased in P6 (2.09 %) , mainly due to the significant decrease of the J SC . The low J SC values of P5 and P6 were unexpected , considering the lower band gaps of P5 (1.49 eV) and P6 (1.55 eV) compared to that of P7 (1.85 eV) . To better understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC values , the space - chargelimited current (SCLC) of hole - only devices of the P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 blended devices were measured and compared (Figure S5) . The hole - only devices were constructed under optimized device conditions with the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / blends / Au . The hole mobilities of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 were 1.14 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.13 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.09 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.10 × 10 ^ -4 , and 1.18 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 / (V s) , respectively , showing that the hole mobilities of all random terpolymers were similar to or 1 order of magnitude higher than their parent polymers . Therefore , the trend of the J SC can not be explained solely by the changes in the optical properties and the hole mobilities . To gain a better understanding of the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC and PCE values of the PBDTT- DPP - TPD random terpolymers , the molecular geometries and the electron density distribution were simulated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP / 6 - 31G(d , p) level with the Spartan 08 software package . Three repeating units were taken as a model for calculations , and methyl was used instead of the long side chains to reduce the computational time . Four model compounds , (BDTT - DPP) 3 , (BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP) , (BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD) , and (BDTT - TPD) 3 were used and calculated for comparison . The optimized molecular geometries of the models and their calculated HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals are depicted in Figure 5 and Figure S7 . In general , for alternative copolymers , the electron density in the HOMO wave functions is well delocalized . However , the LUMO wave function shows a different degree of localization in the electron density dependent on the types of the electron - withdrawing units . 46,47 This tendency was observed in (BDTT - DPP) 3 and (BDTT - TPD) 3 .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
