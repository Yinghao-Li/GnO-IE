    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: A novel conjugated polymer of PBDT - TDPP - S was synthesized , which contains a donor unit of benzo [1,2b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene in main chain and an acceptor unit of diketopyrrolopyrrole in side chain . This kind of side - chain donor - acceptor (D - A) polymer exhibited better solution processability , lower HOMO level (-5.34 eV) , and more balanced carrier mobility relative to its corresponding mainchain D - A conjugated polymers . Using PBDT - TDPP - S as electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as electron acceptor , the resulting polymer solar cells exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a power conversion efficiency of 4.89 % , an open - circuit voltage of 0.84 V , a short - circuit current of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor of 56.0 % . Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention because of their potential for achieving large - area , flexible photovoltaic devices through lowcost solution processing techniques . 1 To date , solar power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 10.6 % and 9.2 % have been demonstrated in the cells with tandem and single junction structures , respectively , representing an important advance in the development of PSCs . 2 Many recent research efforts have been concentrated on the development of donor - acceptor (D - A) narrow band gap (NBG) polymers with broad absorption spectra . 3 Despite the great success of these D - A polymers in achieving high performance PSCs , further development of novel electron donor polymers is still in urgent need as the donor polymers play a decisive role in determining the device performance . Nowadays , most of the present polymers are in main - chain D - A frame , which may suffer from lower hole mobility due to the influence of acceptor units in the main chain . Aiming at investigating the effects of the D - A framework on device performance , Huang and co - workers proposed a new molecular design strategy toward side - chain D - A conjugated polymers , in which D moieties were employed to construct the main chain and A units were conjugatedly pended onto the D units in the side chain . 4 Compared to the corresponding main - chain D - A polymers , the side - chain ones mainly possesses three advantages . First , the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) energy levels of the side - chain polymers can preserve in a deeper position . Second , a two - dimensional - like structural feature renders this class of polymers with better solubility . Finally , there exists an internal charge transfer (ICT) behavior from the side - chain D - A structure , which can fine - tune the band gap (E g) of the resultant polymers as well as promote an isotropic charge transport along the polymeric main chain . As a result of these merits , PSCs based on these previously reported side - chain D - A polymers exhibited a maximal PCE of 4.74 % .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
