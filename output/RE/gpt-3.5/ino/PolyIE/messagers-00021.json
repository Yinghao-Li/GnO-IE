This approach has provided a remarkable short - circuit current density (J SC) of 16 mA / cm^2 , 3 whereas , in general , the V OC has suffered 4 because of a higher than the HOMO optimal energy level in order to pursue a lower bandgap . In the PSCs community , poly(2,7 - carbazole - altdithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) is one excellent exam - ple for a low HOMO (-5.45 eV) as required by the ' ideal ' πconjugated polymers , which led to a high V OC value over 0.8 V and outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures . 5 The initial PCE reached 3.6 % 6 in a typical BHJ device and has been subsequently improved to exceeding 6 % by BHJ layer thickness optimization and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures . 7 However , the bandgap of PCDTBT is still relatively larger than the proposed 1.5 - 1.7 eV of the ideal polymers for PCEs exceeding 10 % . Recently , to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT without sacrificing its high V OC , Hsu et al . 8 and our group 9 independently reported PCDTBT - based ladder - type polymers with forced planarity of which device performance showed impressive PCEs of up to 4.59 % with reduced bandgap (ca . 0.2 eV) in comparison with that of PCDTBT . However , the multiple synthetic steps for the ladder - type PCDTBTs have restricted the realization for their usage in BHJ devices . Herein , we present an easily obtainable selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , poly(2,7 - carbazole - alt - diselenienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDSeBT) by replacing thiophenes with selenophene rings in the polymer backbone . Such a structural modification would be expected the lower - lying LUMO with the HOMO being largely unaffected due to the individual effects of the smaller ionization potential (IP) and almost the same electronegativity of selenium relative to sulfur atom . 10 In addition , interchain - charge transfer should be facilitated by intermolecular Se ° ° ° Se contacts , most likely leading to a widen absorption band and enhanced mobility that are desirable for high photocurrents . 11 Our preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic properties of PCDSeBT in typical BHJ devices with [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) shows a highly respectrable PCE of 4.12 % on account of the high J SC and V OC . The synthetic routes to the monomers (M1 and M2) and PCDSeBT are shown in Scheme 1 . Compounds 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were synthesized according to the previously reported procedures . 5a,12 The diboronic ester monomer M1 was easily synthesized from precursor 3 , by dilithiation at -78 ° C , followed by quenching with 2 - iso - propoxy-4,4,5,5 - tetrametyl-1,3,2 - dioxaborolane in anhydrous THF in a yield of 79 % .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
