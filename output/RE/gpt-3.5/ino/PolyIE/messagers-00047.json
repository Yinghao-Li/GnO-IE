    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: The copolymers P1 - P5 emit weak fluorescence both in solution and in film with very large Stokes shifts (120 - 200 nm) (Figure 5) , suggesting that the polymers undergo considerable molecular rearrangement upon photoexcitation , leading to a big structural difference between the excited and ground states . 43,44 Electrochemical Properties . The redox behavior for P1 - P6 and small molecule 4b were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (Figure 6) . The monomer 4b shows a reversible reduction wave and an irreversible oxidation wave . The HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials , assuming the absolute energy level of ferrocene / ferrocenium to be 4.8 eV below vacuum , and the data are summarized in Table 2 . The LUMO of 4b is -3.12 eV , which is similar to that (ca . -3.23 eV) of n - type building block BTI (6 , Figure 1) . 27 As it is generally assumed that a high electron affinity (> 3 eV) is necessary for n - type materials , 4,45,46 we suggest that dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide functions as a n - type building block . However , compared to the very strong n - type building blocks PDI (1 , Figure 1) and NDI (2 , Figure 1) the imide moiety indeed significantly lowers the HOMO / LUMO . However , the LUMO of P6 is higher than that of BTI homopolymer (-3.47 eV) . 27 Copolymers P1 - P5 exhibit an irreversible reduction peak and an irreversible oxidation peak . The HOMO / LUMO of P1 is -5.55 / -2.78 eV ; the electron - rich unit benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b 0] dithiophene leads to upshifting of HOMO / LUMO levels compared to homopolymer P6 . The LUMO of P1 is higher than that of poly[thiopheneimide - alt - benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b 0] dithiophene] (-3.6 eV) , 20 indicating that the electron - withdrawing ability of dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide is weaker than that of thiophene imide (4 , Figure 1) . As a result of two more electrondonating thiophenes in the polymer backbone , the HOMO of P2 increases by 0.22 eV relative to that of P1 . P3 and P4 with weak electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole exhibit similar HOMO / LUMO levels to homopolymer P6 , while the stronger electronaccepting unit benzo [c][1,2,5]thiadiazole reduced the LUMO by 0.28 eV. The HOMO - LUMO gaps E g cv , estimated from electrochemistry , are larger than the optical bandgaps E g opt , very similar to that for BTI homopolymer and copolymer . 27 Photovoltaic Cells . To demonstrate potential application of dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide - based polymers in organic photovoltaics (OPV) , we chose P1 as an example to fabricate polymer solar cell devices because it possesses relatively broad absorption , proper HOMO / LUMO energy levels , and good solubility .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
