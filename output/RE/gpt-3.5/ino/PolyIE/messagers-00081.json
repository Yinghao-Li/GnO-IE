Figure 5 shows the typical output and transfer curves of a representative device with PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) as the channel semiconductor . The hole mobility was estimated to be 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of other effective D - A type low - bandgap photovoltaic polymers (2.6 x 10 ^ -4 -3 x 10 ^ -3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1) . 5 Although the FET mobility might not be directly correlated to the photovoltaic performance since the situation of the charge transport is quite different from each other , the higher carrier mobility still suggests effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes in the photovoltaic devices . Photovoltaic Properties . The bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PCBM (or PC 70 BM) / LiF / Al . PEDOT : PSS was spin - coated on a precleaned ITO - coated glass substrate . The film was dried at 150 ° C under a N 2 atmosphere for 5 min . After cooling the substrate , a solution of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM (or PC 70 BM) mixture (1 : 2 w / w) was spin - coated , where a blend of chloroform and o - dichlorobenzene (4 : 1 v / v) was used as the solvent . The devices were completed by evaporating LiF / Al as the cathode . The effective area (2 mm x 3 mm) of the PSCs was defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light (Scheme 2) . PC 70 BM was also used as an acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PCBM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region , which can compensate for the poor absorption of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) in this range . Figure 6 shows the I - V curves of the devices with the best photovoltaic performance under the illumination of AM 1.5 (100 mW / cm^2) . The corresponding open - circuit voltage (V OC) , short - circuit current (I SC) , fill factor (FF) , and PCE of the devices are also summarized in Figure 3 . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices under the illumination of monochromatic light is shown in Figure 3 . Compared with the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PCBM system , the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PC 70 BM system has higher EQE values of 30 - 40 % in the range of 450 - 850 nm , which contributes to the improvement of I SC from 11.31 to 14.87 mA / cm^2 . Since the spectral response extends to over 1.1 μm , the spectral mismatch between the simulated and actual AM1.5 spectra must be considered .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
