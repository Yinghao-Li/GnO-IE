    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: Compared with PzNDTDTBT , a bathochromic shift (∼ 15 nm) of the absorption peak of PzNDTDTBO is observed , indicating stronger ICT between the BO acceptor unit and NDT donor units . The stronger ICT within PzNDTDTBO is originated from a relatively stronger electron - withdrawing nature of BO unit compared to that of the BT one . In films , the absorption spectra of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are similar to those in solution , with obvious red - shifts (56 - 68 nm) of their absorption maxima as shown in Figure 3b , which is a common phenomenon for conjugated polymers , owing to the aggregation of the conjugated polymer main chains in the solid films . In addition , both PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO display prominent vibronic shoulders at shorter wavelengths , implying an ordered arrangement in their solid films , with strong π - π stacking between the polymeric backbonesa feature that also appears in the spectra of regioregular poly(3 - hexylthiophene) (P3HT) , which is beneficial to improve the charge mobility of resulting films . 21 The absorption edges for solid films of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are 703 and 704 nm , respectively , corresponding to nearly the same optical band gap (E g opt) of 1.76 eV. Compared with the reported copolymer PzNDTTPD , 14 both PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO show broader absorption spectra and smaller bandgaps , which can be attributed to the stronger electron - accepting ability of the BT / BO unit in the copolymer , and this is beneficial to increase the light - harvesting capacity for higher short - circuit current density (J sc) . 2d Electrochemical Properties . Cyclic voltammetry has been employed and considered as an effective tool in investigating electrochemical properties of conjugated organic molecules and polymers . 22 From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammogram , energy levels of HOMO and LUMO can be readily estimated , which correspond to ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) , respectively . Cyclic voltammogram of the polymer films are shown in Figure 4 . The onset oxidation potential (E ox) / onset reduction potential (E red) of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are 0.75 / -0.97 and 0.90 / -1.02 V vs Ag / AgCl , respectively . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer were The HOMO , LUMO , and electrochemical bandgaps (E g ec) of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO , calculated from the value of E ox and E red of the polymers , are -5.15 / -3.43 / 1.71 and -5.30 / -3.38 / 1.92 eV , respectively (see Table 2) . For the convenience of comparison , the optical and electrochemical parameters of the PzNDTTPD are also given in Table 2 . The electrochemical band gaps of the polymers match well with their optical band gaps within the experimental error .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
