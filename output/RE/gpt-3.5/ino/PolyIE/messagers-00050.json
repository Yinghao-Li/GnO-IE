    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: 23,24 In addition , the comparison of random terpolymers with different compositions to their parent polymers has been rarely explored ; 25 such studies are critical for understanding the compositional effect of random terpolymers on the device performance , in terms of charge generation , transport , and structural properties . The combination of the different electron - deficient units of pyrrolo [3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione (DPP) and thieno [3,4- c]pyrrole-4,6 - dione (TPD) can be ideal for producing broad light absorption due to the large difference between their electron - withdrawing strengths . 19,22 In addition , both units have been successfully used in D - A copolymers to produce high - performance PSCs . 26 - 33 While electron - withdrawing TPD possesses a relatively simple , symmetric , and planar structure suitable for D - A copolymers in PSCs , DPP exhibits very strong electron - withdrawing effect due to the presence of electrondeficient lactam rings and strong π - π interactions . 19,34 Herein , we report a series of novel random poly[thienyl - substituted benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene - pyrrolo [3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4dione - thieno [3,4 - c]pyrrole-4,6 - dione]copolymers (PBDTT- DPP - TPD) based on one electron - rich unit , thienylsubstituted benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene (BDTT) , and two electron - deficient units , DPP and TPD , that have complementary and broad light absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm . This is a much broader absorption than other reported random terpolymers , 23,24 endowing a great potential for improving the PSC performance and providing an ideal system for studying the compositional effect of the random terpolymers on the PSC performance . While the ratio of DPP to TPD influenced the optical behavior of the random terpolymers , the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the polymers showed a nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % . The best PCE value of 6.33 % was obtained from the blend device of PBDTT - DPP75 - TPD25 and [6,6]-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) , with a short - circuit current density (J SC) higher than 16 mA / cm^2 . To understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the PCE , the optical , electrical , and structural properties of these random terpolymers with different ratios of DPP to TPD were systematically investigated . stated , all of the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received . The weight - average molecular weight (M w) , number - average molecular weight (M n) , and polydispersity index (PDI) of P1- P7 were measured by SEC with o - dichlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 ° C. The characteristics of the polymers are summarized in Table 1 . To determine the actual ratio between DPP and TPD in the random terpolymers , they were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . The 1H NMR spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure S1 . The peak of the butyloctyl chains adjacent to the lactam N atom of DPP appeared around 4.09 ppm and the signal of the octyl chains adjacent to TPD appeared around 3.77 ppm .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
