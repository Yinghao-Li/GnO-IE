    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: The decent hole mobilities of both copolymers can be attributed to high crystallinity of the copolymers due to the highly coplanar structure of anthracene and DPP . It is also understood that the 3 - fold higher chargecarrier mobility of PTATDPP than that of PTAFDPP arises from its stronger π - π stacking with a shorter d 010 , as discussed above . When the photovoltaic properties of copolymers are measured using PC71BM as an electron acceptor , it is found that the optimum blend ratio of polymer : PC71BM is 1 : 2 to afford the best PCE of both copolymers with the conventional device architecture of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al (Fig . S2 and Table S1 †) . The best PCE was also achieved when o - dichlorobenzene was used as a solvent and the optimum thickness for the active layer was ca . 90 nm . The current density - voltage (J - V) characteristics of the optimized solar cells are shown in Fig . 4 , and the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Tables 2 and S2 . † PTATDPP showed a best PCE of 6.69 % (V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 12.3 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.68) , while PTAFDPP showed a best PCE of 5.02 % (V OC = 0.76 V , J SC = 11.2 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.59) . Both copolymers showed higher V OC s than other DPP - based copolymers due to their low - lying HOMO energy levels . Both copolymers also exhibited high J SC s and FFs , indicating their decent ability for charge generation and transport . Therefore , the TA unit is a promising electron - donating unit for low band - gap copolymers with a low - lying HOMO energy level . When the PSC devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture (ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag) in order to further improve the photovoltaic performance , the PCEs of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP - based devices were improved to 7.02 % and 5.22 % , respectively (Fig . 4b , Tables 2 and S2 †) , mainly due to enhanced J SC s (V OC s and FFs were not changed significantly) . It is noteworthy here that the PCE of over 7 % of PTATDPP is the highest efficiency of anthracene - based low band - gap conjugated copolymers . In spite of the same band - gap of the two copolymers , PTATDPP shows slightly higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP (Fig . S3 †) . This can be ascribed to the closely packed microstructures of PTATDPP and thereby its high charge - carrier mobility than PTAFDPP . When the crystal structures of blend films of the copolymers with PC71BM were examined by XRD , the PTATDPP / PC71BM blend had strong and intense (100) diffraction while the PTAFDPP / PC71BM blend showed weak and broad (100) diffraction (Fig . 2b) .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
