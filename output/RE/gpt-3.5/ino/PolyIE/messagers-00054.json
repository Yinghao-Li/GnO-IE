    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: Because the lamellar spacing in P1 (19.2 Å) was smaller than in P7 (24.1 Å) , the length of the side chains in BDTT is not the main factor in determining the lamellar spacing in P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 ; the lamellar spacing is mainly determined by the length of the side chains in DPP and TPD . As more TPD was introduced into the polymer backbone , the domain spacing of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 gradually increased from 19.2 , 20.1 , 21.9 , 22.7 to 24.1 Å , respectively . This is likely due to the increased amount of structurally longer alkyl side chains of TPD . Figure S8 shows that the pristine polymers exhibited a distinctive arc scattering of the (010) peak along the out - of - plane direction at q = 1.62- 1.68 Å -1 , corresponding to π - π stacking . The π - π stacking is more prominent in the out - of - plane direction , which suggests that most of the polymer backbones are oriented parallel to the substrates . The π - π stacking distances of polymers were 3.85 , 3.86 , 3.84 , 3.85 , and 3.74 Å for P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 , respectively . The combination effects of the DPP to TPD ratio with changes in the alkyl chain could affect the π - π stacking distance of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 and backbone planarity , thus influencing their charge transport properties . The π - π stacking feature of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 in the blended films was significantly changed by the addition of PCBM , as shown in Figure 6 . No π - π stacking diffraction was observed in P1 , P3 , and P4 , and only a faint π - π stacking diffraction pattern in the out - of - plane direction appeared for P5 . However , P7 had a prominent π - π stacking peak even after the addition of PCBM , indicating that the polymer backbone adopts a preferential \" face - on \" orientation relative to the substrate . In spite of the \" face - on \" orientation of P7 , its mobility was observed to be slightly lower compared to the other polymers , which is most likely due to the presence of fewer percolating pathways for hole transport . 54 Therefore , the GIXS patterns revealed that the incorporation of the different units of DPP and TPD affects the polymeric ordering (i.e. , domain spacing) as well as its direction . For further characterization , the BHJ morphology of the polymer blends was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) . The resulting AFM and TEM images are shown in Figure 7 and Figure S9 , respectively . The images of P1 , P3 , P4 , and P5 blends showed bicontinuous structures of polymer and PCBM as well as small - scale phase separation favorable for exciton dissociation .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
