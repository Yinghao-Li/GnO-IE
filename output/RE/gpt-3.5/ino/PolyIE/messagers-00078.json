    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: A highly effective photovoltaic polymer with near - infrared response , poly{N- [3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione-5 0 , 5 00 -diyl} {PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) } , was synthesized . The polymer has high molecular weight , good solubility , and a broad absorption spectrum in the range of 500 - 1100 nm . Field effect transistor charge mobility of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) arrived 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Bulk heterojunction type polymer solar cells based on PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PC 70 BM have broad photocurrent response wavelength range from 300 nm to 1.1 μm . High short - circuit current (14.87 mA / cm^2) and power conversion efficiency (2.71 %) were achieved , which is a significant advance for efficient photovoltaic polymers that respond to the whole range of the solar spectrum . In the past decade , polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received a great deal of attention as a potential renewable energy source due to their potential advantages such as low fabrication cost , light weight , and fast production of large area devices by roll - to - roll solution processes . 1 Among photovoltaic polymers , regioregular poly(3 - hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been extensively studied . Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic device combining P3HT as the electron donor with [6,6]-phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron acceptor have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 4 - 5 % . 2 However , the upper limit seems to have been reached for this material combination , as P3HT utilizes only photons located in the highenergy fraction of the solar spectrum with wavelengths below 650 nm . In fact , ∼ 40 % of the total solar energy lies in the range of 650 - 1100 nm , which is a strong driving force for developing lowbandgap polymers to utilize the solar energy in the near - infrared (NIR) range . 3 Recently , significant progress has been made in the photovoltaic application of novel low - bandgap polymers with optical absorption wavelengths in the range of 700 - 900 nm . 4 Nevertheless , design of efficient photovoltaic polymers with optical absorption and photocurrent response extending to wavelengths of micrometers remains challenging . The first example of this kind of micrometer - response polymer (μmR - polymer) was APFO - Green1 , reported by Ingan € as et al . in 2004.^5 Subsequently , considerable effort has been devoted to the design and synthesize of μmR - polymers via a synthetic strategy of combining electronrich units (donors) and electron - deficient units (acceptors) in a copolymer main chain . To date , no more than 10 μmR - polymers have been synthesized , which are primarily based on a very strong electron - deficient unit such as [1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4 - g]quinoxaline , 6 thienopyrazine , 7 or thieno [3,4 - c][1,2,5]thiadiazole .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
