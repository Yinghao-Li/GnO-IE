Conjugated polymers can be classified as hole (p - type) or electron (n - type) transporting materials according to the type of orderly transferring charge carriers . Most of conjugated polymers are p - type semiconductors that have seen a dramatic rise in performance over the past decade while much less attention has been devoted to n - type semiconducting polymers that have lagged behind their p - type counterparts . 2 Organic n - type materials are essential for the fabrication of organic p - n junctions , OPVs , n - channel OFETs , OLEDs , and complementary logic circuits . 3 The n - type building blocks are the core components in n - type semiconducting polymers . Aromatic imides such as rylene diimides are one of the classical n - type building blocks and can exhibit relatively high electron affinities , high electron mobilities , and excellent chemical , thermal , and photochemical stabilities . 4 These materials are electron deficient due to the substitution of an aromatic core with one or two sets of π - accepting imide groups that are mutually conjugated . The widely used rylene diimides include perylene diimides (PDIs , 1) and naphthalene diimides (NDIs , 2) (Figure 1) . Zhan and co - workers reported the synthesis of the first soluble rylene - based fully conjugated polymer . 5 Top - gate OFETs based on this PDI- dithienothiophene copolymer exhibited a saturation electron mobility (μ e) of 6 x 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , current on / off ratio (I on / I off) of 10 ^ 4 , and a low threshold voltage (V th) of 7 V in air . 6 Moreover , all - polymer solar cells based on blends of polythiophene derivative donors and PDI - dithienothiophene copolymer acceptors exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 1.5 % (AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2) . 7 - 9 Facchetti et al . reported a conjugated copolymer of NDI and bithiophene ; 10 OFET devices based on this polymer fabricated in a top - gate , bottom - contact configuration with polymeric dielectrics exhibited μ e of 0.1 - 0.85 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 under ambient conditions with I on / I off > 10 ^ 5 . 11 The simplest aromatic imide system is phthalimide (3) and thiophene imide (4) (Figure 1) . A few literatures reported phthalimide - containing conjugated polymers such as poly-(phenylene ethynylene)s , 12 a polyaniline derivative , 13 and a polythiophene derivative .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
