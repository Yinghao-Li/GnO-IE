    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: Taking into account the fact that both IDT and NT are comparatively rigid coplanar structures along the polymer backbone , the IDT - NT based polymers may suffer solubility issue since the tetraoctylbenzene groups attached to the carbon bridges of IDT unit would not be enough to guarantee their solubility in common organic solvents . Therefore , the spacers consist of thiophene or bithiophene functionalized with various alkyl side chains were introduced in between IDT and NT units to improve the solubility of the resulting polymers , which may also potentially lead to improved molecular weight that is favorable for the optimal morphology and charge carrier transport . 39 - 41 We notice that the incorporated side chains may also increase the dihedral angle of their contiguous aromatic units , 42,43 which may somewhat inhibit polymer backbone planarity and thereby increase band gap and lower the charge carrier mobility . 40,41 However , it should be tried several different alkyl side chains to achieve a delicate balance of the molecular weight , solubility as well as planarity of polymers as no comprehensive rule has yet emerged of the influences of specific side chains . 44,45 It was realized that by switching the spacer between the IDT and NT units , the processability , backbone planarity , charge carrier mobility and film morphology can be optimized . Further investigation of photovoltaic performances indicates all devices present high V oc because of the relatively deep HOMO energy levels of these polymers , and the highest PCE of 5.05 % was achieved based on PIDT - C12NT . Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA ; see Figure 1) were used to probe thermal properties . No phase transition was observed for all three polymers by DSC analysis up to 300 ° C. All polymers have decomposition temperature (defined as the 5 % weight - loss temperature , T d) over 450 ° C under nitrogen as determined by TGA analysis , indicating their excellent thermal stabilities . Optical and Electrochemical Properties . The UV - vis absorption spectra of all polymers in both chlorobenzene solution (1 × 10 ^ -3 mg mL -1) and as thin films (spin - casted from chlorobenzene solutions with concentration of 8 mg mL -1) are shown in Figure 2 . All three polymers exhibit dual characteristic absorption bands , where the short wavelength absorbance originated from the π - π * transition of the IDT unit , while the long wavelength absorbance could be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the IDT and the NT segments . 27 In chlorobenzene (CB) solution , PIDT - EHNT showed an absorption maximum at 599 nm and a slightly weaker peak at 433 nm ; when changing the branched 2ethylhexyl to linear hexyl side chain , the resulted polymer PIDT - DTNT showed a slightly bathochromic shift of two corresponding peaks to 608 and 439 nm , respectively , which may due to the reduced steric hindrance of the linear side chain .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
