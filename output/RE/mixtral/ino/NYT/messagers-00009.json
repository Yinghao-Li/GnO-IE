Sunni Arab allies: This phrase refers to a group of countries that are predominantly Sunni Muslim and Arab. It's difficult to specify the exact nationalities mentioned here, as the phrase is somewhat vague. However, it could potentially include countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Bahrain, among others.\n3. Europe: This is a continent, not a country, so it doesn't have a specific nationality. However, it's possible that the paragraph is referring to the European Union or to European countries in general. If so, the nationalities could include a wide range of possibilities, depending on which countries are being referred to.\n4. Iran: This is a country, so the nationality would be Iranian.\n5.
