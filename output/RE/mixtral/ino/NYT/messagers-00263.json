This suggests that Hank and Arleen Pavony are not from Israel, and since Steven Pavony's nationality is not explicitly stated, it is reasonable to assume that he shares the same nationality as his parents. Additionally, the use of English in the paragraph, which is not the official language of Israel, further supports this inference."},
