Developing world (broadest)\n2. Africa (narrower)\n3. India (narrower)\n4. Bihar (narrower still)\n5. Baharbari (most specific)\n\nTherefore, the location of \"Bihar\" is broader than \"Baharbari\" and encompasses it, while \"Baharbari\" is a more specific location within the state of Bihar. Similarly, the location of \"India\" is broader than \"Bihar\" and encompasses it, while \"Bihar\" is a more specific location within India.
