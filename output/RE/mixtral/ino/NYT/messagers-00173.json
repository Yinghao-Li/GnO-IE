Martin Feldstein: The nationality of Martin Feldstein is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, but he is described as a professor of economics at Harvard University, which is located in the United States. It is therefore reasonable to assume that Martin Feldstein is American.\n2. Richard Musgrave: Like Martin Feldstein, Richard Musgrave's nationality is not explicitly stated in the paragraph. However, the fact that he is described as having transformed economics in the 1950s and 1960s suggests that he was active in the academic world during that time period. Since the United States was a major center of economic research during that time, it is likely that Richard Musgrave was also American.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is reasonable to assume that both Martin Feldstein and Richard Musgrave are American."},
