Gaza, on the other hand, is mentioned separately and is described as having been taken over by Hamas. The implication is that Gaza is a distinct geographical location that is different from the West Bank.\n4. The paragraph suggests that Israel may withhold financial support for Gaza due to the Hamas takeover, but would still provide financial support to the West Bank to help Fatah. This further reinforces the idea that the West Bank and Gaza are two separate and distinct geographical locations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the West Bank is a more specific geographical location that is encompassed within the broader concept of the Palestinian territories. Gaza is a separate and distinct geographical location that is also part of the Palestinian territories, but is not encompassed within the West Bank."},
