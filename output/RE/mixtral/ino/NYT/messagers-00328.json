Mr. Blair: The text does not provide information about the first name or specific details about Mr. Blair, making it difficult to determine his birthplace. There are several individuals with the surname Blair, and they could be of different nationalities.\n3. Stanley Fischer: The text mentions that Stanley Fischer is the governor of the Bank of Israel.
