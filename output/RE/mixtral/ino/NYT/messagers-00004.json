The paragraph also mentions that the Syrian government is providing support to radical organizations, specifically Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories.\n3. Hezbollah is a political party and militant group based in Lebanon, and its leader is Hassan Nasrallah. Therefore, \"Individual X\" in this context could potentially refer to Hassan Nasrallah as the leader of Hezbollah.\n4. Hamas is a Palestinian Sunni Islamist militant organization, and its leader is Ismail Haniyeh.
