Since North Dakota is a state in the United States, it is likely that they are American, but the paragraph does not explicitly state this.\n3. The remaining players, aside from goalie Kellen Briggs, are all Minnesotans. Minnesotans are citizens or residents of Minnesota, a state in the United States. Therefore, it is likely that these players are American, but the paragraph does not explicitly state this.\n4. Goalie Kellen Briggs is from Colorado Springs, which is a city in the state of Colorado in the United States. Therefore, it is likely that Kellen Briggs is American, but the paragraph does not explicitly state this.\n\nIn summary, the paragraph mentions people from Austria (Thomas Vanek) and the United States (the rest of the players, including those from Minnesota and Colorado Springs). The nationalities of Grant and Ryan Potulny and Kellen Briggs are not explicitly stated, but they are likely to be American."},
