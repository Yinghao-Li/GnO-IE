It is clear that these two locations are being used to describe the political affiliations of Sheldon Whitehouse and Claire McCaskill, respectively.\n3. However, the paragraph does not explicitly state the hierarchical relationship between these two locations.\n4. To determine the relationship, we need to consider our background knowledge about the structure of political divisions in the United States.\n5. We know that states (in this case, Rhode Island and Missouri) are political subdivisions of the country, and that senators are elected to represent their respective states at the federal level.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that Rhode Island is a broader, more encompassing geographical location than the city or town where Sheldon Whitehouse resides, while Missouri is also a broader, more encompassing geographical location than the city or town where Claire McCaskill resides.\n\nIn conclusion, both Rhode Island and Missouri are states, which are broader and more encompassing geographical locations than the specific cities or towns where the individuals mentioned in the paragraph reside."},
