The paragraph does not explicitly mention his nationality, but it does mention that he is the proprietor of a French Quarter antique shop called Lucullus. This suggests that he is likely of French or French-American descent, but it does not definitively state his nationality.\n2. The second person mentioned in the paragraph is Paris. However, Paris is a place, not a person, so it does not have a nationality.\n3. The third person mentioned in the paragraph is France, which is a country and therefore has the nationality of French.\n\nIn summary, the paragraph mentions one person (Patrick Dunne) whose nationality is not explicitly stated, one place (Paris) which does not have a nationality, and one country (France) which has the nationality of French."},
