No specific nationality is mentioned for Pellman, so we cannot extract any nationality from this name alone.\n2. The next part of the paragraph mentions that Pellman attended medical school in Guadalajara, Mexico. Guadalajara is a city in Mexico, so we can infer that the medical school Pellman attended is located in Mexico.\n3. However, attending medical school in a particular country does not necessarily mean that the student is from that country. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Pellman is Mexican based on this information alone.\n\nTo summarize, we can extract the nationality \"Mexican\" from the location of the medical school mentioned in the paragraph, but we cannot definitively say that Pellman is Mexican based on the information provided."},
