    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: A new series of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) conjugated random terpolymers ( PBDTT-DPP-TPD ) were synthesized from electron - rich thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDTT ) , in conjugation with two electron - deficient units , pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) and thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) , of different electron - withdrawing strengths. The optical properties of these random terpolymers can be easily controlled by tuning the ratio between DPP and TPD ; an increase in TPD induced increased absorption between 400 and 650 nm and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level , while higher DPP contents resulted in stronger absorption between 600 and 900 nm. The best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.33% was obtained from PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 with [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) due to the improved light absorption and thus a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) higher than 16 mA / cm^2. Interestingly , the trend observed in the PCE values differed from that of optical behavior of the PBDTT-DPP-TPD in terms of the DPP to TPD ratio , showing nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6% . Density functional theory calculations showed that the small portions of strong electron - withdrawing DPP in PBDTT-DPP25-TPD75 and PBDTT-DPP10-TPD90 could provide trap sites , which suppress efficient charge transfer. In contrast , for PBDTT-DPP90-TPD10 and PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 , the effect of minor portions of TPD on electron density distribution was found to be minimal. In addition , the polymer packing and nanomorphology were investigated by grazing - incidence X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. The findings suggested that controlling the ratio of electron - deficient units in the random terpolymers is critical for optimizing their performance in polymer solar cells because it affects the polymer packing structure , the optical and electrical properties , and the electron distribution in the polymers . Low-band-gap polymers for bulk - heterojunction (BHJ)-type polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have been studied intensively with the aim of matching a greater part of the solar spectrum and thus harvesting more photon flux , to produce efficiencies greater than 7-9 % . 1-9 In most cases , low-band-gap polymers achieved by the donor - acceptor ( D-A ) approach do not show broad absorption , but instead the absorption maxima are redshifted , decreasing the number of absorbed photons in the visible region and ultimately limiting the achievable photocurrent. 10-13 One promising approach toward broadening the absorption of the solar spectrum is to develop random terpolymers based on the copolymerization of two different electron - rich units and one electron - deficient unit 14-16 or one electron - rich unit and two different electron - deficient units. 17-22 The judicious selection of two different electrondeficient or - rich groups with different electron - withdrawing or - donating strengths is critical to achieve complementary and broad visible light absorption , thus maximizing photon harvesting. However , successful examples of random terpolymers with broad light absorption and high efficiency are limited.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
