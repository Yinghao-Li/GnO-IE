Here , the atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was applied to investigate the morphology of the blend film of the polymer : PC 70 BM fabricated from CB and DCB solutions , respectively , as shown in Fig. 3. For PDTP-BT : PC 70 BM , both CB and DCB gave the films with obvious phase separation with a root mean square ( RMS ) of 2.222 nm and 0.880 nm , respectively , which might be due to the poor miscibility of the two materials. For PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT , the blend film of polymer / PC 70 BM spin - coated from CB was also rough , but the blend films fabricated from DCB displayed a much smoother surface with a RMS of 0.188 nm and 0.259 nm , respectively. This smaller roughness of the blend film indicates that the domain size of the phase separation of the donor - acceptor interpenetrating network could be reduced , which could be beneficial for the exciton charge separation and charge transport. These results indicate that the morphologies of these polymers with PC 70 BM are quite sensitive to the solvents used for device processing and the introduction of a thienyl spacer could improve the miscibility . The photovoltaic properties of the three copolymers PDTP-BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT were studied by fabricating bulk heterojunction BHJ - type PSCs with a conventional sandwich configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC 70 BM / Ca / Al. The effective areas of the PSCs , contributing to photocurrent , were defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light. The devices were optimized by changing many factors , such as the ratio of the donor and the acceptor , the thickness of blend films and the cathode metal. The best performance was obtained with the thickness of the active layer of 80-90 nm , the copolymers : PC 70 BM ratio of 1 : 2 ( by weight ) and the Ca / Al used as the cathode. Fig. 4 shows the J-V curves of the optimized PSCs based on the three polymers under illumination of AM 1.5 simulated solar light ( 100 mW cm^-2 ). The PSCs with two kinds of solvents CB and DCB for the spin - coating of the active layers were investigated , and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short - circuit current density ( J SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) and PCE are summarized in Table 2. When CB was used as the solvent , all the combinations showed a relatively low PCE of 0.87% , 1.97% and 1.92% in the devices with PDTP-BT : PC 70 BM , PDTP - DTBT : PC 70 BM and PDTP-DT2BT : PC 70 BM respectively.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
