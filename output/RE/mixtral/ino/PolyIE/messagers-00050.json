The combination of the different electron - deficient units of pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) and thieno [ 3,4- c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) can be ideal for producing broad light absorption due to the large difference between their electron - withdrawing strengths. 19,22 In addition , both units have been successfully used in D-A copolymers to produce high - performance PSCs. 26-33 While electron - withdrawing TPD possesses a relatively simple , symmetric , and planar structure suitable for D-A copolymers in PSCs , DPP exhibits very strong electron - withdrawing effect due to the presence of electrondeficient lactam rings and strong π-π interactions. 19,34 Herein , we report a series of novel random poly[thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione]copolymers ( PBDTT- DPP - TPD ) based on one electron - rich unit , thienylsubstituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDTT ) , and two electron - deficient units , DPP and TPD , that have complementary and broad light absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm. This is a much broader absorption than other reported random terpolymers , 23,24 endowing a great potential for improving the PSC performance and providing an ideal system for studying the compositional effect of the random terpolymers on the PSC performance.

Random terpolymers: A series of novel random poly[thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione]copolymers (PBDTT- DPP - TPD) are reported. These terpolymers are based on one electron-rich unit (thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene or BDTT) and two electron-deficient units (pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) and thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)). The terpolymers have complementary and broad light absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm, which is much broader than other reported random terpolymers.\n2. Electron-deficient units: DPP has a very strong electron-withdrawing effect due to the presence of electron-deficient lactam rings and strong π-π interactions. TPD, on the other hand, has a relatively simple, symmetric, and planar structure suitable for D-A copolymers in PSCs. The combination of DPP and TPD in the terpolymers provides broad light absorption due to the large difference between their electron-withdrawing strengths.\n3. Device performance: The ratio of DPP to TPD influences the optical behavior of the random terpolymers, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the polymers shows a nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6%. The best PCE value of 6.33% was obtained from the blend device of PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), with a short-circuit current density (JSC) higher than 16 mA/cm^2.\n4. Molecular weights: The weight-average molecular weight (Mw), number-average molecular weight (Mn), and polydispersity index (PDI) of P1-P7 were measured by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with o-dichlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 °C. The characteristics of the polymers are summarized in Table 1 (not provided in the paragraph).\n5. Chemicals: All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received.\n6. NMR and elemental analysis: To determine the actual ratio between DPP and TPD in the random terpolymers, they were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The 1H NMR spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure S1 (not provided in the paragraph). The peak of the butyloctyl chains adjacent to the lactam N atom of DPP appeared around 4.09 ppm, and the signal of the octyl chains adjacent to TPD appeared around 3.77 ppm."},
