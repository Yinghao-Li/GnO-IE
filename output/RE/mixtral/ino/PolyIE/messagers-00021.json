This approach has provided a remarkable short - circuit current density ( J SC ) of 16 mA / cm^2 , 3 whereas , in general , the V OC has suffered 4 because of a higher than the HOMO optimal energy level in order to pursue a lower bandgap. In the PSCs community , poly(2,7-carbazole-altdithienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDTBT ) is one excellent exam - ple for a low HOMO ( -5.45 eV ) as required by the ' ideal ' πconjugated polymers , which led to a high V OC value over 0.8 V and outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures. 5 The initial PCE reached 3.6% 6 in a typical BHJ device and has been subsequently improved to exceeding 6% by BHJ layer thickness optimization and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures. 7 However , the bandgap of PCDTBT is still relatively larger than the proposed 1.5 - 1.7 eV of the ideal polymers for PCEs exceeding 10% . Recently , to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT without sacrificing its high V OC , Hsu et al. 8 and our group 9 independently reported PCDTBT - based ladder - type polymers with forced planarity of which device performance showed impressive PCEs of up to 4.59% with reduced bandgap ( ca. 0.2 eV ) in comparison with that of PCDTBT. However , the multiple synthetic steps for the ladder - type PCDTBTs have restricted the realization for their usage in BHJ devices. Herein , we present an easily obtainable selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-diselenienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDSeBT ) by replacing thiophenes with selenophene rings in the polymer backbone. Such a structural modification would be expected the lower - lying LUMO with the HOMO being largely unaffected due to the individual effects of the smaller ionization potential ( IP ) and almost the same electronegativity of selenium relative to sulfur atom. 10 In addition , interchain - charge transfer should be facilitated by intermolecular Se°°°Se contacts , most likely leading to a widen absorption band and enhanced mobility that are desirable for high photocurrents. 11 Our preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic properties of PCDSeBT in typical BHJ devices with [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) shows a highly respectrable PCE of 4.12% on account of the high J SC and V OC . The synthetic routes to the monomers ( M1 and M2 ) and PCDSeBT are shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were synthesized according to the previously reported procedures. 5a,12 The diboronic ester monomer M1 was easily synthesized from precursor 3 , by dilithiation at -78 °C , followed by quenching with 2-iso-propoxy-4,4,5,5-tetrametyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane in anhydrous THF in a yield of 79% .\n\nLet's think step by step."},

A short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16 mA/cm² has been achieved, but the open-circuit voltage (VOC) has suffered due to a higher than optimal energy level.\n\n2. PCDTBT (poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole)): This polymer has a low HOMO energy level of -5.45 eV, leading to a high VOC of over 0.8 V and stability against oxidation at high temperatures. The initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) was 3.6%, but it has been improved to over 6% with optimization of the BHJ layer thickness and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures. The bandgap of PCDTBT is around 1.9 eV, which is larger than the ideal 1.5-1.7 eV for PCEs exceeding 10%.\n\n3. Ladder-type PCDTBT polymers: Independently reported by Hsu et al. and another group, these polymers have a reduced bandgap (ca. 0.2 eV) compared to PCDTBT, with impressive PCEs of up to 4.59%. However, their multiple synthetic steps limit their usage in BHJ devices.\n\n4. PCDSeBT (poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-diselenienylbenzothiadiazole)): This selenophene analogue of PCDTBT has a lower lying LUMO and a largely unaffected HOMO due to the individual effects of smaller ionization potential (IP) and almost the same electronegativity of selenium relative to sulfur atom. Interchain charge transfer is facilitated by intermolecular Se°°°Se contacts, leading to a wider absorption band and enhanced mobility. Preliminary investigation of PCDSeBT in typical BHJ devices with PC71BM shows a PCE of 4.12%.\n\n5. Monomers M1 and M2: The diboronic ester monomer M1 is synthesized from precursor 3 with a yield of 79%. The synthetic routes to the monomers and PCDSeBT are shown in Scheme 1.
