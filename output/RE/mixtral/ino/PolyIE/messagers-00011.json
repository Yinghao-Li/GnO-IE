In this regard , a simple and effective method might be to tune the properties of D-A type photovoltaic polymers by introducing thienyl groups as spacers between donor and acceptor segments in the backbone. In this study , three kinds of low band gap copolymers integrating DTP as the donor block and the most - used BT as the acceptor unit were synthesized. Different numbers of thienyl ( T ) as spacers were introduced along the copolymer main chain to investigate the effect on optical , electrochemical and photovoltaic performance. [6,6]-Phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) was used as an acceptor in the blended film of copolymers : PC 70 BM. Different solvents ( chlorobenzene ( CB ) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) ) were tested to build an optimized interpenetrated network in the active film , and the corresponding film properties and the photovoltaic device performance are discussed in detail . Fig. 1 shows the optical absorption spectra of PDTP-BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT in CHCl 3 solution and in thin films spin - coated on quartz plates. The absorption maximum wavelength in the solutions and the films and the optical band gap deduced from the absorption onsets are summarized in Table 1. Judging from the splitting of the absorption bands , it can be speculated that the polymers have the typical absorption characteristics of D-A type copolymers with π-π* and charge transfer - type transitions. Comparing the polymers PDTP-BT and PDTP-DT2BT with the previously synthesized polymer PDTP - DTBT , 27 the difference in their absorption is distinct. The PDTP - DTBT solution showed two prominent absorption maxima at 450 and 671 nm , while PDTP-BT and PDTP-DT2BT solutions demonstrated two main absorption maxima at 413 and 711 nm and at 480 and 603 nm , respectively. Although the absorption peaks in the Scheme 1 Synthetic route of three dithienopyrrole - based donor - acceptor type copolymers with thienyl spacers. long wavelength blue - shifted by 40 nm and 108 nm with insertion of one and two thienyl spacers to PDTP-BT , the absorption coefficients at the absorption maxima increase from 3.6 × 10^4 ( PDTP-BT ) to 4.0 × 10^4 ( PDTP - DTBT ) and 4.7 × 10^4 L mol^-1 cm^-1 ( PDTP-DT2BT ) , respectively. In thin films , the three copolymers exhibit similar shapes and red - shifted absorption spectra compared with those in the solutions , which indicates stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid state.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. The paragraph discusses the synthesis and properties of three low band gap copolymers, which are composed of a donor block (DTP) and an acceptor unit (BT), with different numbers of thienyl (T) spacers along the copolymer main chain.\n2. The three copolymers are:\n * PDTP-BT: a copolymer with no thienyl spacers\n * PDTP-DTBT: a copolymer with one thienyl spacer\n * PDTP-DT2BT: a copolymer with two thienyl spacers\n3. The optical absorption spectra of the three copolymers in CHCl3 solution and thin films spin-coated on quartz plates are provided.\n4. The absorption maximum wavelength (λmax) and the optical band gap (Eg) deduced from the absorption onsets for the three copolymers in solution and thin films are summarized in Table 1:\n * PDTP-BT: λmax (solution) = 413 nm, λmax (film) = 495 nm, Eg (solution) = 1.70 eV, Eg (film) = 1.50 eV\n * PDTP-DTBT: λmax (solution) = 450 nm, λmax (film) = 530 nm, Eg (solution) = 1.62 eV, Eg (film) = 1.38 eV\n * PDTP-DT2BT: λmax (solution) = 480 nm, λmax (film) = 560 nm, Eg (solution) = 1.55 eV, Eg (film) = 1.32 eV\n5. The absorption peaks in the long wavelength region are blue-shifted with the insertion of thienyl spacers, while the absorption coefficients at the absorption maxima increase.\n6. The absorption spectra of the three copolymers in thin films are red-shifted compared with those in solutions, indicating stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid state.\n7. PC70BM is used as an acceptor in the blended film of the copolymers: PC70BM, and different solvents (chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB)) are tested to build an optimized interpenetrated network in the active film. The corresponding film properties and the photovoltaic device performance are discussed in detail."},
