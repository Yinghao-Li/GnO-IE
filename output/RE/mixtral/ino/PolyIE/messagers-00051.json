The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / LiF / Al , where the polymers ( P1- P7 ) were used as electron donors and PC71BM ( or PC61BM ) was used as an electron acceptor. To optimize the morphology and ordering structure , different volume percentages of 1,8diiodooctane were added. 43 Figure 4 shows the current density versus voltage ( J-V ) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW / cm^2. The V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE values of the PSC devices are summarized in Table 3. From P1 to P4 , PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor , but for P5 , P6 , and P7 , PC61BM was used as the electron acceptor. P5 , P6 , and P7 blended with PC61BM showed higher PCE values than when they were blended with PC71BM in spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , which is most likely due to the lower miscibility of those polymers with PC71BM. 44 The V OC of these random terpolymers increased in the order P2 ( 0.74 V ) ∼ P3 ( 0.74 V ) < P4 ( 0.76 V ) < P5 ( 0.79 V ) < P6 ( 0.82 V ). The trend in the V OC of the PSCs can be explained by the HOMO energy level of the polymers because the V OC is typically linearly proportional to the difference in energy between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor. 45 However , the PCE of the random terpolymers showed a the nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6% in the order P3 ( 5.61% ) > P4 ( 5.26% ) > P2 ( 4.91% ) > P5 ( 3.02% ) > P6 ( 2.09% ) ; this was consistent with the observed trend of the J SC . P3 exhibited the highest PCE value of 5.61% among all polymers , including P1 and P7 , which was attributed to the broad absorption and increased V OC due to the deeper HOMO energy level.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. HOMO and LUMO energy levels of polymers P1-P7:\n   - The HOMO energy levels of P1-P7 are -5 eV (relative to the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple, which is 4.80 eV below the vacuum level). The exact values for the LUMO energy levels are not provided, but they can be calculated by subtracting the energy gap (Eg) from the HOMO energy level.\n\n2. Exciton binding energy and energy gap of polymers:\n   - The exciton binding energy of organic conjugated materials causes Eg (from CV measurements) to be slightly larger than Eg (from OPT measurements) in all polymers.\n\n3. Photovoltaic properties of PSC devices:\n   - The devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al, where polymers P1-P7 were used as electron donors and PC71BM or PC61BM as electron acceptors.\n   - Different volume percentages of 1,8-diiodooctane were added to optimize the morphology and ordering structure.\n   - The current density versus voltage (J-V) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW/cm^2 are shown in Figure 4.\n   - The Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE values of the PSC devices are summarized in Table 3.\n\n4. Comparison between polymers P1-P7:\n   - Polymers P5, P6, and P7 blended with PC61BM showed higher PCE values than when blended with PC71BM, despite the better light absorption of PC71BM. This is most likely due to the lower miscibility of those polymers with PC71BM.\n   - The Voc of the PSCs increases in the order P2 (0.74 V) ∼ P3 (0.74 V) < P4 (0.76 V) < P5 (0.79 V) < P6 (0.82 V).\n   - The PCE of the random terpolymers shows a nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6% in the order P3 (5.61%) > P4 (5.26%) > P2 (4.91%) > P5 (3.02%) > P6 (2.09%).\n   - P3 exhibits the highest PCE value of 5.61% among all polymers, which is attributed to the broad absorption and increased Voc due to the deeper HOMO energy level.\n\nIn summary, the text discusses the photovoltaic properties of seven polymers (P1-P7) used in PSC devices with different electron acceptors (PC71BM or PC61BM). The devices' Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE values vary among the polymers. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers are not explicitly provided but can be calculated using the given energy gap values. The exciton binding energy of the organic conjugated materials causes Eg (from CV measurements) to be slightly larger than Eg (from OPT measurements) in all polymers."},
