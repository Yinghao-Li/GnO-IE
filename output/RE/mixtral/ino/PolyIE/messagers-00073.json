This kind of side - chain donor - acceptor ( D-A ) polymer exhibited better solution processability , lower HOMO level ( -5.34 eV ) , and more balanced carrier mobility relative to its corresponding mainchain D-A conjugated polymers. Using PBDT-TDPP-S as electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as electron acceptor , the resulting polymer solar cells exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a power conversion efficiency of 4.89% , an open - circuit voltage of 0.84 V , a short - circuit current of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor of 56.0% . Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted significant attention because of their potential for achieving large - area , flexible photovoltaic devices through lowcost solution processing techniques. 1 To date , solar power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) of 10.6% and 9.2% have been demonstrated in the cells with tandem and single junction structures , respectively , representing an important advance in the development of PSCs. 2 Many recent research efforts have been concentrated on the development of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) narrow band gap ( NBG ) polymers with broad absorption spectra. 3 Despite the great success of these D-A polymers in achieving high performance PSCs , further development of novel electron donor polymers is still in urgent need as the donor polymers play a decisive role in determining the device performance. Nowadays , most of the present polymers are in main - chain D-A frame , which may suffer from lower hole mobility due to the influence of acceptor units in the main chain. Aiming at investigating the effects of the D-A framework on device performance , Huang and co-workers proposed a new molecular design strategy toward side - chain D-A conjugated polymers , in which D moieties were employed to construct the main chain and A units were conjugatedly pended onto the D units in the side chain. 4 Compared to the corresponding main - chain D-A polymers , the side - chain ones mainly possesses three advantages. First , the highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) energy levels of the side - chain polymers can preserve in a deeper position. Second , a two - dimensional - like structural feature renders this class of polymers with better solubility. Finally , there exists an internal charge transfer ( ICT ) behavior from the side - chain D-A structure , which can fine - tune the band gap ( E g ) of the resultant polymers as well as promote an isotropic charge transport along the polymeric main chain. As a result of these merits , PSCs based on these previously reported side - chain D-A polymers exhibited a maximal PCE of 4.74% .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
