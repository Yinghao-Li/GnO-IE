The lower bandgap with the broaden absorption band significantly improves a J SC of 11.7 mA / cm^2 , which is among the highest J SC values for PSCs based on PCDTBT derivatives , while the low HOMO energy level maintains the high V OC value. The corresponding PCE is 4.12% , about 37% higher than that obtained from a PCDTBT - based reference device. This work provides a feasible strategy for selective fine - tuning of LUMO levels , which achieves a high J SC value , while nearly remaining a high V OC . Therefore , further exploration of PCDSeBT - based PSCs is still warranted for high - performance PCEs by means of controlling the film morphology and improving electric contacts .\n\nLet's think step by step."},

Material: PCDSeBT (Poly[2,6'-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-alt-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene])\n\nProperties:\n\n* Wider absorption band due to strong intermolecular Se°°°Se interactions\n* Lower bandgap\n* Broadened absorption band\n* High J SC (short-circuit current density) value of 11.7 mA/cm^2\n* Low HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level, which helps maintain a high V OC (open-circuit voltage) value\n* Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.12%, which is about 37% higher than that of a PCDTBT-based reference device\n\nThese properties make PCDSeBT a promising material for use in organic solar cells, as it can provide high J SC values while maintaining high V OC values, leading to improved PCEs. Further exploration of PCDSeBT-based solar cells is encouraged to optimize film morphology and electric contacts for even higher PCEs."},
