The energy levels , absorption spectra and band gaps of the resulting polymers were well tuned by utilizing different thiophene derivatives as spacer between IDT and NT units , and polymer PIDT-C12NT which employed bithiophene attached with dodecyl side chain as spacer exhibited superior properties compared to the other two copolymers. All polymers exhibited deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and subsequently lead to high open circuit voltages of fabricated solar cell devices. Best performance of the bulk - heterojunction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 5.05% was achieved with PIDT-C12NT as donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor , which can be attributed to its higher charge carrier mobility , the optimized interpenetrating network as well as enhanced absorption coefficient of photoactive layer with respect to the other two polymers. The results demonstrated that the combination of IDT and NT with appropriate spacers was a promising molecular design strategy for the application of solar cells . During the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted extensive attention due to their lightweight , low cost and great potential for the fabrication of large - area flexible devices. 1-3 PSCs based on bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) architecture are of particular interests since high performance devices with power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) exceed 8% can be achieved. 4-9 Typical BHJ devices comprise a phaseseparated donor / acceptor blend layer with low band gap conjugated polymers as the electron donor , and fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as the electron acceptor. 10,11 Generally , when considering that open circuit voltage ( V oc ) is related to the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level of donor materials and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of acceptor , 12,13 deep HOMO levels for low band gap conjugated polymers are preferred in order to attain high V oc . However , lowering HOMO level would result in larger band gap , and thereby the absorption of resulted polymers would have less overlap with solar spectrum , which are unfavorable for high short circuit current ( J sc ). To obtain the ideal low band gap polymer with appropriate energy levels that can make a tradeoff between open circuit voltage ( V oc ) and band gap so as to maximize the PCE , an intriguing approach involves incorporat - ing electron rich moieties ( donor , D ) and electron deficient moieties ( acceptor , A ) and alternating them on the backbone , which are so - called D-A type low band gap conjugated polymers.\n\nLet's think step by step."},

Three donor-acceptor type narrow band gap conjugated polymers were synthesized through Stille copolymerization of indacenodithiophene (IDT) and naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) (NT) based monomers.\n2. The energy levels, absorption spectra, and band gaps of the resulting polymers were tuned by using different thiophene derivatives as spacers between IDT and NT units.\n3. Polymer PIDT-C12NT, which has bithiophene attached with a dodecyl side chain as a spacer, exhibited superior properties compared to the other two copolymers.\n4. All polymers have deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, leading to high open-circuit voltages (Voc) in fabricated solar cell devices.\n5. The best performance of the bulk-heterojunction solar cells was achieved with PIDT-C12NT as the donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor, with a power conversion efficiency of 5.05%.\n6. This performance can be attributed to PIDT-C12NT's higher charge carrier mobility, optimized interpenetrating network, and enhanced absorption coefficient in the photoactive layer.\n7. The combination of IDT and NT with appropriate spacers is a promising molecular design strategy for solar cell applications.\n8. Over the past decade, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained extensive attention due to their lightweight, low cost, and potential for large-area flexible devices.\n9. PSCs based on bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) architecture are of particular interest, with high-performance devices achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCE) over 8%.\n10. Typical BHJ devices consist of a phase-separated donor/acceptor blend layer with low band gap conjugated polymers as the electron donor and fullerene derivatives such as PC61BM or PC71BM as the electron acceptor.\n11. Open-circuit voltage (Voc) is related to the difference between the HOMO energy level of donor materials and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of acceptor materials.\n12. Deep HOMO levels for low band gap conjugated polymers are preferred to attain high Voc, but lowering the HOMO level would result in a larger band gap, reducing the absorption's overlap with the solar spectrum, which is unfavorable for high short-circuit current (Jsc).\n13. To create an ideal low band gap polymer with appropriate energy levels that can balance Voc and band gap to maximize PCE, an intriguing approach is to incorporate electron-rich moieties (donor, D) and electron-deficient moieties (acceptor, A) and alternate them on the backbone, known as D-A type low band gap conjugated polymers."},
