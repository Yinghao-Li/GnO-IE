PFDTBT showed a maximum PCE of 2.2% , and PFDTBT derivatives containing branched alkyl chains ( BisDMO - PFDTBT ) showed higher PCEs. 10,11 Some molecules and polymers that have flat structures such as fluorene , 12-16 anthracene , 17 and pyrene 18,19 have been reported to form excimers or aggregates by strong interchain π-π interactions. Excimer formation could affect the emission properties of molecules or polymers , therefore , the excimer or exciplex formation has been used as a fluorescence probe for molecular recognition. 19 In organic photovoltaic devices , π-π interactions between low - band gap donor polymers are important for charge transportation. Enhanced π-π interactions in p - type donor polymers could improve their chargetransport ability , and thus increase short - circuit currents in solar cells. In this study we report on a new approach to improve PCE of OPVs by enhancing the interchain π-π interaction. To do this we introduced flat perylene units into the conjugated polymers. We synthesized poly[2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] ( PFDTBT ) , poly[2,2′-(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)dithiophene-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] ( PFD2TBT ) , and their ter-polymers with perylene units. Optical , electrical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated. Synthetic routes and polymer structures are shown in Schemes 1 and 2 . The UV - visible absorption spectra of the synthesized polymers were recorded in both chloroform solution and as a solid thin film. PFDTBT and the ter-polymer solutions exhibited two distinct absorption bands , where the first absorption peak is at around 387 nm , corresponding to the π-π* transition of the conjugated polymer backbone , 23,24 and the second absorption band in the longer wavelength region at around 530 nm , can be attributed to the strong internal charge - transfer ( ICT ) interaction between donating and accepting groups in the main chain. 21 Peak and edge positions were almost equivalent for PFDTBT , PFDTBT_5Per and PFDTBT_10Per , but the maximum absorption peak for PFDTBT_20Per moved to a shorter wavelength region. This might be due to a decrease in the internal charge - transfer ( ICT ) interaction cause by a decreased content of electron - withdrawing DTBT monomer in the copolymer. PFD2TBT and the ter-polymer solutions also exhibited two absorption bands at around 410 and 520 nm. The absorption maxima and edges of the polymer solutions showed little dependence upon perylene contents. The UV - visible absorption spectra of the synthesized polymers in a chloroform solution are shown in Figure 2.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
