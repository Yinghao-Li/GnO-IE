The field - effect mobility was calculated in the saturation regime using the following equation : I ds = ( W / 2 , where I ds is the drain - source current in the saturated region , W and L are the channel width and length , respectively , μ is the field - effect mobility , C i is the capacitance per unit area of the insulating layer , and V gs and V th are the gate and threshold voltages , respectively. 28,29 Interestingly , the fieldeffect mobility increased with an increase in the number of perylene units in the corresponding parent polymers. The fieldeffect mobility for PFDTBT , PFDTBT-5Per , PFDTBT-10Per , and PFDTBT-20Per was determined to be 1.0 × 10^-4 , 1.2 × 10^-4 , 5.3 × 10^-4 , and 1.2 × 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively. Similarly , the measured field - effect mobility of PFD2TBT , PFD2TBT-5Per , and PFD2TBT-10Per was 2.7 × 10^-6 , 1.1 × 10^-5 , and 2.1 × 10^-5 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively. This result suggests that the introduction of the flat perylene structure to PFDTBT and PFD2TBT plays an important role in increasing the carrier mobility , possibly due to the enhanced interchain π-π interaction. The characteristics of the TFTs using the polymers as the active layers are summarized in Table 3. 2L)μC i ( V gs - V th ) 3.6. Photovoltaic Properties. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using PFDTBT , PFD2TBT and the ter-polymers as p - type electron donors and by using [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as an n - type acceptor. Two different types of photovoltaic devices were fabricated and characterized , with the device structures of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al and ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al shown in Figure 6. The solutionprocessable titanium suboxide ( TiO x ) layer was employed as an optical spacer 30,31 and as a hole blocker 27 between the bulk heterojunction(BHJ) layer and the top metal electrode. Figure 7 shows the current - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices. It can be observed that the open circuit voltages of cells fabricated using PFDTBT and its ter-polymers range from 0.70 to 0.77 V. The device fabricated using PFDTBT showed higher open circuit voltages than those of perylene-containing copolymers. This coincides with the relative HOMO energy levels of the polymers. As the perylene content in the copolymers increased , the amount of DTBT contents decreased , and so the HOMO of the polymers moved to higher energy levels. PFDTBT has the deepest HOMO energy level , thus it showed the highest open circuit voltage ( 0.77 V ).\n\nLet's think step by step."},

The field-effect mobility (μ) of the polymers used as the active layer in the devices is as follows:\n   - PFDTBT: 1.0 × 10^-4 cm^2 / (V s)\n   - PFDTBT-5Per: 1.2 × 10^-4 cm^2 / (V s)\n   - PFDTBT-10Per: 5.3 × 10^-4 cm^2 / (V s)\n   - PFDTBT-20Per: 1.2 × 10^-3 cm^2 / (V s)\n   - PFD2TBT: 2.7 × 10^-6 cm^2 / (V s)\n   - PFD2TBT-5Per: 1.1 × 10^-5 cm^2 / (V s)\n   - PFD2TBT-10Per: 2.1 × 10^-5 cm^2 / (V s)\n\n2.

The relative HOMO energy levels of the polymers influence the open-circuit voltages of the devices. PFDTBT has the deepest HOMO energy level, resulting in the highest open-circuit voltage (0.77 V). As the perylene content in the copolymers increases, the amount of DTBT contents decreases, causing the HOMO of the polymers to move to higher energy levels."},
