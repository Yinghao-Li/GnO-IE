In addition , two different DPP derivatives flanked with thiophene ( TDPP ) and furan ( FDPP ) were used to further optimize the energy levels and photovoltaic properties of the copolymer. 27 Both polymers exhibit a low band - gap of 1.65 eV , a deep HOMO energy level of -5.45 eV and a high hole mobility of ca. 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Interestingly , a nanoscale BHJ morphology in the blend of the copolymer and PC71BM was well developed without the addition of a processing additive. The solar cell devices fabricated from the copolymers and PC71BM exhibited high PCEs of 7.0% and 5.2% for PTATDPP and PTAFDPP , respectively. Furthermore , the PSC fabricated from the blend of PTATDPP and a non-fullerene electron acceptor ( di-PBI ) showed a promising PCE of 4.23% , demonstrating that PTATDPP has good compatibility with multiple electron acceptors for high efficiency PSCs . The number - average molecular weights ( M n ) of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP were 47.2 and 32.6 kDa with polydispersity indexes ( PDI ) of 2.1 and 2.5 , respectively , as determined by size - exclusion chromatography. PTATDPP and PTAFDPP show the absorption maxima ( λ max ) at 654 nm and 666 nm in solution , respectively , as shown in Fig. 1a , while the two copolymers exhibit nearly the same Scheme 1 Synthesis of monomers for polymerization. absorption onset at 750 nm corresponding to the optical bandgap of 1.65 eV. Both copolymers also exhibit distinct vibronic shoulder peaks at 710 nm which are derived from the coupling of the electronic and vibrational transition. Therefore , these vibronic shoulder peaks at lower energy provide the evidence of strong π-π interactions , indicating that polymer chains are aggregated in the solution state. As compared to the solution state , the absorption onsets in the solid state are extended to 770 nm while the vibronic shoulders become stronger , indicating that both polymer chains exhibit a strong tendency to selfassemble in the solid state , which may induce crystallization. 37 This strong self - assembly of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP arises mainly from highly coplanar nature of the polymer backbone. Therefore , the two copolymers are expected to possess high crystallinity in the solid film state , which is beneficial to efficient charge transport in the device.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
