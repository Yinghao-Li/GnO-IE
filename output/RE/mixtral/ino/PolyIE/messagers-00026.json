    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: However , the rms roughness is somewhat reduced to from 0.47 to 0.43 nm with thermal treatment , being favorable for charge separation and transport. This can reasonably explain the enhanced efficiency via the postannealing effect. Note that , in stark contrast to PCDTBT : PC71BM system in which thermal annealing reduced the photovoltaic parameters ( FF , J SC , and V OC ) , 22 the performance of all PCDSeBT - based devices for this study is considerably improved as a result of thermal treatment. We can conclude that the formation of crystalline nanoscale domains would be slightly induced in PCDSeBT : PC71BM with a thermal treatment in consequence of the ordered crystalline nature of the PCDSeBT on annealing as supported by the XRD results above as well as the large quinoidal character in the polymer backbone as the inclusion of selenophene. 23 The AFM of the annealed film gives an evidence for slightly nanofibril - like organization ( see Figure 5b ). The hole and electron mobilities of PCDSeBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 w / w ) blends were measured using the space - charge - limited current ( SCLC ) method and the J-V characteristics were plotted in Figure 6. The hole mobility ( μ hole = 4.68 × 10^-5 cm^2 / V°s ) obtained with the thermally annealed film is one order higher than that without post annealing ( μ hole = 4.02 × 10^-6 cm^2 / V°s ) , whereas in the both cases , the electron mobilities ( μ electron ) are similar ( 1.24 × 10^-3 and 5.58 × 10^-3 cm^2 / V°s ) for as-cast and annealed films , respectively , yielding a smaller difference between the mobility ratio for the annealed film. The higher mobilities and more balanced charge transport should definitely favor the charge transportation in the blend film and lead to high solar cell performance , supporting the b e n e fi c i a l e ff e c t o f t h e t h e r m a l a n n e a l i n g o n PCDSeBT : PC71BM cells . In conclusion , diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ( DSeBT ) units have successfully been incorporated into a D-A polymer backbone by Suzuki polymerization with 2,7-carbazole comonomer , affording a poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-diselenienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDSeBT ) ; This design motif is that replacement of thiophenes to selenophene units in PCDTBT that acts as a superior p - type photoactive material for PSCs , induces a lower bandgap ( 1.70 eV ) than that of PCDTBT ( 1.85 eV ) , while the ideal HOMO energy level ( -5.40 eV ) is still maintained.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
