Therefore , the spacers consist of thiophene or bithiophene functionalized with various alkyl side chains were introduced in between IDT and NT units to improve the solubility of the resulting polymers , which may also potentially lead to improved molecular weight that is favorable for the optimal morphology and charge carrier transport. 39-41 We notice that the incorporated side chains may also increase the dihedral angle of their contiguous aromatic units , 42,43 which may somewhat inhibit polymer backbone planarity and thereby increase band gap and lower the charge carrier mobility. 40,41 However , it should be tried several different alkyl side chains to achieve a delicate balance of the molecular weight , solubility as well as planarity of polymers as no comprehensive rule has yet emerged of the influences of specific side chains. 44,45 It was realized that by switching the spacer between the IDT and NT units , the processability , backbone planarity , charge carrier mobility and film morphology can be optimized. Further investigation of photovoltaic performances indicates all devices present high V oc because of the relatively deep HOMO energy levels of these polymers , and the highest PCE of 5.05% was achieved based on PIDT-C12NT . Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ; see Figure 1 ) were used to probe thermal properties. No phase transition was observed for all three polymers by DSC analysis up to 300 ° C. All polymers have decomposition temperature ( defined as the 5% weight - loss temperature , T d ) over 450 °C under nitrogen as determined by TGA analysis , indicating their excellent thermal stabilities. Optical and Electrochemical Properties. The UV - vis absorption spectra of all polymers in both chlorobenzene solution ( 1 × 10^-3 mg mL -1 ) and as thin films ( spin - casted from chlorobenzene solutions with concentration of 8 mg mL -1 ) are shown in Figure 2. All three polymers exhibit dual characteristic absorption bands , where the short wavelength absorbance originated from the π-π* transition of the IDT unit , while the long wavelength absorbance could be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the IDT and the NT segments. 27 In chlorobenzene ( CB ) solution , PIDT - EHNT showed an absorption maximum at 599 nm and a slightly weaker peak at 433 nm ; when changing the branched 2ethylhexyl to linear hexyl side chain , the resulted polymer PIDT - DTNT showed a slightly bathochromic shift of two corresponding peaks to 608 and 439 nm , respectively , which may due to the reduced steric hindrance of the linear side chain.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
