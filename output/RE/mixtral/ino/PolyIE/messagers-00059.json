Since the open - circuit voltage V oc of bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs is positively correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , a higher V oc for PzNDTDTBObased polymer solar cells could be anticipated due to the lowerlying HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO. 24 Photovoltaic Properties. To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the NDT - based semiconductor , PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated. Figure 5 shows the current density - voltage characteristic of PSCs based on the blends of polymer : PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW cm^-2 . To further study the performance of the PSC devices , the hole mobilities in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method using devices with structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au at the optimized blend ratio of polymer / PC71BM. For unipolar transport in a trap - free semiconductor with an ohmic injecting contact , the SCLC can be approximated by the Mott - Gurney equation : ε ε μ γ ≅ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ J V L V L 9^8 exp 0.891 r 0^0 2^3 ( 3 ) Here J is the current density , ε r is the dielectric constant of the polymer , ε 0 is the free - space permittivity ( 8.85 × 10^-12 F / m ) , μ 0 is the charge mobility at zero field , γ is a constant , L is the thickness of the blended film layer , V = V appl - V bi , V appl is the applied potential , and V bi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode ( in this device structure , V bi = 0.2 V ). Figure 6 displays the ln(JL 3 / V 2 ) vs ( V / L ) 0.5 curve for the measurement of the hole mobility of the blend films of PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) and PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM ( 1.5 : 1 , w / w ) by the SCLC method. According to eq 3 , the hole mobilities obtained are as high as 3.3 × 10^-3 and 4.4 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO , respectively. Obviously , from the viewpoint of hole mobility , PzNDTDTBO is more suitable ( higher than 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) for the application as photovoltaic donor materials in PSCs.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) energy level of PzNDTDTBO is 0.15 eV lower than that of PzNDTDTBT. This is due to the replacement of the BT unit with the more electron-accepting BO unit, which has a stronger electronegativity than the sulfur atom.\n2. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) is positively correlated with the difference between the LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer. Therefore, a higher Voc for PzNDTDTBObased polymer solar cells can be anticipated due to the lower HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO.\n3. The photovoltaic properties of the NDT-based semiconductor were investigated using PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al.\n4. The hole mobilities in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method using devices with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au at the optimized blend ratio of polymer / PC71BM.\n5. The SCLC can be approximated by the Mott-Gurney equation, where J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10^-12 F / m), μ0 is the charge mobility at zero field, γ is a constant, L is the thickness of the blended film layer, V = Vappl - Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential.\n6. The hole mobilities obtained for PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are 3.3 × 10^-3 and 4.4 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1, respectively.\n\nIn summary, PzNDTDTBO has a lower HOMO energy level than PzNDTDTBT, which can lead to a higher Voc in PSCs. Additionally, PzNDTDTBO has a higher hole mobility (4.4 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1) than PzNDTDTBT (3.3 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1), making it more suitable for the application as photovoltaic donor materials in PSCs."},
