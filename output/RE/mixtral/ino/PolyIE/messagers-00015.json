The newly developed DTPD moiety was carefully designed to lower a band gap via strong interaction between donor - acceptor moieties and keep polymer energy levels deep. Remarkably , the DTPD acceptor moiety effectively widens the light absorption range of the polymers up to âˆ¼ 900 nm while positioning their HOMO and LUMO levels in the optimal range , i.e. , -5.3 and -4.0 eV , respectively , for high power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as we intended. Solar cell devices were fabricated according to the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / photoactive ( polymer : PC 70 BM ) / TiO 2 / Al. The POBDTPD devices exhibited a PCE of 4.7% with a V oc of 0.70 V , a J sc of 10.6 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.64. The PEBDTPD devices yielded a higher PCE of 5.3% with a V oc of 0.72 V , a J sc of 13.5 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.54. AFM , TEM , and PL quenching measurements revealed that the high J sc s are a result of the appropriate morphology and efficient charge separation. In comparing the performances of the two polymer devices , the higher J sc for the PEBDTPD device was attributed to its better nanoscale phase separation , smoother surface , and higher carrier mobility in the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films. The higher FF for the POBDTPD device was ascribed to a good balance between the hole and electron mobilities. Overall , we demonstrate that the DTPD unit is a promising electron - accepting moiety to develop high performance low band gap polymers . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted great attention for their potential utility in the production of large - area , low - cost , and flexible photovoltaic devices via solution processing. 1-4 To achieve high power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) , electrondonor polymers should have the following desirable characteristics : ( i ) good absorption spectral overlap with the solar spectrum , ( ii ) optimal energy level alignment with respect to electron - acceptor fullerene derivatives ( typically [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 60 BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) ) to facilitate efficient exciton separation , ( iii ) formation of a nanoscale interpenetrating network of the polymer and fullerene domains inside the photoactive layer , and ( iv ) provision of effective charge transport carriers toward the electrodes. To meet these requirements , intensive research efforts have been focused on integrating electron - rich donor units and electron - deficient acceptor units into a single conjugated polymeric system.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. The two new donor-acceptor type low band gap polymers developed are POBDTPD and PEBDTPD. The donor moiety is dialkoxybenzodithiophene (BDT) and the acceptor moiety is N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5-azacyclopenta[a]pentalene-4,6-dione (DTPD).\n2. The DTPD moiety has a band gap of approximately 1.3 eV, which is lower than most low band gap polymers, due to strong interaction between the donor and acceptor moieties.\n3. The HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) levels of both polymers are -5.3 eV and -4.0 eV, respectively, which is in the optimal range for high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).\n4. The solar cell devices were fabricated using the structure ITO/ PEDOT:PSS/ photoactive (polymer:PC 70 BM)/ TiO2/ Al.\n5. The POBDTPD devices exhibited a PCE of 4.7% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 10.6 mA/cm2, and a FF of 0.64.\n6. The PEBDTPD devices yielded a higher PCE of 5.3% with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 13.5 mA/cm2, and a FF of 0.54.\n7. The higher Jsc for the PEBDTPD device is attributed to its better nanoscale phase separation, smoother surface, and higher carrier mobility in the polymer:PC 70 BM blend films.\n8. The higher FF for the POBDTPD device is due to a good balance between the hole and electron mobilities.\n\nIn summary, the two new polymers POBDTPD and PEBDTPD have a low band gap of approximately 1.3 eV, optimal HOMO and LUMO levels of -5.3 eV and -4.0 eV, respectively, and show promising PCEs of 4.7% and 5.3%, respectively. The performance of the devices depends on the appropriate morphology, efficient charge separation, better nanoscale phase separation, smoother surface, and higher carrier mobility."},
