These results are explained by their much more planar conformations in the solid state. 10 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram of PCZDTB and PQCDTB , which were measured in 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate acetonitrile. As reported by Lidzey et al. , the PCZDTB oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potential were + 1.09 and -1.37 V , respectively , and the HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.44 and -2.98 eV. In the case of PQCDTB , unlike the PQA2T ( poly[quinacridone-bithiophene] ) reported by Takimiya et al. , a clear oxidation - reduction peak was observed. 19 This type of result has been obtained because PQCDTB was D-A structured , unlike the typical p - type structure of PQA2T. In PQCDTB , the oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potentials were + 0.89 and -1.36 V , respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.24 and -2.99 eV , respectively. Table 2 summarizes the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers. As shown in Table 2 , the HOMO level of PQCDTB ( -5.24 eV ) was higher than that of PCZDTB by 0.2 eV because the HOMO level of the QC derivative was higher than that of carbazole. The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference between the HOMO energy levels and the optical bandgap energies. According to the calculations , the LUMO levels of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were -3.32 and -3.46 eV , respectively. They slightly differed from the levels calculated through CV , but they mostly exhibited a similar tendency. Figure 4 shows the band diagram of the energy levels that have been obtained through DFT calculations and experiments. The bandgap energies of PQCDTB and PCZDTB determined through UV - vis spectra were reported as 1.98 and 1.92 eV , respectively , which were lower than the results of the DFT calculation by 0.57 and 0.55 V. 28 Because the HOMO level is lower than the P3HT HOMO level ( -4.9 eV ) in both polymers , a relatively high air stability could be obtained. 29 In the case of PQCDTB , the LUMO level ( -3.32 eV ) was higher than the PC71BM LUMO level ( -4.0 eV ) by 0.68 eV. However , the HOMO level ( -5.24 eV ) was lower than the PEDOT : PSS HOMO level ( -5.0 eV ) by 0.24 eV. Therefore , if charge separation occurs after receiving light energy , a hole would exhibit more effective charge transport than an electron in the active layer of PQCDTB. 14,26 Figure 5 and Table 3 show the results of evaluating the characteristics of an OPV device.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. PQCDTB and PCZDTB are two polymers with red-shifted maxima absorption spectra compared to their solution form, due to their more planar conformations in the solid state.\n2. PCZDTB has an oxidation onset potential (Eox onset) of +1.09 V and a reduction onset potential (E red onset) of -1.37 V, with HOMO and LUMO levels of -5.44 eV and -2.98 eV, respectively.\n3. PQCDTB has a D-A (donor-acceptor) structure, unlike the typical p-type structure of PQA2T. Its Eox onset is +0.89 V, E red onset is -1.36 V, HOMO level is -5.24 eV, and LUMO level is -2.99 eV.\n4. The HOMO level of PQCDTB is higher than that of PCZDTB by 0.2 eV, and the LUMO levels of PQCDTB and PCZDTB are -3.32 eV and -3.46 eV, respectively.\n5. The bandgap energies of PQCDTB and PCZDTB, determined through UV-vis spectra, are 1.98 eV and 1.92 eV, respectively, which are lower than the results of DFT calculation by 0.57 V and 0.55 V.\n6. Both polymers have a lower HOMO level than the P3HT HOMO level (-4.9 eV), indicating a relatively high air stability.\n7. In PQCDTB, the LUMO level (-3.32 eV) is higher than the PC71BM LUMO level (-4.0 eV) by 0.68 eV, but the HOMO level (-5.24 eV) is lower than the PEDOT:PSS HOMO level (-5.0 eV) by 0.24 eV. This suggests that a hole would exhibit more effective charge transport than an electron in the active layer of PQCDTB.\n\nNote: The numerical values are in units of electron volts (eV) or wavelength (nm) as provided in the paragraph."},
