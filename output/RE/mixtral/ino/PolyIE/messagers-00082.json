The calculated I SC from the EQE was 15% less than the measured I SC . This discrepancy might be attributed to the spectral mismatch in the NIR region and / or device degradation during measurements in air. The highest PCE of PSCs based on the PDTP-DTDPP-(Bu) : PC 70 BM system reached 2.71% , which was lower than the 4-5 % of the P3HT : PCBM devices. This could be mainly attributed to the lower V OC ( ∼ 0.4 V ). In addition , the charge separation efficiency in the current combination might not be as high as that in P3HT : PCBM , although it was difficult to estimate the internal quantum efficiency ( IQE ) accurately due to the light interference effect in the films. This might be attributed to the smaller LUMO offset or less ideal mixing morphology between the polymer and PCBM. Nevertheless , this performance is more than double of the highest PCE ( 1.1% ) reported to date for μmR - polymers , even when the spectral mismatch in the NIR region above was considered. Such improvement of PCE comes from relatively highefficiency photon - to - electron conversion in the broad range of the absorption in the blend film of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM. Considering the high EQE obtained in the range from 650 to 950 nm , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) is a promising candidate for applications in tandem photovoltaic devices in combination with conventional visible light absorbing materials. Furthermore , comparing the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) with PDTP - DTDPP(EH) suggests that the alkyl chain in the DPP segment has a large influence on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers. A similar phenomenon was also observed for other D-A type photovoltaic polymers. 12 Synthesis of new μmR - polymers with different alkyl chain in both the DTDPP segment and the dithieno[3,2-b : 2^0 ,3 0 -d]pyrrole segment and a detailed comparison of the properties of all these polymers are now in progress. The energy loss from the low output voltage of the photovoltaic devices ( 0.38 - 0.4 V ) can be attributed to the relatively large difference between the LUMO levels of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM ( i.e. , small energy difference between the HOMO of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and LUMO of PCBM ). There is still a room to lower the LUMO level of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) from 3.63 to ∼ 4.0 eV , which is ∼ 0.3 eV higher than the LUMO level of PCBM. If we can control the mixing morphology suitable for the charge separation , this energy offset might be enough to maintain a sufficient driving force for charge transfer and the higher V OC could be expected at the same time.\n\nLet's think step by step."},

The experimental short-circuit current (I SC) under AM1.5 irradiation is compared to the I SC calculated by integrating the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the actual AM1.5 solar spectra. The calculated I SC from the EQE is 15% less than the measured I SC.\n2. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on the PDTP-DTDPP-(Bu) : PC 70 BM system is 2.71%, which is lower than the 4-5 % of the P3HT : PCBM devices, mainly due to the lower open-circuit voltage (V OC) of approximately 0.4 V.\n3. The charge separation efficiency in the current combination might not be as high as that in P3HT : PCBM, possibly due to the smaller lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) offset or less ideal mixing morphology between the polymer and PCBM.\n4. The performance is more than double the highest PCE (1.1%) reported to date for μmR-polymers, and the improvement comes from relatively high-efficiency photon-to-electron conversion in the broad range of the absorption in the blend film of PDTP-DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM.\n5.
