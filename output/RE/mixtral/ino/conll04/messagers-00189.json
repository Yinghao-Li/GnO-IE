The person or entity causing harm is typically referred to as the \"killer,\" while the person or entity harmed is referred to as the \"victim.\"\n\nFor example, in the following paragraph, the \"Killer kills the Victim\" relationship can be identified as follows:\n\nParagraph: Yesterday, a man was shot and killed outside a convenience store in Los Angeles. The suspect, who has not yet been apprehended, approached the victim and shot him multiple times before fleeing the scene.\n\nKiller: The suspect\nVictim: The man who was shot and killed"},

In this case, the answer is \"Yes\" because the suspect shot the victim multiple times, resulting in his death."}
