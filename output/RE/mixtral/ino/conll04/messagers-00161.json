The title mentions \"Esprit Project\" and \"Duesseldorf.\"\n\nFrom the title alone, it's challenging to identify a clear relationship between an organization and its headquarters or primary location. However, we can infer that the \"Esprit Project\" is likely associated with Duesseldorf, Germany, as the city is mentioned in the title.\n\nEsprit is a well-known global fashion brand, but the use of \"Project\" suggests that this could be a specific initiative or collaboration. The fact that the project is mentioned before Duesseldorf implies that the project is the main focus of the article, and Duesseldorf is mentioned to provide context.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the Esprit Project has some connection to Duesseldorf, either as its headquarters or a significant location for the project's operations. However, without further information, we cannot confirm the exact nature of this relationship."},
