There is no explicit mention of an organization being headquartered or primarily operating in a specific location. However, we can infer that the Soviet Union is the organization in this case, and the location is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be the Soviet Union based on the context.\n\nTherefore, the pattern that can be identified in this text is the use of the term \"Soviet\" to refer to an organization (the Soviet Union), and the mention of a specific location (China) where the organization's representative (Eduard A. Shevardnadze) is visiting. This pattern suggests a relationship where the organization (the Soviet Union) is headquartered or primarily operates in a specific location (which can be inferred to be the Soviet Union)."},
