In the given text, the phrase \"soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash.\" indicates a relationship between an organization (soldiers) and a location (Fort Lewis, Washington).\n2. The phrase \"from\" is a key word that shows this relationship. It indicates that the soldiers are affiliated with or originate from Fort Lewis, which is located in Washington State.\n3. The numbered location (\"Wash.\") further confirms that Fort Lewis is in the state of Washington.\n4. The text also implies that Fort Lewis is the primary location where these soldiers are trained and prepared for deployment, as they are sent to Oregon for \"on-the-job training\" before being sent to the \"front lines.\"\n5. Therefore, we can infer that Fort Lewis is both the headquarters and primary operational location for these soldiers."},
