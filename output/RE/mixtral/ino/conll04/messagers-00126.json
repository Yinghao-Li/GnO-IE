Identify the locations: The firefighting crews are primarily operating in Idaho, Oregon, California, and Washington. The Boise Interagency Fire Center is located in Boise, Idaho.\n3. Analyze the relationships: The fact that the West's forest firefighting crews are on the front lines in specific states indicates that these organizations primarily operate in those locations. The Boise Interagency Fire Center, which is directing the firefights, is headquartered in Boise, Idaho, and is overseeing the operations in the other states.\n\nPatterns that indicate this type of relationship include:\n\n* Mention of an organization (in this case, the West's forest firefighting crews) operating in a specific location (Idaho, Oregon, California, and Washington)\n* Mention of an organization's headquarters (the Boise Interagency Fire Center) in a specific location (Boise, Idaho)\n* Mention of the organization (the Boise Interagency Fire Center) overseeing or directing operations in other locations (Idaho, Oregon, California, and Washington)\n* Mention of the organization (the West's forest firefighting crews) being called for help from another location (implying that they primarily operate in that location)\n\nIn summary, the text indicates that the West's forest firefighting crews primarily operate in Idaho, Oregon, California, and Washington, while the Boise Interagency Fire Center is headquartered in Boise, Idaho and is directing the firefighting operations in those states."},
