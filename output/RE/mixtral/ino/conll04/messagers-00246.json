There are two separate statements here, one about Sirhan and another about Markman.\n3. In the first statement, Sirhan's action of killing Kennedy is linked to Kennedy's warm feelings toward Israel. This indicates that Sirhan is not from Israel, as his actions suggest a negative sentiment towards Israel.\n4. In the second statement, Markman mentions that he had come from Israel. This indicates that Markman is associated with Israel, either by nationality, residence, or affiliation.\n5. The pattern here is the mention of a location (Israel) in relation to an individual's actions or origins.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the given text, there are two distinct relationships established with the location of Israel. Firstly, Sirhan's actions are negatively related to Israel, and secondly, Markman is positively associated with Israel, as he had come from there."},
