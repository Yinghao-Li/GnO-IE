The National Governors' Association is a bipartisan organization that represents governors from all 50 states and territories of the United States.\n5. The fact that Terry Branstad is the governor of Iowa and Booth Gardner is the governor of Washington suggests a relationship between the organization (National Governors' Association) and the locations (Iowa and Washington) where these individuals hold office.\n6. The organization does not have a specific headquarters mentioned in the text, but it is made up of governors from different states, indicating that the organization operates in all of the states where the governors are based.\n7.
