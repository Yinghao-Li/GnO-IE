    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The given text is about the Greenland Expedition Society searching for the \"lost squadron\" in Greenland. The \"lost squadron\" refers to eight aircraft that crash landed in Greenland in 1942. The text mentions the location where the expedition took place and the year of the incident, but it does not explicitly state where the Greenland Expedition Society is headquartered or primarily operates.\n\nHowever, the name of the organization itself suggests that it is primarily focused on expeditions related to Greenland. The fact that the society is called the \"Greenland Expedition Society\" implies that Greenland is a significant location for the organization. Therefore, we can infer that the Greenland Expedition Society is headquartered or primarily operates in a location related to Greenland.\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that the society's members, including Pat Epps, suffered from hunger, cold, and sunburn during their expedition in Greenland. This further supports the idea that the society is actively involved in expeditions in Greenland and is likely headquartered or primarily operates in a location that allows for easy access to Greenland.\n\nIn summary, while the text does not explicitly state where the Greenland Expedition Society is headquartered or primarily operates, the name of the organization and the details of the expedition suggest that it is closely associated with Greenland. Therefore, we can infer that the Greenland Expedition Society is headquartered or primarily operates in a location related to Greenland."},
