Draw conclusions: In this paragraph, Hatcher initially fled to the Onondaga territory, which means the Onondaga territory is a location where Hatcher was present at some point. However, the text also states that Hatcher has since moved to a Shoshone-Bannock reservation in Idaho. This does not necessarily imply that the Shoshone-Bannock reservation is located within the Onondaga territory, as Hatcher could have moved out of the Onondaga territory and then moved to the Shoshone-Bannock reservation.\n\nConclusion: While Hatcher was present in the Onondaga territory at one point, the text does not explicitly state that the Onondaga territory is located within or contains any other location."},
