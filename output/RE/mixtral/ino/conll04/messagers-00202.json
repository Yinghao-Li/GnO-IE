The court's verdict applies to Kurds who have no safe haven in Turkey. This suggests that the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin is making a decision that will impact the way Germany handles asylum claims from Kurds who are currently in Turkey.\n\nPattern: The pattern that emerges from this text is the relationship between an organization (the Federal Administrative Court) and a location (Berlin, Germany). The court is making a decision that will impact individuals (Kurds) who are seeking asylum in Germany but have no safe haven in another country (Turkey). This pattern suggests that organizations can be headquartered or primarily operate in specific locations, and that their decisions can have implications for individuals or groups in other countries."},
