In this case, the text specifically mentions that Eastport International is based in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.\n3. While the text does not explicitly state that Eastport International primarily operates in Maryland, the fact that they are headquartered there and are involved in recovering wreckage from the Challenger space shuttle disaster, which occurred off the coast of Florida, suggests that they have a wide operational range.\n4. However, the focus of the text is on the recovery of the recorder from a specific location (a depth of 14,800 feet), rather than on the location of Eastport International's headquarters or primary operations.\n\nIn summary, the text indicates that Eastport International is headquartered in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether the organization primarily operates in that location."},
