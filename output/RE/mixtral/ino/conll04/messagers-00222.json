The text does not provide any explicit information about the location where the organization (in this case, the prison where Sirhan Sirhan is serving his sentence) is headquartered or primarily operates.\n\nHowever, we can infer that Sirhan Sirhan is being held in a prison located in a place that has the authority to grant parole to him. In the United States, this authority typically lies with the state government where the prison is located. Therefore, we can infer that the prison where Sirhan Sirhan is serving his sentence is located in a state that has denied him parole for the 10th time.\n\nWithout additional information, we cannot identify the specific location of the prison or the organization responsible for holding and making decisions about Sirhan Sirhan's parole. However, the pattern we can identify is that the organization responsible for his incarceration and parole decisions is located in the same state where the prison is located."},
