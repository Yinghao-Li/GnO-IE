The text mentions that Lennon and his wife were returning to their \"apartment in New York's Dakota building.\" This indicates that Lennon lived in a specific location, namely an apartment in the Dakota building in New York.\n2. The Dakota building is located in New York City, which is a specific location and a well-known city in the United States.\n3. The fact that Lennon lived in the Dakota building in New York City suggests that he had a significant connection to that location. It is possible that he spent a significant amount of time there, and that it was his primary residence.\n4. The text also mentions that Lennon was returning from a \"recording session,\" but it does not specify the location of the recording session. Therefore, we cannot determine if the recording session took place in New York or another location.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can identify a relationship between the organization (in this case, Lennon) and a specific location (New York City, and more specifically, the Dakota building). This relationship is indicated by the fact that Lennon lived in the Dakota building, which suggests that he had a significant connection to that location. However, we do not have enough information to determine if the recording session took place in New York or another location, so we cannot make any conclusions about the relationship between the recording session and a specific location."},
