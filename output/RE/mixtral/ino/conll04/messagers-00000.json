The fact that the Hakawati Theatre is located in \"Arab east Jerusalem\" provides additional information about the location of the theater. Therefore, we can infer that there is a relationship between the Hakawati Theatre (an organization) and the location \"Arab east Jerusalem.\"\n\nThe art exhibit itself is described as a \"series of portraits of Palestinians killed in the rebellion.\" This suggests that the exhibit is focused on a particular group of people, namely Palestinians who were killed in a rebellion. While this does not directly indicate a relationship between an organization and a location, it does provide context for the location of the art exhibit and the people who are being depicted in the exhibit.\n\nOverall, the pattern that we can identify in this text is the relationship between an organization (the Hakawati Theatre) and a specific location (Arab east Jerusalem). This relationship is established through the mention of the art exhibit taking place at the theater and the location of the theater in Arab east Jerusalem."},
