The Okhotsk Sea is located in the central part of the Okhotsk Sea, which is specifically mentioned in the text.\n3. The text then mentions an agreement signed in Washington regarding the regulation of fishing in the central part of the Bering Sea.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the Magadan Basin Okhotrybvod Department, which is headquartered in the location associated with the Okhotsk Sea, is likely primarily concerned with fishing regulation and operations in that specific location. Additionally, the mention of the Washington agreement suggests that international cooperation and regulation may also be a factor in the department's operations. However, the text does not provide enough information to definitively state that the department primarily operates in the Okhotsk Sea or that it is headquartered there."},
