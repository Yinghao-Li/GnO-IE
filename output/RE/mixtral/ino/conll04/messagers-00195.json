The fact that the agreement is being signed at the EU headquarters further supports this relationship, as it suggests that this is the main location where such agreements are negotiated and signed.\n3. The individuals involved in the agreement are also relevant to the relationship. Ortega is likely representing a separate organization, while Rene Steichen is identified as a \"European agricultural official,\" indicating his affiliation with the EU.\n4. The language used to describe the agreement as \"more normal\" also implies a longstanding relationship between the EU and another organization or entity, further reinforcing the idea that the EU is a well-established organization with a significant presence in Brussels.\n\nIn summary, the text suggests that the European Union is headquartered or primarily operates in Brussels, as evidenced by the mention of the EU headquarters and the involvement of EU officials in the agreement."},
