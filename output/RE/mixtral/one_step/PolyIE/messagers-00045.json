Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 14 In particular , Guo et al. reported that OFETs based on a phthalimide - containing polythiophene exhibited hole mobilities of ∼ 0.2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 under ambient conditions without optimization. 14 Thiophene imide has simple , compact , symmetric , and planar structure. It could promote intrachain and interchain interactions along and between coplanar polymer chains. Zhang et al. pioneered to use thiophene imide as a building block in conjugated polymers. 15,16 Later , thiophene imide homopolymers were synthesized. 17-19 Recently , polymer solar cells based on blends of copolymers of thiophene imide and benzodithiophene 20-23 or cyclopentadithiophene 24 with soluble fullerene derivatives PC71BM or PC61BM exhibited PCEs of 3-6.8 % . Wudl et al. reported low - bandgap conjugated polymers based on thiophene - fused phthalimide , i.e. , isothianaphthene imides ( 5 , Figure 1 ). 25,26 2,2 0 -Bithiophene-3,3 0 -dicarboximide ( BTI , 6 , Figure 1 ) with π-core planarity , antiparallel BTI packing , a short cofacial π-π distance of 3.43 Å , and a favorable solubilizing group orientation is a promising building block in n - type polymers. 27 Facchetti et al. reported that n-channel OFET based on a bithiophene imide homopolymer exhibited a μ e of 1.1 x 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , I on / I off of 2 x 10^7 , and a high V th ( 75 V ) in vacuum after annealing process at 240 ° C. 27 The fused - ring system can maximize the π-orbital overlap by restricting intramolecular rotation in the oligomer and possibly to induce face - to - face π-stacking , facilitating charge transport through intermolecular hopping. On the other hand , the fused rings can make the polymer backbone more rigid and coplanar , therefore enhancing effective π-conjugation , lowering bandgap , and extending absorption. 28-31 Therefore , fused - ring building blocks are widely used in synthesis of conjugated polymers. 32-34 For example , the large planar benzodithiophene ( BDT ) unit has emerged as an attractive building block for conjugated polymers. 35 Benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene ( 7 , Figure 2 ) with a curved structure prevents a fully conjugated pathway between substituents at the 2-and 6-positions. Hence , delocalization of the conjugated π-electron system along the copolymer backbone is disfavored by the incorporation of this unit. This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation. Additionally , compared to a single thiophene ring , it must be pointed out that due to the large resonance stabilization energy of BDT , the delocalization of electrons from the BDT unit into the backbone is less favorable than from the thiophene ring. As a result , a more stable copolymer with high performance can be obtained by using BDT as the core unit. OFETs based on a benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene copolymer manufactured on flexible substrate exhibited high hole mobility of 0.5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 when the source-gate voltage is increased to 60 V.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
