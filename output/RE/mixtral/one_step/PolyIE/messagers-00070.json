Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: The decent hole mobilities of both copolymers can be attributed to high crystallinity of the copolymers due to the highly coplanar structure of anthracene and DPP. It is also understood that the 3-fold higher chargecarrier mobility of PTATDPP than that of PTAFDPP arises from its stronger π-π stacking with a shorter d 010 , as discussed above. When the photovoltaic properties of copolymers are measured using PC71BM as an electron acceptor , it is found that the optimum blend ratio of polymer : PC71BM is 1 : 2 to afford the best PCE of both copolymers with the conventional device architecture of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al ( Fig. S2 and Table S1 † ). The best PCE was also achieved when o-dichlorobenzene was used as a solvent and the optimum thickness for the active layer was ca. 90 nm. The current density - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the optimized solar cells are shown in Fig. 4 , and the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Tables 2 and S2. † PTATDPP showed a best PCE of 6.69% ( V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 12.3 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.68 ) , while PTAFDPP showed a best PCE of 5.02% ( V OC = 0.76 V , J SC = 11.2 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.59 ). Both copolymers showed higher V OC s than other DPP - based copolymers due to their low - lying HOMO energy levels. Both copolymers also exhibited high J SC s and FFs , indicating their decent ability for charge generation and transport. Therefore , the TA unit is a promising electron - donating unit for low band - gap copolymers with a low - lying HOMO energy level. When the PSC devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture ( ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag ) in order to further improve the photovoltaic performance , the PCEs of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP - based devices were improved to 7.02% and 5.22% , respectively ( Fig. 4b , Tables 2 and S2 † ) , mainly due to enhanced J SC s ( V OC s and FFs were not changed significantly ). It is noteworthy here that the PCE of over 7% of PTATDPP is the highest efficiency of anthracene - based low band - gap conjugated copolymers. In spite of the same band - gap of the two copolymers , PTATDPP shows slightly higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP ( Fig. S3 † ). This can be ascribed to the closely packed microstructures of PTATDPP and thereby its high charge - carrier mobility than PTAFDPP. When the crystal structures of blend films of the copolymers with PC71BM were examined by XRD , the PTATDPP / PC71BM blend had strong and intense ( 100 ) diffraction while the PTAFDPP / PC71BM blend showed weak and broad ( 100 ) diffraction ( Fig. 2b ).\n\nLet's think step by step."},
