PSFDTBT has an optical band gap of 1.97 eV with the low - lying HOMO energy level at -5.4 eV. The hole mobility of the pristine PSFDTBT film spin - cast from o-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) solution is 7.26 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10^5 . Polymer solar cell devices based on the blend films of PSFDTBT and PC71BM show a high open - circuit voltage of 0.94 V and a power conversion efficiency of 4.6% without any post-treatment. All the device measurements were performed in air without encapsulation. This is the first report on spirobifluorene - based conjugated polymers used for polymer solar cells , demonstrating the great potential of spirobifluorene moiety as an electron - donating unit for the construction of main chain donor - acceptor alternating conjugated polymers for high performance polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , as the most promising sustainable energy source alternative to inorganic - based solar cells , have received intensive attention in both academia and industry in recent years. 1 In comparison with inorganic solar cells , PSCs have the potential advantages of lightweight , flexibility , and manufacturing by low cost roll - to - roll process. 2 Up to date , bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure , in which the active layer consists of an interpenetrating blend of electron donating conjugated polymers and electron accepting fullerene derivatives , is still the most useful active layer structure for high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) polymer solar cells. 1,3 Intensive researches worldwide on polymer design and device fabrication have led to a rapid development in the field of PSCs. 1,4 Recently , power conversion efficiency higher than 7% for BHJ polymer solar cells has been achieved by several groups through the developing of new polymer donor materials with the use of [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or [6,6]phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as electron acceptors. 4a-i For the designing high power conversion efficiency donor polymers , the following three points should be considered : 5 ( 1 ) the polymer should have appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels for harvesting as more photons as possible from solar radiation ; 5b ( 2 ) the polymer / PCBM blend films should have high and balanced carrier mobility for generating more free charge carriers and efficiently collecting them at corresponding electrodes ; 6 ( 3 ) the polymer should be soluble in common organic solvent for solution processing. 7 Main chain donor - acceptor alternating design is a very efficient way to engineer the band gap of conjugated polymers through the internal charge transfer from donor to acceptor unit.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
