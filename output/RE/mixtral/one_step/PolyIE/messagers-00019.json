Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: The ratios between the hole and electron mobilities were calculated to be 3.2 and 13.6 for the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend and the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend films , respectively. The less balanced carrier transport in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film accounts for the lower FF. The polymers and polymer blend films were also analyzed by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) studies. Figure 8 shows the XRD patterns of the polymers and the polymer : PC 70 BM blends. All film XRD results were similar and showed weak crystalline features with a broad peak around 23 ° . The crystalline features corresponding to π-stacking among the conjugated polymer backbones were also observed among TT - based polymers ; 25 however , the peaks were broader , and no crystalline peaks were observed at smaller angles around 4.4 ° . This less crystalline feature was possibly caused by the more twisted polymer backbones , as compared to PTB7 or PBDTTPD polymer backbones . In conclusion , we synthesized the low band gap POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers that consist of dialkoxybenzodithiophene ( BDT ) as the donor and N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5azacyclopenta[a]pentalene-4,6-dione ( DTPD ) as the acceptor. The DTPD acceptor moieties allow the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers to have a low band gap ( ∼ 900 nm ) and optimal HOMO and LUMO levels alignment for PSCs , yielding the PCEs of 4.7 and 5.3% , respectively. In this study , we demonstrate , for the first time , that the DTPD unit is a promising electron - withdrawing building block for low band gap polymers , and it can be utilized to tailor the optical and electronic properties of conjugated polymers for photovoltaic devices and many other applications in plastic electronics.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
