Without any device optimization , the device afforded an open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.50 V , a short - circuit current density ( J sc ) of 1.42 mA / cm^2 , a fill factor ( FF ) of 42.4% , and a preliminary power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 0.30% under an AM 1.5 simulated solar light at 100 mW / cm^2 ( Figure 7 ). The PCE is lower than that of poly[thiopheneimide-alt-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene ] , 20-22 probably due to low hole mobility of P1 ( ca. 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). ( LUMO ≈ -3.8 eV ) , 4 dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 - h ] We have designed and synthesized a new fused - ring building block , dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide. On the basis of this new building block , we have designed and synthesized a series of new conjugated copolymers containing electron - rich unit benzodithiophene or electron - deficient unit bithiazole or benzothiadiazole and homopolymers. The optical properties and HOMO / LUMO levels can be manipulated through adjusting copolymerized building blocks. Compared to homopolymer P6 , all copolymers P1-P5 exhibit red - shifted absorption and emission spectra in solution and in film and smaller bandgaps. Dithieno-[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide and its homopolymer exhibit low HOMO of -6.2 eV and relatively low LUMO of -3.1 eV , indicating that it is relatively weak n - type building block. Increase in electron - donating strength of the counit leads to upshift in both HOMO and LUMO , while increase in electron - withdrawing strength of the counit leads to downshift in both HOMO and LUMO. Preliminary OPV results show that polymer solar cells based on P1 : PC61BM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) gave a PCE of 0.30% under an AM 1.5 simulated solar light at 100 mW / cm^2. ' THF and toluene were distilled from sodium benzophenone under nitrogen prior to use. 3,4-Dibromofuran-2,5-dione ( 1 ) was synthesized according to the literature method. 41 4,8-Didodecyloxybenzodithiophene-2,6ditin and 4,4 0 -dihexyl-2,2 0 -bithiazole-5,5 0 -ditin were synthesized according to our published procedures. 47 Characterization. The 1 H and 13 °C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer. Mass spectra were measured on a GCT-MS micromass spectrometer using EI mode or on a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MALDI - TOF Analyzer using MALDI mode. Elemental analyses were carried out using a FLASH EA1112 elemental analyzer. Solution ( chloroform ) and thin - film ( on quartz substrate ) UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. Solution ( CHCl 3 ) and thin - film ( on quartz substrate ) emission spectra were collected on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorophotometer.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
