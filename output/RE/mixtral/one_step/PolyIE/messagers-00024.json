Linear plot of I ds 1 / 2 vs V gs deduced from the I ds vs V gs measurement. These devices show characteristics of a typical p-channel transistor with good drain - current Modulation , well - defined linear , and saturation regions ( Figure 2 ). The summary of the performances is provided in Table 1. I ds = ( W / 2L ) × μ × C i ( V gs - V th ) The OFET device using as-cast PCDTBT films without thermal annealing exhibits a hole mobility of 2.2 × 10^-4 cm^2 / V°s with an on / off current ratio ( I on / I off ) of 4.44 × 10^3 . For PCDTBT thin films after annealing at evaluated temperatures , the mobilities are not markedly improved , implying that the PCDTBT thin films remain nearly amorphous for both as-cast and annealing at high temperature. On the other hand , it is found that the unannealed thin films of PCDSeBT exhibit a slightly higher mobility of μ h = 5.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 / V°s , compared with that of pristine PCDTBT. Interestingly , in contrast , as the PCDSeBT thin films are annealed at a temperature of 120 and 150 °C , the mobilities are systematically improved up to 1.0 × 10^-3 cm^2 / V°s ( Figure 2b ) , which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of PCDTBT , possibly due to increased interpolymer chain contact induced by Se°°°Se interactions with the thermal annealing process. To gain a better understanding of the influence of the thermal annealing , the crystallinity and molecular organization of PCDTBT and PCDSeBT thin films were investigated by Xray diffraction ( XRD ) , both before and after annealing at 150 °C . Both the as-cast and annealed PCDTBT thin films fail to reveal any defined scattering patterns ( Figure 3a ) , indicating the macroscopically disordered , amorphous structure. In the case of PCDSeBT , the as-cast thin films show very weak diffractions ( Figure 3b ). Upon thermal annealing , the primary peak at 4.42 ° , corresponding to a d-spacing of 19.99 Å , progressively intensifies and the secondary broad peak at ∼ 21.1 ° ( d = 4.21 Å ) that is probably related to π-π stacking becomes visible ( Figure 3b ). On the basis of these XRD results , we can conclude that the oriented microstructure of the as-cast PCDSeBT thin films is kinetically limited but the polymer chains reorganize to ordered lamellar packing structures upon annealing. This observation is a plausible explanation for the sudden rise in mobility of PCDSeBT as a function of the thermal annealing.\n\nLet's think step by step."},

The OFET mobility is calculated in the saturation regime using the given equation, and the on/off current ratio is also provided. The hole mobility of the PCDTBT thin films does not significantly improve after annealing, while the PCDSeBT thin films exhibit a higher mobility after annealing at 120 and 150 °C. The crystallinity and molecular organization of the thin films are also investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), which reveals that the PCDTBT thin films are macroscopically disordered and amorphous, while the PCDSeBT thin films show weak diffractions that progressively intensify upon annealing, indicating the formation of ordered lamellar packing structures."}
