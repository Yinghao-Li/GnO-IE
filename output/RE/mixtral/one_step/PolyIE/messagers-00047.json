The redox behavior for P1-P6 and small molecule 4b were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( Figure 6 ). The monomer 4b shows a reversible reduction wave and an irreversible oxidation wave. The HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials , assuming the absolute energy level of ferrocene / ferrocenium to be 4.8 eV below vacuum , and the data are summarized in Table 2. The LUMO of 4b is -3.12 eV , which is similar to that ( ca. -3.23 eV ) of n - type building block BTI ( 6 , Figure 1 ). 27 As it is generally assumed that a high electron affinity ( > 3 eV ) is necessary for n - type materials , 4,45,46 we suggest that dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide functions as a n - type building block. However , compared to the very strong n - type building blocks PDI ( 1 , Figure 1 ) and NDI ( 2 , Figure 1 ) the imide moiety indeed significantly lowers the HOMO / LUMO. However , the LUMO of P6 is higher than that of BTI homopolymer ( -3.47 eV ). 27 Copolymers P1-P5 exhibit an irreversible reduction peak and an irreversible oxidation peak. The HOMO / LUMO of P1 is -5.55 / -2.78 eV ; the electron - rich unit benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene leads to upshifting of HOMO / LUMO levels compared to homopolymer P6. The LUMO of P1 is higher than that of poly[thiopheneimide-alt-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene ] ( -3.6 eV ) , 20 indicating that the electron - withdrawing ability of dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide is weaker than that of thiophene imide ( 4 , Figure 1 ) . As a result of two more electrondonating thiophenes in the polymer backbone , the HOMO of P2 increases by 0.22 eV relative to that of P1. P3 and P4 with weak electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole exhibit similar HOMO / LUMO levels to homopolymer P6 , while the stronger electronaccepting unit benzo [c][1,2,5]thiadiazole reduced the LUMO by 0.28 eV. The HOMO-LUMO gaps E g cv , estimated from electrochemistry , are larger than the optical bandgaps E g opt , very similar to that for BTI homopolymer and copolymer. 27 Photovoltaic Cells. To demonstrate potential application of dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide - based polymers in organic photovoltaics ( OPV ) , we chose P1 as an example to fabricate polymer solar cell devices because it possesses relatively broad absorption , proper HOMO / LUMO energy levels , and good solubility.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
