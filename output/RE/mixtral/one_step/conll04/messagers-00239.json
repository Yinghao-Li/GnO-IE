However, the paragraph itself does not explicitly state that either person has lived in a specific location.\n* While John Lennon is closely associated with the city of Liverpool, England, as it is the birthplace of the Beatles, the paragraph does not provide enough information to confirm that he resided there at the time of his death.\n* Similarly, Mark David Chapman's place of residence is not mentioned in the paragraph.\n\nTherefore, I cannot generate the requested Markdown table."}
