The paragraph mentions \"Atwater\" who \"earlier served as an aide to President Reagan.\" This implies that Atwater was employed by or associated with President Reagan's staff.\n2. The term \"aide\" generally refers to a person who assists in someone's work, in this case, President Reagan's work.\n3. The phrase \"worked for\" indicates a past employment relationship between Atwater and President Reagan's staff.\n\nNote: The table shows \"Works for/Worked for\" as the relationship status because the paragraph mentions that Atwater \"earlier served\" as an aide, implying that Atwater had a past employment relationship with President Reagan's staff. However, the exact time frame of this relationship is not specified in the paragraph."}
