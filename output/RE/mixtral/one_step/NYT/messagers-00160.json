Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that there are people with Syrian and Iraqi nationalities in the paragraph.\n\nHere's the Markdown table with the extracted nationalities:\n\n| Person | Nationality | Whether the Person has the Nationality |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Syrian leaders (Alawites) | Syrian | Yes |\n| Some Iraqis and Syrians (Sunnis) | Iraqi, Syrian | Yes |\n| Iran | Iranian | N/A |"}
