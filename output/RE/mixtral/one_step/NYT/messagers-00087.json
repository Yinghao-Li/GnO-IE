Therefore, we can infer that the officials are from the United States.\n* Europe: Similar to the United States, officials in Europe also issued warnings. Thus, we can assume that these officials are from various European countries.\n\nHere's the Markdown table with the extracted information:\n\n| Person          | Nationality | Whether the Person has the Nationality |\n|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Officials      | United States| Yes                                  |\n| Officials      | Europe      | Yes                                  |\n\nNote that the table includes plural nouns (officials) because the paragraph does not specify individual names."}
