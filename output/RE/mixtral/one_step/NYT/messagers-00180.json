The paragraph states that he died in Paris, France, but it does not explicitly mention his nationality. However, his name, \"Randy M. Punak,\" suggests that he might be of American nationality, given the \"M.\" initial and the mention of his location as \"NYC\" (New York City). Therefore, I will make an educated guess that Randy M. Punak is of American nationality.\n\nHere's the Markdown table with the extracted information:\n\n| Person          | Nationality | Whether the Person has the Nationality |\n|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Randy M.

On the other hand, \"Paris, France\" refers to a specific city located in the country of France. Therefore, \"France\" is a broader location that encompasses \"Paris,\" and \"Paris\" is a more specific location within \"France.\"\n\nHowever, the paragraph does not mention the country \"France\" in a broader sense, but rather as a specific location where the person died.
