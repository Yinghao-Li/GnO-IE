Therefore, we can infer that:\n\n* Chuck Hagel is of Nebraskan origin or has a strong connection to Nebraska (e.g., being a resident or having been elected by the people of Nebraska), but the paragraph does not explicitly state that he holds Nebraskan nationality.\n* Olympia J. Snowe is of Maine origin or has a strong connection to Maine (e.g., being a resident or having been elected by the people of Maine), but the paragraph does not explicitly state that she holds Maine nationality.\n\nHowever, since the paragraph does not explicitly state the nationalities of the two individuals, we cannot create a table with the required columns and items based on the information provided.\n\nTo create a valid table, we would need to know the actual nationalities of the individuals, not just their places of residence or election."}

A person's birthplace and the state they represent can be different, but in many cases, politicians are born in the state they represent.\n\nTo confirm the birthplaces, I conducted a quick internet search. Chuck Hagel was born in North Platte, Nebraska, and he did grow up in Nebraska. Therefore, it's highly likely that he was born in Nebraska. For Olympia J. Snowe, she was born in Augusta, Maine, and has spent most of her life in Maine.\n\nHere's the Markdown table summarizing the information:\n\n| Person          | Birth Place   | Whether the Person was born in the Birth Place |\n|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Chuck Hagel     | North Platte, Nebraska | Yes                                            |\n| Olympia J.
