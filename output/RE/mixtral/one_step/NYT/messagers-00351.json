This likely refers to the government or officials in Washington D.C., the capital city of the United States.\n2. The second location mentioned is \"Moscow\", which is the capital city of Russia.\n3. The relationship between these two locations is that Washington (in this context, the U.S. government or officials) and Moscow (the Russian government or officials) have growing tensions.\n4. However, the paragraph also mentions that there are still areas in which the two powers can cooperate, with a specific example of Russian support on the situation with Iran. This implies that the U.S. and Russia are two broader geographical locations that encompass their respective governments or officials.\n5. Therefore, the hierarchical relationship between the two locations is as follows:\n\n| Broader Location | Specific Location | Whether the Broader Location contains the Specific Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| United States | Washington | Yes |\n| Russia | Moscow | Yes |\n\nIn this case, both \"United States\" and \"Russia\" are broader locations that encompass their respective capital cities, \"Washington\" and \"Moscow\"."}
