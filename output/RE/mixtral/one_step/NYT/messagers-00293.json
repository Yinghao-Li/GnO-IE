The two locations are \"Ontario in Canada\" and \"San Antonio.\"\n\nNext, we need to determine the hierarchical relationship between these two locations. \"Ontario in Canada\" is a broader location than \"San Antonio\" because Ontario is a province in Canada, while San Antonio is a city in the United States.\n\nTherefore, the valid relationship is:\n\n| Broader Location | Specific Location | Whether the Broader Location contains the Specific Location |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ontario in Canada | San Antonio | No |\n\nHowever, the paragraph also mentions that Toyota has a plant in San Antonio, which implies that San Antonio is a location where Toyota has a facility. Therefore, we can also say that:\n\n| Broader Location | Specific Location | Whether the Broader Location contains the Specific Location |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Toyota's facilities | San Antonio | Yes |\n\nBut this relationship is not directly stated in the paragraph and requires additional context.
