    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paragraph mentions two broader geographical locations, France and Germany, which each have 35 percent of the workload for the A350 XWB. The A350 XWB is a specific type of wide-body jet, so France and Germany are both broader locations that encompass the work being done on the A350 XWB.\n\nThe paragraph also mentions Britain and Spain, which have 20 percent and 10 percent of the workload, respectively. Since Britain and Spain are also mentioned as separate from France and Germany, we can infer that they are more specific locations that are encompassed within the broader locations of France and Germany.\n\nTherefore, the valid relationships between the geographical locations mentioned in the paragraph are as follows:\n\n| Broader Location | Specific Location | Whether the Broader Location contains the Specific Location |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| France | A350 XWB | Yes |\n| Germany | A350 XWB | Yes |\n| France | Britain | Yes |\n| Germany | Britain | Yes |\n| France | Spain | Yes |\n| Germany | Spain | Yes |\n\nNote that the A350 XWB is a specific location in the sense that it is a particular type of wide-body jet, but it is not a geographical location.
