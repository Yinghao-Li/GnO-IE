Therefore, we cannot definitively say that there is a \"Person A is a child of Person B\" relationship in this paragraph.\n\nIf we assume that Atiku Abubakar is a child of Olusegun Obasanjo in the context of being his vice president, then the table would look like this:\n\n| Parent | Child | Whether the Parent has the Child |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Olusegun Obasanjo | Atiku Abubakar | Vice President |\n\nNote that the \"Whether the Parent has the Child\" column is filled with \"Vice President\" instead of \"Yes\" or \"No\" because the relationship is not a simple parent-child relationship, but rather a political one."}
