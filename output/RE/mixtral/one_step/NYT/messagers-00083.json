Smith is associated with Oregon, while Senator Norm Coleman is associated with Minnesota.\n3. In the context of this paragraph, there is no hierarchical relationship suggested between Oregon and Minnesota; they are both treated as equal entities.

As a result, no table can be created to represent a hierarchical relationship between these two locations."}
