Both the West Bank and Gaza are part of the Palestinian territories, but the West Bank is not part of the Gaza Strip, and vice versa.\n4. However, during the 40-year occupation, Israel had control over these territories, making them a single geopolitical entity under Israeli administration.\n5. Therefore, the broader location that encompasses both the West Bank and Gaza in this context is the \"West Bank and Gaza\" as a single entity under Israeli occupation.\n\nHere's the valid relationship as a Markdown table:\n\n| Broader Location                 | Specific Location          | Whether the Broader Location contains the Specific Location |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| The West Bank and Gaza (under Israeli occupation) | The West Bank   | Yes                                                     |\n| The West Bank and Gaza (under Israeli occupation) | Gaza           | Yes                                                     |"}
