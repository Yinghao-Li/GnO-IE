Next, we need to determine the relationships between these persons. From the paragraph, there is no direct relationship stated between these persons. However, the fact that Ehud Olmert is identified as \"the prime minister of Israel\" implies that he is a political leader of the country of Israel. Similarly, Mahmoud Abbas is identified as \"the Palestinian president\", implying that he is a political leader of the Palestinian territories.\n3. Based on this information, we can infer that Ehud Olmert is not a child of Mahmoud Abbas, and vice versa. However, it is possible that one of them is a child of the other in a broader sense, such as being a descendant or a relative.\n4. Without further information, we cannot definitively say whether Ehud Olmert or Mahmoud Abbas is a child of the other. Therefore, we cannot create a table of relationships based on the information provided in the paragraph."}
