The West Bank is not mentioned as being part of Gaza or contained within Gaza, but Gaza is mentioned as being lost \"to extremism\" with last week's takeover of \"the territory.\" This implies that Gaza is a specific location within a broader territory.\n3. The broader territory is not explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests that it is the Palestinian territories or the future Palestinian state.\n4. Therefore, the hierarchical relationship between the two locations is as follows:\n\n| Broader Location | Specific Location | Whether the Broader Location contains the Specific Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| Palestinian territories/future Palestinian state | Gaza | Yes |\n| The West Bank | The West Bank | N/A (it is the same location) |\n\nNote: The paragraph does not provide enough information to determine the exact hierarchical relationship between the Palestinian territories/future Palestinian state and the West Bank.
