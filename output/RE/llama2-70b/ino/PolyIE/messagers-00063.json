The energy levels , absorption spectra and band gaps of the resulting polymers were well tuned by utilizing different thiophene derivatives as spacer between IDT and NT units , and polymer PIDT-C12NT which employed bithiophene attached with dodecyl side chain as spacer exhibited superior properties compared to the other two copolymers. All polymers exhibited deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and subsequently lead to high open circuit voltages of fabricated solar cell devices. Best performance of the bulk - heterojunction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 5.05% was achieved with PIDT-C12NT as donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor , which can be attributed to its higher charge carrier mobility , the optimized interpenetrating network as well as enhanced absorption coefficient of photoactive layer with respect to the other two polymers. The results demonstrated that the combination of IDT and NT with appropriate spacers was a promising molecular design strategy for the application of solar cells . During the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted extensive attention due to their lightweight , low cost and great potential for the fabrication of large - area flexible devices. 1-3 PSCs based on bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) architecture are of particular interests since high performance devices with power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) exceed 8% can be achieved. 4-9 Typical BHJ devices comprise a phaseseparated donor / acceptor blend layer with low band gap conjugated polymers as the electron donor , and fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as the electron acceptor. 10,11 Generally , when considering that open circuit voltage ( V oc ) is related to the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level of donor materials and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of acceptor , 12,13 deep HOMO levels for low band gap conjugated polymers are preferred in order to attain high V oc . However , lowering HOMO level would result in larger band gap , and thereby the absorption of resulted polymers would have less overlap with solar spectrum , which are unfavorable for high short circuit current ( J sc ). To obtain the ideal low band gap polymer with appropriate energy levels that can make a tradeoff between open circuit voltage ( V oc ) and band gap so as to maximize the PCE , an intriguing approach involves incorporat - ing electron rich moieties ( donor , D ) and electron deficient moieties ( acceptor , A ) and alternating them on the backbone , which are so - called D-A type low band gap conjugated polymers.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paragraph describes the synthesis and properties of three donor-acceptor type narrow band gap conjugated polymers, PIDT-C12NT, PIDT-C8NT, and PIDT-C4NT, synthesized via Stille copolymerization of indacenodithiophene (IDT) and naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) (NT) based monomers. The polymers were designed to have enlarged coplanar skeleton and tunable energy levels, absorption spectra, and band gaps by utilizing different thiophene derivatives as spacers between IDT and NT units.\n\nThe properties of the resulting polymers are summarized as follows:\n\n1. PIDT-C12NT:\n* HOMO energy level: deep (not specified)\n* LUMO energy level: not specified\n* Band gap: not specified\n* Absorption spectrum: not specified\n* Charge carrier mobility: high\n* Interpenetrating network: optimized\n* Photoactive layer absorption coefficient: enhanced\n* Solar cell performance: best, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.05%\n2. PIDT-C8NT:\n* HOMO energy level: not specified\n* LUMO energy level: not specified\n* Band gap: not specified\n* Absorption spectrum: not specified\n* Charge carrier mobility: lower than PIDT-C12NT\n* Interpenetrating network: less optimized than PIDT-C12NT\n* Photoactive layer absorption coefficient: lower than PIDT-C12NT\n* Solar cell performance: lower than PIDT-C12NT\n3. PIDT-C4NT:\n* HOMO energy level: not specified\n* LUMO energy level: not specified\n* Band gap: not specified\n* Absorption spectrum: not specified\n* Charge carrier mobility: lower than PIDT-C12NT\n* Interpenetrating network: less optimized than PIDT-C12NT\n* Photoactive layer absorption coefficient: lower than PIDT-C12NT\n* Solar cell performance: lower than PIDT-C12NT\n\nThe paragraph also provides general information about polymer solar cells (PSCs) and their architecture, including the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) architecture, which is of particular interest due to its high performance and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 8%. The BHJ devices typically consist of a phase-separated donor/acceptor blend layer with low band gap conjugated polymers as the electron donor and fullerene derivatives as the electron acceptor. The open circuit voltage (Voc) of a solar cell is related to the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor material and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor, so deep HOMO levels are preferred to attain high Voc. However, lowering the HOMO level would result in a larger band gap, which would reduce the absorption of the resulted polymers and unfavorably affect the short circuit current (Jsc). Therefore, an intriguing approach to obtaining the ideal low band gap polymer with appropriate energy levels is to incorporate electron-rich moieties (donor, D) and electron-deficient moieties (acceptor, A) and alternate them on the backbone, which are known as D-A type low band gap conjugated polymers."},
