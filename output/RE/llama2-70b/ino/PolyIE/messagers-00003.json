Among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs fabricated , PffBB-14 with strongest aggregation strength / behavior exhibited the most promising photovoltaic performance , with a maximum PCE of 9.93% , a large V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36% . Such a superior device efficiency was attributed to the greatly enhanced exciton dissociation , higher and balanced charge carrier mobilities , and less recombination losses in the active layer of the PffBB-14:PC71BM - based cells. Our results demonstrated that the modulation of aggregation behavior through structural modification and temperature tuning could effectively optimize the physical and optoelectronic properties of a material and device for solar cell applications . Synthesis and Physical Properties of Polymers. The PffBB-n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16 ) polymers were synthesized according to the optimized literature procedures and the synthetic scheme is shown in Scheme 1.^39 The Corey - House synthesis of 3-bromothiophene and oxalyl dichloride gave 1,2di(thiophen-3-yl)ethane-1,2-dione ( 1 ) as a brown needle - like crystal in a good yield ( 70% ). Oxidative cyclization of 1 in the presence of iron(III) chloride carried out in diluted dichloromethane ( DCM ) solution yielded a dark purple benzodithiophene-4,5-diketone ( 2 ) crystal. Acetylation of 2 with Zn powder and acetic anhydride performed under basic conditions produced yellowish benzodithiophene-4,5-diyl diacetate ( 3 ) powder in a good yield of 85% . 3 was then alkylated with 2ethylhexyl bromide in the presence of Cs 2 CO 3 yielding 4,5bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzodithiophene ( 4 ) as a sticky colorless liquid. Proton abstraction of 4 by n-BuLi followed by the reaction with tri-butyltin chloride gave the polycondensation precursor , 4,5-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,7-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)benzodithiophene ( 5 ). To preserve high reactivity , the crude product was subjected to flash chromatography and kept under -20 °C for the condensation reaction. Alkylation of the thiophene ring was carried out by Kumada coupling , yielding 3-alkylthiophene as a colorless oil or a white solid ( 6-9 ). Lithiation of alkylated thiophene followed by quenching with tri-butyltin chloride afforded tri-butyl(4alkylthiophene-2-yl)stannane ( 10-13 ). Subsequent coupling with 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole afforded dithienyl-substituted difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole , 14-17. NBS bromination of 14-17 produced the acceptor units , 18-21 , respectively , which were carefully purified through chromatography and recrystallization to ensure high reactivity for the condensation reaction. The Stille polycondensation reaction of donor unit 5 and acceptor units 18-21 was carried out under the catalyst of Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 in chlorobenzene solutions at 150 °C for 3 days that could afford the corresponding polymers as a dark green solid. Gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) was used to determine the molecular weight using polystyrene as the standard and 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene as the eluent ( Table 1 ).\n\nLet's think step by step."},
