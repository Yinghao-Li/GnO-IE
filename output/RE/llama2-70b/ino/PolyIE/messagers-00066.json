As film morphology plays a critical role in charge transport , the smoother blend film based on PIDT-C12NT that present more favorable morphological features , may effectively reduce charge recombination and traps , and thereby potentially lead to higher J sc and fill factor ( FF ) than the other two polymers. Photovoltaic Properties. The photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers were investigated with a conventional device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 40 nm ) / polym e r : P C 7^1 B M ( 8^0 n m ) / p o l y [ ( 9 , 9 -b i s ( 3 â€² -( N , Ndimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene) ] ( PFN ) ( 5 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ) , here a thin layer of PFN was employed as the cathode interlayer since it can improve the electron extraction. 56-58 We chose PC71BM as the acceptor because it had much stronger absorption in the visible region than PC61BM , which can complement the absorption valley of the polymers and beneficial for high - efficiency PSCs. 59 The BHJ photoactive layer was prepared by spin - coating chlorobenzene solution of the polymer : PC71BM with weight ratio of 1 : 2 on the top of PEDOT : PSS layer without further treatment. The tests were performed under the illumination of AM 1.5G , 100 mW cm^-2 with an active of area of 0.16 cm^2. The J-V characteristics are shown in Figure 6a and the parameters of J sc , V oc , FF and PCE of the resulting PSCs are summarized in Table 2. It was found that all PSC devices based on these polymers demonstrated relative high V oc of ca. 0.8 - 0.9 V , which benefited from the deep HOMO levels. Device based on PIDT - EHNT obtained a low PCE of 1.49% , with a J sc of 4.33 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.86 V and a FF of 40% . Slightly improved device performance was realized based on PIDT - DTNT , which exhibited a V oc of 0.80 V , a FF of 45% , but a dramatically improved J sc of 8.26 mA cm^-2 , leading to a moderate PCE of 2.97% . Best device performance with a PCE of 5.05% was achieved based on PIDT-C12NT , which showed further improved J sc of 10.21 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.90 V and a FF of 55% .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
