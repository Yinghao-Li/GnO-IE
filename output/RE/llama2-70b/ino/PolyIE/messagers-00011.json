    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: 14,[32][33][34][35][36] In 2008 , we reported the synthesis of a copolymer between the DTP donor and the DTBT acceptor. 27 It has been proved that the thienyl ring can enhance the π-π stacking intermolecular interactions and lead to a high charge carrier mobility. 37 In addition , the ordered structure can enhance the carrier mobility ; thereby symmetric thienyl units along the polymer main chain are selected. In this regard , a simple and effective method might be to tune the properties of D-A type photovoltaic polymers by introducing thienyl groups as spacers between donor and acceptor segments in the backbone. In this study , three kinds of low band gap copolymers integrating DTP as the donor block and the most - used BT as the acceptor unit were synthesized. Different numbers of thienyl ( T ) as spacers were introduced along the copolymer main chain to investigate the effect on optical , electrochemical and photovoltaic performance. [6,6]-Phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) was used as an acceptor in the blended film of copolymers : PC 70 BM. Different solvents ( chlorobenzene ( CB ) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) ) were tested to build an optimized interpenetrated network in the active film , and the corresponding film properties and the photovoltaic device performance are discussed in detail . Fig. 1 shows the optical absorption spectra of PDTP-BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT in CHCl 3 solution and in thin films spin - coated on quartz plates. The absorption maximum wavelength in the solutions and the films and the optical band gap deduced from the absorption onsets are summarized in Table 1. Judging from the splitting of the absorption bands , it can be speculated that the polymers have the typical absorption characteristics of D-A type copolymers with π-π* and charge transfer - type transitions. Comparing the polymers PDTP-BT and PDTP-DT2BT with the previously synthesized polymer PDTP - DTBT , 27 the difference in their absorption is distinct. The PDTP - DTBT solution showed two prominent absorption maxima at 450 and 671 nm , while PDTP-BT and PDTP-DT2BT solutions demonstrated two main absorption maxima at 413 and 711 nm and at 480 and 603 nm , respectively. Although the absorption peaks in the Scheme 1 Synthetic route of three dithienopyrrole - based donor - acceptor type copolymers with thienyl spacers. long wavelength blue - shifted by 40 nm and 108 nm with insertion of one and two thienyl spacers to PDTP-BT , the absorption coefficients at the absorption maxima increase from 3.6 × 10^4 ( PDTP-BT ) to 4.0 × 10^4 ( PDTP - DTBT ) and 4.7 × 10^4 L mol^-1 cm^-1 ( PDTP-DT2BT ) , respectively. In thin films , the three copolymers exhibit similar shapes and red - shifted absorption spectra compared with those in the solutions , which indicates stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid state.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
