The lower bandgap with the broaden absorption band significantly improves a J SC of 11.7 mA / cm^2 , which is among the highest J SC values for PSCs based on PCDTBT derivatives , while the low HOMO energy level maintains the high V OC value. The corresponding PCE is 4.12% , about 37% higher than that obtained from a PCDTBT - based reference device. This work provides a feasible strategy for selective fine - tuning of LUMO levels , which achieves a high J SC value , while nearly remaining a high V OC . Therefore , further exploration of PCDSeBT - based PSCs is still warranted for high - performance PCEs by means of controlling the film morphology and improving electric contacts .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paragraph discusses the properties of a material called PCDSeBT, which is a derivative of PCDTBT, and its use in photovoltaic cells. The properties mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Absorption band: The material has a relative wider absorption band, which is due to strong intermolecular Se°°°Se interactions.\n2. Bandgap: The material has a lower bandgap, which is not specified in the paragraph.\n3. J SC (short-circuit current density): The material has a J SC value of 11.7 mA/cm², which is among the highest J SC values for PSCs based on PCDTBT derivatives.\n4. HOMO energy level: The material has a low HOMO energy level, which maintains a high V OC (open-circuit voltage) value.\n5. PCE (power conversion efficiency): The material has a PCE of 4.12%, which is about 37% higher than that obtained from a PCDTBT-based reference device.\n6. Film morphology: The paragraph suggests that controlling the film morphology of PCDSeBT is a feasible strategy for selective fine-tuning of LUMO levels, which achieves a high J SC value while nearly remaining a high V OC.\n7. Electric contacts: The paragraph suggests that improving electric contacts is another way to achieve high-performance PCEs in PCDSeBT-based PSCs.\n\nTherefore, the numerical values mentioned in the paragraph are:\n\n* J SC = 11.7 mA/cm²\n* PCE = 4.12%\n\nThe other properties mentioned in the paragraph, such as the bandgap and HOMO energy level, are not specified with numerical values."},
