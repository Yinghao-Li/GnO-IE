    {"role": "user", "content": "Please analyze the following paragraph and summarize the properties, including their numerical values, of the mentioned materials.\n\nParagraph: 8 The photocurrent response of all of these polymers extends to a wavelength of 1 μm ; however , the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of these PSCs in the wavelength range between 650 and 1100 nm is typically less than 10% , which results in low overall PCEs under AM1.5 simulated solar light. Up to now , the highest PCE of μmR - polymer was just 1.1% , based on poly(di-2-thienylthienopyrazine) by using complicated doubled active layers photovoltaic devices. 7 The fundamental requirements for promising photovoltaic μmR - polymers include the following : ( a ) broad absorption extending to or surpassing 1 μm to absorb more sunlight ; ( b ) a high LUMO energy level to allow effective photoinduced charge transfer from the polymers to the acceptor in the BHJ device and at the same time , a low HOMO level to keep the open circuit voltage ( V OC ) as high as possible ; ( c ) high carrier mobility to ensure that effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes suppresses photocurrent loss ; and ( d ) good solubility and appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives to form high - quality films by solution processing. The lack of successful photovoltaic μmR - polymers might be due to the difficulty of fulfilling all these requirements simultaneously with one polymer. Very recently , 3,6-dithien-2-yl-2 , 5-dialkylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DTDPP ) was shown to be a promising building block for the design of photovoltaic polymers. 9 In our previous work , we also found the polymer , PDTP - DTDPP , based on DTDPP and dithieno[3,2-b : 2^0 ,3 0 -d]pyrrole was one of potential μmRpolymers. The PCE based on this polymer arrived 1.1% , one of highest value for μmR-polymers. 10 Herein , we present a new donor - acceptor alternative conjugated polymer , changing the alkyl chain in the diketopyrrolopyrrole segment of PDTP - DTDPP from 2-ethylhexyl to n-butyl. This new polymer , referred to as PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) , is designed to fulfill the abovementioned requirements simultaneously as much as possible. As a result , bulk heterojunction - type polymer solar cells based on PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PC 70 BM have broad photocurrent response wavelength range from 300 nm to 1.1 μm. High shortcircuit current ( 14.87 mA / cm^2 ) and PCE ( 2.71% ) were achieved , which is a significant advance for efficient μmR-polymers. *Corresponding author. E-mail : hashimoto @ light.t.u - tokyo.ac.jp . Material Synthesis. The new polymer PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) was synthesized by coupling 3,6-di(2-bromothien-5-yl)-2 , 5dibutylpyrrolo[3,4-c] pyrrole-1,4-dione and 2,6-di(trimethyl- tin)-N-[1-(2 0 -ethylhexyl)-3-ethylheptanyl]dithieno[3,2-b : 2^0 ,3 0 -d]- pyrrole via a Stille reaction ( Scheme 1 ). The polymer has good solubility in CHCl 3 but is only partly soluble in chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. The number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of the polymer is 18.9 kg / mol with a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 2.04. Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) plots of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) is shown in Figure 1.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
