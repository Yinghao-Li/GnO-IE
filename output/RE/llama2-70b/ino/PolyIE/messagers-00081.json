Figure 5 shows the typical output and transfer curves of a representative device with PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) as the channel semiconductor. The hole mobility was estimated to be 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that of other effective D-A type low - bandgap photovoltaic polymers ( 2.6 x 10^-4 -3 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). 5 Although the FET mobility might not be directly correlated to the photovoltaic performance since the situation of the charge transport is quite different from each other , the higher carrier mobility still suggests effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes in the photovoltaic devices. Photovoltaic Properties. The bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PCBM ( or PC 70 BM ) / LiF / Al. PEDOT : PSS was spin - coated on a precleaned ITO - coated glass substrate. The film was dried at 150 °C under a N 2 atmosphere for 5 min. After cooling the substrate , a solution of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM ( or PC 70 BM ) mixture ( 1 : 2 w / w ) was spin - coated , where a blend of chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene ( 4 : 1 v / v ) was used as the solvent. The devices were completed by evaporating LiF / Al as the cathode. The effective area ( 2 mm x 3 mm ) of the PSCs was defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light ( Scheme 2 ). PC 70 BM was also used as an acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PCBM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region , which can compensate for the poor absorption of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) in this range. Figure 6 shows the I-V curves of the devices with the best photovoltaic performance under the illumination of AM 1.5 ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). The corresponding open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short - circuit current ( I SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and PCE of the devices are also summarized in Figure 3. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the devices under the illumination of monochromatic light is shown in Figure 3. Compared with the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PCBM system , the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PC 70 BM system has higher EQE values of 30-40 % in the range of 450-850 nm , which contributes to the improvement of I SC from 11.31 to 14.87 mA / cm^2. Since the spectral response extends to over 1.1 μm , the spectral mismatch between the simulated and actual AM1.5 spectra must be considered.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
