These AFM results are consistent with their photovoltaic device performances ( vide supra ). The reason for that may be due to both DCB and TCB are good solvents for PSFDTBT. It is well - known that balanced electron and hole mobility of the active layer is required for high performance polymer solar cells. 2f The formation of an interpenetrating bicontinuous network between polymer donor and PCBM with an ideal domain size of 10-20 nm is crucial for charge generation and transportation. 18 For bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells , appreciate phase separation is a practical way to form bicontinuous donor - acceptor network. 19 We believe that the solar cell performance of this type of copolymer can be further improved by the optimization of film morphology and device fabrication conditions . An alternating copolymer PSFDTBT of spirobifluorene and 2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole unit was designed and synthesized. PSFDTBT shows a broad absorption , appropriate HOMO / LUMO positions , and comparable hole mobility. Without using any additive and any post-treatment , polymer solar cells based on PSFDTBT / PC71BM demonstrated a PCE of 4.6% with a high open - circuit voltage of 0.94 V. This is the first report on spirobifluorene - based polymers applied in BHJ PSCs. High open - circuit voltage , simple device fabrication process , and easy synthesis make PSFDTBT a highly promising donor polymers for high efficiency polymer solar cells. We believe that spirobifluorene as a promising building block for conjugated polymer donor materials warrants further exploration and the performance of PSFDTBT - based polymer solar cells can be further improved from the optimization of device fabrication conditions .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
