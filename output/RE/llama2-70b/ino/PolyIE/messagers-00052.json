In contrast , the PCE suddenly decreased in the blended device of P5 and PC61BM ( 3.02% ) and further decreased in P6 ( 2.09% ) , mainly due to the significant decrease of the J SC . The low J SC values of P5 and P6 were unexpected , considering the lower band gaps of P5 ( 1.49 eV ) and P6 ( 1.55 eV ) compared to that of P7 ( 1.85 eV ). To better understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC values , the space - chargelimited current ( SCLC ) of hole - only devices of the P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 blended devices were measured and compared ( Figure S5 ). The hole - only devices were constructed under optimized device conditions with the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / blends / Au. The hole mobilities of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 were 1.14 × 10^-4 , 1.13 × 10^-4 , 1.09 × 10^-4 , 1.10 × 10^-4 , and 1.18 × 10^-5 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively , showing that the hole mobilities of all random terpolymers were similar to or 1 order of magnitude higher than their parent polymers. Therefore , the trend of the J SC can not be explained solely by the changes in the optical properties and the hole mobilities. To gain a better understanding of the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC and PCE values of the PBDTT- DPP - TPD random terpolymers , the molecular geometries and the electron density distribution were simulated using density functional theory ( DFT ) at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d,p) level with the Spartan 08 software package. Three repeating units were taken as a model for calculations , and methyl was used instead of the long side chains to reduce the computational time. Four model compounds , ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 , (BDTT-DPP)-(BDTT-TPD)-(BDTT-DPP) , (BDTT-TPD)-(BDTT-DPP)-(BDTT-TPD) , and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 were used and calculated for comparison. The optimized molecular geometries of the models and their calculated HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals are depicted in Figure 5 and Figure S7. In general , for alternative copolymers , the electron density in the HOMO wave functions is well delocalized. However , the LUMO wave function shows a different degree of localization in the electron density dependent on the types of the electron - withdrawing units. 46,47 This tendency was observed in ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 .\n\nLet's think step by step."},

P4 : PC71BM has the highest PCE among all the materials mentioned, which suggests that it has the best overall performance.\n2. The blended device of P5 and PC61BM has a lower PCE than P4 : PC71BM, and the J SC values of P5 and P6 are low. This suggests that the blending of P5 and PC61BM may not be optimal for efficient charge transfer.\n3. The hole mobilities of all the random terpolymers are similar or one order of magnitude higher than their parent polymers, which suggests that the hole mobility is not the primary factor affecting the J SC values.\n4. The simulation results show that the electron density in the HOMO wave functions is well delocalized for alternative copolymers, while the LUMO wave function shows a different degree of localization depending on the types of electron-withdrawing units. This suggests that the electronic properties of the materials play a significant role in determining their performance.\n\nIn summary, the properties of the materials mentioned in the paragraph suggest that the performance of the materials is influenced by a combination of factors, including their electronic properties, hole mobility, and blending ratio. The simulation results provide insight into the electronic properties of the materials and suggest that the localization of electrons in the LUMO wave function may play a role in determining their performance."},
