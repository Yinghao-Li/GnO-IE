The optical band gaps of the polymers could be tuned from 1.41 eV to 1.61 eV by changing the number of thiophene spacers. Electrochemical measurements showed that the increase of band gap is mainly due to the change of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level. The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymer solar cells based on the three polymers and PC 70 BM reached 3.12% with x = 2 under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . This approach could provide a simple strategy for designing high - performance D-A type photovoltaic polymers based on the existing polymers and a large potential to improve their performance further. â€  Electronic supplementary information ( ESI ) available : XRD patterns , DFT and TD - DFT calculations. See Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted much interest due to their great potential to be a renewable energy technology based on simple and low cost manufacture. [1][2][3] The concept of a bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) utilizing mixtures of a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative is regarded as an efficient system for photovoltaic application. 4 The most representative active layers of the blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) with fullerene derivatives were extensively investigated. [5][6][7] While the advantage of P3HT is its simple structure with a relatively high hole mobility , the weak point of P3HT as the photovoltaic donor material towards efficient PSCs is the mismatch of its absorption spectrum ( absorption edge is about 650 nm ) with the terrestrial solar spectrum. The band gap of P3HT ( 1.9 eV ) is larger than the optimum band gap range ( 1.3 - 1.5 eV ) for polymer - fullerene BHJ solar cells. 8 Hence , design of photovoltaic polymers with broader absorption toward longer wavelengths , especially in the near - infrared ( NIR ) range , is necessary for high efficiency conjugated polymer donor materials. Thanks to the many attempts that have been made to develop NIR absorbing polymers , a notable improvement of the overall power - conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been achieved. [9][10][11] One of the most powerful and flexible strategies to design low band gap conjugated polymers involves an alternating sequence of electron - donor ( D ) and electron - acceptor ( A ) moieties along the conjugated polymer main chain.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
