In the case of polymers , extremely limited results have been reported. 21,22 In the Takimiya group , recently , a polymer composed of QC derivatives has been reported for use in OTFTs that has a high hole mobility ( 0.2 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ). 23 In this study , we synthesized a new donor - acceptor type ( D- A type ) polymer , poly[quinacridone-alt-octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole] ( PQCDTB ) , which contained QC and octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole ( DTB ). As a result , it is most likely that a broad absorbance could be obtained as the results of the effective charge transport and the strong electron - withdrawing caused by the high coplanarity . Table 1 shows the result of the molecular weight and the thermal properties of the obtained PQCDTB. As shown in this table , when the GPC was measured using polystyrene as the standard , the number - average molecular weights ( M n ) of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were 49.8 and 15.2 kg / mol , respectively. In contrast , the polydispersity indices ( PDIs ) showed a very narrow distribution of 1.92 and 1.77 , respectively. In terms of the degree of polymerization , PQCDTB was greater than other OPV polymers by 2-3 times because of the introduction of long , branched side chains of quinacridone and benzothiadiazole. As a result , the backbone structure became relatively favorable in terms of the solubility at polymerization ; polymerization had effectively occurred. 6 Table 1 showed the result of the thermal analysis through TGA. As shown in Table 1 , PQCDTB and PCZDTB had a 5% weight loss at the temperatures of 323 and 324 °C , respectively , displaying a high thermal stability because of the rigid QC and carbazole structure , which is applicable for optoelectronic devices and OPVs , both of which require a high thermal stability ( 300 °C or above ). 24 We investigated thermal behavior through DSC analysis ( see Supporting Information ) , which revealed no obvious thermal transitions for PQCDTB in the temperature range from 40 to 250 ° C. Thus , PQCDTB displayed amorphous property. Figure 1 showed X-ray diffraction measurements of film to analyze the ordering structure of the obtained polymers.\n\nLet's think step by step."},

This suggests that the polymer has a more uniform structure.\n* Degree of polymerization: PQCDTB has a degree of polymerization that is 2-3 times higher than other OPV polymers, which means that it has a longer chain length.\n* Thermal stability: PQCDTB has a 5% weight loss at 323°C, which indicates that it has high thermal stability. This is likely due to the rigid QC and carbazole structure, which is favorable for optoelectronic devices and OPVs.\n* Amorphous property: PQCDTB displays an amorphous property, as revealed by DSC analysis (see Supporting Information). This suggests that the polymer has a disordered structure.\n\nOverall, PQCDTB has a unique combination of properties that make it a promising material for optoelectronic devices and OPVs. Its high thermal stability, high molecular weight, and amorphous property make it a suitable candidate for further investigation."},
