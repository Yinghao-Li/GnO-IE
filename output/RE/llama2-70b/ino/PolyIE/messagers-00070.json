It is also understood that the 3-fold higher chargecarrier mobility of PTATDPP than that of PTAFDPP arises from its stronger π-π stacking with a shorter d 010 , as discussed above. When the photovoltaic properties of copolymers are measured using PC71BM as an electron acceptor , it is found that the optimum blend ratio of polymer : PC71BM is 1 : 2 to afford the best PCE of both copolymers with the conventional device architecture of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al ( Fig. S2 and Table S1 † ). The best PCE was also achieved when o-dichlorobenzene was used as a solvent and the optimum thickness for the active layer was ca. 90 nm. The current density - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the optimized solar cells are shown in Fig. 4 , and the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Tables 2 and S2. † PTATDPP showed a best PCE of 6.69% ( V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 12.3 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.68 ) , while PTAFDPP showed a best PCE of 5.02% ( V OC = 0.76 V , J SC = 11.2 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.59 ). Both copolymers showed higher V OC s than other DPP - based copolymers due to their low - lying HOMO energy levels. Both copolymers also exhibited high J SC s and FFs , indicating their decent ability for charge generation and transport. Therefore , the TA unit is a promising electron - donating unit for low band - gap copolymers with a low - lying HOMO energy level. When the PSC devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture ( ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag ) in order to further improve the photovoltaic performance , the PCEs of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP - based devices were improved to 7.02% and 5.22% , respectively ( Fig. 4b , Tables 2 and S2 † ) , mainly due to enhanced J SC s ( V OC s and FFs were not changed significantly ). It is noteworthy here that the PCE of over 7% of PTATDPP is the highest efficiency of anthracene - based low band - gap conjugated copolymers. In spite of the same band - gap of the two copolymers , PTATDPP shows slightly higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP ( Fig. S3 † ). This can be ascribed to the closely packed microstructures of PTATDPP and thereby its high charge - carrier mobility than PTAFDPP. When the crystal structures of blend films of the copolymers with PC71BM were examined by XRD , the PTATDPP / PC71BM blend had strong and intense ( 100 ) diffraction while the PTAFDPP / PC71BM blend showed weak and broad ( 100 ) diffraction ( Fig. 2b ).\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. The paragraph discusses the properties of two copolymers, PTATDPP and PTAFDPP, and their use in organic solar cells.\n2. The copolymers have a high crystallinity due to the highly coplanar structure of anthracene and DPP.\n3. The charge-carrier mobility of PTATDPP is higher than that of PTAFDPP due to its stronger π-π stacking with a shorter d010.\n4. The optimum blend ratio of polymer to PC71BM for the best photovoltaic performance is 1:2.\n5. The best PCE (power conversion efficiency) was achieved with o-dichlorobenzene as a solvent and an active layer thickness of ca. 90 nm.\n6. PTATDPP showed a best PCE of 6.69% with VOC = 0.80 V, JSC = 12.3 mA cm^-2, and FF = 0.68, while PTAFDPP showed a best PCE of 5.02% with VOC = 0.76 V, JSC = 11.2 mA cm^-2, and FF = 0.59.\n7. Both copolymers showed high VOCs than other DPP-based copolymers due to their low-lying HOMO energy levels.\n8. Both copolymers also exhibited high JSCs and FFs, indicating their decent ability for charge generation and transport.\n9. The PCEs of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP-based devices were improved to 7.02% and 5.22%, respectively, with an inverted architecture.\n10. PTATDPP shows slightly higher JSC and FF than PTAFDPP, which can be attributed to its closely packed microstructures and high charge-carrier mobility.\n11. The crystal structures of blend films of the copolymers with PC71BM were examined by XRD, and PTATDPP/PC71BM blend had strong and intense (100) diffraction, while PTAFDPP/PC71BM blend showed weak and broad (100) diffraction.\n\nNumerical values:\n\n* PCE: 6.69% (PTATDPP), 5.02% (PTAFDPP)\n* VOC: 0.80 V (PTATDPP), 0.76 V (PTAFDPP)\n* JSC: 12.3 mA cm^-2 (PTATDPP), 11.2 mA cm^-2 (PTAFDPP)\n* FF: 0.68 (PTATDPP), 0.59 (PTAFDPP)\n* d010: shorter (PTATDPP)\n* Optimum blend ratio: 1:2 (PTATDPP and PTAFDPP)\n* Active layer thickness: ca. 90 nm\n* Solvent: o-dichlorobenzene\n\nNote: The numerical values are based on the information provided in the paragraph and may not be a comprehensive list of all numerical values mentioned."},
