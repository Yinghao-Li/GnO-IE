V eff = V 0 - V , where V 0 is the voltage at which J L = J D and V is the applied voltage. When the reverse voltage is greater than 2 V , recombination will be suppressed because of a high internal electric field and thus the current density becomes saturated ( J sat ). Consequently , P(E,T) = J ph / J sat could be used to describe the charge dissociation probability. The charge dissociation probability of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based cells was estimated to be 0.86 , 0.94 , 0.98 , and 0.92 , respectively. The highest exciton dissociation of the PffBB-14 - based device is anticipated to give rise to the best photovoltaic performance among these series of polymers. Figure 7 demonstrates the dependence of V oc and J sc against light intensity , which could be used to describe the recombination process in BHJ films. The V oc is directly proportional to the incident light intensity in the semilogarithmic plot with a slope of kT / q , which describes bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film , where k represents the Boltzmann constant , T is the Kelvin temperature , and q is the elementary charge. Trap - assisted recombination exists if the slope is larger than kT / q. 42 Among devices fabricated , the PffBB-14 - based cell exhibited the smallest slope of 1.10 kT / q , suggesting the least trap - assisted recombination. Bimolecular recombination was also investigated by measuring the dependence of J sc against light intensity , in which the exponential factor α in the power law of J sc ∝ P light α is used Article to indicate bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film. The closer the estimated α to 1.0 , the weaker the bimolecular recombination occurs in the device. 43 Obviously , with α = 0.98 , the PffBB-14 - based device would exhibit the least occurrence of bimolecular recombination in the active layer. In contrast , the PffBB-10 - based device showed an α value of 0.86 , indicating that the bimolecular recombination loss was severe in its BHJ film. These results consistently indicate that the PffBB-14:PC71BM blend with superior balanced charge carrier transport exhibits the least recombination loss among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs , thus affording the highest J sc and FF. Morphology of the Active Layer. AFM images of PffBBn : PC71BM blended thin films were obtained to investigate their microphase separation behavior and the corresponding AFM height and phase images recorded in the tapping mode are shown in Figure 8. Good miscibility could be observed in all of the PffBB-n:PC71BM blended thin films , which gives rise to desirable phase separation.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
