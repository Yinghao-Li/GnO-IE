The PQCDTB dissolved in general organic solvents , and the M n was 49.8 kg / mol. The optical band gap energy was 1.92 eV , which was similar to the band gap of benzothiadiazole. The HOMO and LUMO levels of PQCDTB were -5.24 eV and -3.32 eV , respectively. According to the XRD measurement , PQCDTB showed the formation of ordered lamellar structure as an out - of - plane peak ( h00 ) by the alkyl side chain of quinacridone and conventional edge-on πstacking. This study also evaluated the OPV characteristics by fabricating a bulk - heterojunction - type polymer solar cell. When PQCDTB and PC71BM were fabricated in a 1 : 1 weight ratio , the open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short - circuit current ( J SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8% and 2.5% , respectively. In particular , PQCDTB exhibited higher FFs compared with poly[carbazole-alt-benzothiadiazole] ( PCZDTB ) . For the past several decades , semiconducting polymers have been applied to various sectors , such as organic light emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , 1-4 organic photovoltaic cells ( OPVs ) 5-9 and organic thin film transistors ( OTFTs ). 10-13 Of these applications , OPVs have become mainstream , thanks to their outstanding economic feasibility and sustainable development. Nevertheless , a low power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been the largest obstacle in OPVs. 6 To improve the PCE , the following idealistic conditions are required in conjugated polymers : 14 ( 1 ) a low bandgap with a wide absorption area , ( 2 ) a crystalline structure to produce good charge transport characteristics , ( 3 ) a low highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level to produce a high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and ( 4 ) an appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level for effective electron charge transfer to fullerene. To acquire good charge transport characteristics , it is necessary to increase the close packing among polymers through the reduction of energetic disorder by increasing the coplanarity and the interchain π-π interaction. In the Janssen group , a copolymer containing terthiophene was reported , which shows an increase in planarity packing and high mobility characteristics , and a diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative showed a PCE of 4.7% and a high hole mobility ( 0.04 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ). 15 In the Jen group , a hole mobility of 0.029 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 and a PCE of 6.2% were reported in a copolymer that contained an indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) unit and a phenanthrenequinoxaline unit.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
