The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference of the HOMO energy levels and optical band gaps according to the equation : LUMO = ( HOMO + E opt g ) eV , which lies in the range of -3.79 ∼ -3.88 eV. The electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. All polymers showed very deep HOMO levels of ca. -5.5 eV , which were much lower than the reported benzodithiophene-NT ( PBDT - DTNT ) based poly- mers , 20 illustrating that IDT was a good donor unit that can offer deep HOMO level and high V oc of the PSCs based on the target polymers can be anticipated. Mobility. Hole mobility of donor polymers played an important role in the OPV performance of the resulting PSCs. 53 In order to evaluate the hole mobility of the resulting polymers , corresponding hole - only devices with configuration o f I T O / p o l y ( 3 , 4 -e t h y l e n e d i o x y t h i o p h e n e ) : p o l y -(styrenesulfonate) ( PEDOT : PSS ) / polymer / MoO 3 / Al were fabricated and the hole mobilities were obtained by using the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) model. The calculated hole mobilities of PIDT - EHNT , PIDT - DTNT , and PIDT-C12NT were 9.84 × 10^-5 , 1.66 × 10^-4 , and 2.42 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. When considering that PIDT-C12NT shows higher hole mobility and superior absorption to that of PIDT - EHNT and PIDT - DTNT , it is rational to envisage that PIDT-C12NT would achieve superior processability and backbone planarity among three polymers. Morphology. Insight into the nanoscale surface topography of the polymer : PC71BM blend films with weight ratio of 1 : 2 were carried out by tapping mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). As can be seen in Figure 5 , blend films based on PIDT - EHNT and PIDT - DTNT with PC71BM showed unexpected phase separation , with corresponding domain size over 200 and 100 nm , respectively which are much larger than typical exciton diffusion length of ca. 10 nm. 54,55 In contrast , PIDT-C12NT based blend film displayed an interpenetrating bicontinuous network between polymer and PC71BM with optimal domain size of 10-20 nm that is pretty favorable for efficient diffusion of excitons to donor - acceptor interface.\n\nLet's think step by step."},

HOMO and LUMO energy levels: All three polymers have similar HOMO energy levels, which are around -5.5 eV. This indicates that they have similar electron donating ability. The LUMO energy levels are also similar, ranging from -3.79 to -3.88 eV, which suggests that they have similar electron accepting ability.\n2. Hole mobility: PIDT-C12NT has the highest hole mobility among the three polymers, followed by PIDT-DTNT and PIDT-EHNT. This means that PIDT-C12NT has the best ability to transport holes, which is beneficial for OPV performance.\n3. Morphology: PIDT-C12NT shows an interpenetrating bicontinuous network with PC71BM, which is favorable for efficient diffusion of excitons to the donor-acceptor interface. In contrast, PIDT-EHNT and PIDT-DTNT exhibit phase separation with larger domain sizes, which may lead to inefficient exciton diffusion and reduced OPV performance.\n\nIn summary, PIDT-C12NT has the best overall properties among the three polymers for OPV applications, with the highest hole mobility and favorable morphology."},
