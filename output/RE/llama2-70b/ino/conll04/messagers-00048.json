However, the paragraph does not provide enough information to confirm whether Walesa's employment as a shipyard electrician was related to his involvement with the Solidarity union movement.\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that Walesa may have had a significant role in the Solidarity union movement, but the paragraph does not provide enough evidence to confirm a direct employment or association relationship between Walesa and the organization."},
