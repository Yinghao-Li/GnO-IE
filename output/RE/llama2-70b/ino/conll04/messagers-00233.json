However, we can infer that Jack Ruby was associated with the legal system in Dallas, Texas, as he was on trial and was found guilty by a jury. Additionally, Lee Harvey Oswald was associated with the United States government, as he was accused of assassinating the President of the United States.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph does not explicitly mention any individuals employed by or associated with specific organizations, but we can make some inferences based on the context."},
