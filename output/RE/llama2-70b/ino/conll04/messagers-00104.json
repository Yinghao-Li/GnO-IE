This means that Branstad will be in a position of authority over Gardner, and Gardner's role as vice chairman is subordinate to Branstad's role as chairman. Therefore, the relationship between Branstad and Gardner can be seen as a \"Killer kills the Victim\" relationship, with Branstad having the power to potentially harm or overshadow Gardner in their roles within the association."},
