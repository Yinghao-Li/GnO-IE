The use of the phrase \"repeated previous administration recommendations\" implies that the suggestion to construct the heavy water reactor has been made before and is being reiterated, which could be seen as a threat to the new design gas-cooled reactor. Additionally, the fact that the heavy water reactor is described as \"heavy water\" and the gas-cooled reactor is described as \"new design\" could imply that the former is more established or traditional, while the latter is newer and less proven, which could create a sense of competition or conflict between the two."},
