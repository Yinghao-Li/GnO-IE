The Soviet Union is the country that owns the ships mentioned in the paragraph, and is therefore the country where the ships are primarily operated from.\n2. Cuba is the location where the missile crisis took place, and is therefore the location where the ships were headed.\n3. The United States is the country whose president, Kennedy, implemented the naval blockade, and is therefore the country that was involved in the crisis.\n\nThe pattern that indicates the relationship between the locations is the mention of the countries' leaders and their actions in relation to the crisis. The fact that the Soviet Union's leader, Nikita Khrushchev, instructed the Soviet ships to ignore the blockade, while the United States' president, Kennedy, implemented the blockade, indicates that the two countries were involved in a confrontation. The mention of Cuba as the location of the missile crisis further confirms the relationship between the three locations."},
