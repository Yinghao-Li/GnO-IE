However, I did notice that the written statement released by Eu's office could be considered as having a location within a location relationship.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the locations mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n1. Los Angeles - This is the location where the LAPD investigation took place.\n2. Sirhan Sirhan - This is the location where the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy occurred.\n3. Eu's office - This is the location where the written statement was released.\n\nWhile there are no direct \"Location A is located in Location B\" relationships, we can infer that Eu's office is located in a different location than Los Angeles, since the investigation was conducted by the LAPD in Los Angeles, and Eu's office is releasing a statement about it.\n\nTherefore, we can establish the following location relationships:\n\n1. Eu's office is located outside of Los Angeles.\n2. Sirhan Sirhan is located within Los Angeles.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."},
