The presence of this name in the paragraph suggests that the article may be discussing a person who is associated with this media outlet, such as a journalist or writer.\n\nThe second clue is the text \"Kiev,\" which is a city in Ukraine. This could indicate that the person being discussed in the article is based in Kiev and may be working for an organization located in that city.\n\nFinally, the last sentence of the paragraph \"Let's think step by step\" suggests that the author of the article may be encouraging readers to follow a logical thought process. This could potentially be a style of writing commonly used in editorials or opinion pieces, which may suggest that the author is a writer or journalist employed by an organization such as a newspaper or magazine.\n\nBased on these clues, it is possible that the paragraph may be discussing an individual who is employed by or associated with a media organization, such as a newspaper or magazine, located in Kiev, Ukraine, and that the person may be a journalist or writer. However, without additional context or information, it is not possible to confirm this relationship with certainty."},
