Mention of a city or region in the name of the organization, such as \"Atlantic City Bank\" or \"Jersey Shore Medical Center.\"\n2. Use of a location-specific adjective to describe the organization, such as \"Atlantic City-based\" or \"New Jersey-focused.\"\n3. Mention of a location in the context of the organization's operations or services, such as \"serving the Atlantic City community\" or \"providing healthcare services to residents of New Jersey.\"\n4.
