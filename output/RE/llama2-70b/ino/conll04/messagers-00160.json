However, we can identify a pattern that suggests a possible relationship between the organization and Belarus.\n\nThe name \"Belarusian\" in the phrase \"Belarusian Let's think step by step\" suggests that the organization is headquartered or primarily operates in Belarus. The use of the adjective \"Belarusian\" to describe the organization implies a strong connection to Belarus, which could indicate that the organization is based in Belarus or has significant operations in the country.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that S. Gusak, the deputy chairman of the organization, is writing an article about thinking step by step, suggests that the organization is likely involved in education, training, or consulting, which are industries that often have a strong presence in Belarus.\n\nTherefore, based on the patterns observed in the text, it is likely that the organization where S. Gusak is the deputy chairman is headquartered or primarily operates in Belarus."},
