However, it does imply that he was present in South Africa at the time of his nomination as president, as it mentions that he was nominated for the position in the Republic of South Africa. Additionally, it is widely known that Mandela spent a significant amount of time in South Africa, including his imprisonment on Robben Island, and later serving as the country's first black president. So while the paragraph does not directly state that Mandela resides or has resided in a specific location, it does suggest that he has a strong connection to South Africa."},

Here's the analysis of the given paragraph to identify any relationships where an individual is employed by or associated with a specific organization.\n\nThe paragraph mentions \"Parliament\" and \"Republic of South Africa\" which are organizations.

The use of the title \"Mr.\" suggests that Mandela is an adult and may have a professional or formal relationship with the organization.
