However, we can infer a possible relationship based on the context.\n\nMarkman's statement suggests that he is associated with Israel, and he mentions that he had come from Israel. This implies that Markman may be a representative or an ambassador of Israel, or he may have some other kind of affiliation with the country.\n\nSirhan, on the other hand, is described as having killed Kennedy for his warm feelings toward Israel. This implies that Sirhan may have had a negative view of Kennedy's stance towards Israel, and may have been motivated by a desire to harm someone who was perceived as being supportive of Israel.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can identify the following possible relationships:\n\n1. Markman is associated with Israel.\n2. Sirhan had a negative view of Kennedy's stance towards Israel.\n\nIt's important to note that these are inferences based on the given paragraph, and there may be other possible interpretations depending on the context in which the paragraph is being used."},
