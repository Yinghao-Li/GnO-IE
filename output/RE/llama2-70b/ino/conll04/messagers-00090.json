Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:\n\n- \"About 1 , 000 soldiers from Fort Lewis , Wash. , were summoned to Oregon for on-the-job training before being thrown on to the front lines.\"\n\nThe paragraph implies that the soldiers reside in Fort Lewis, Wash., as it mentions that they were summoned from there.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the soldiers reside in Fort Lewis, Wash., but not necessarily in Oregon.\n\nSo, to summarize, the paragraph implies that the soldiers reside in Fort Lewis, Wash., but does not provide any information about their residency in Oregon."},
