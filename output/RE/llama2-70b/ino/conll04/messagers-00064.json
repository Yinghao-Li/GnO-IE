It is possible that some individuals are employed by Minox, but the paragraph does not provide any information about their employment status.\n2.

Like Leica, it is possible that some individuals are employed by Rollei.\n\nBased on the information provided in the paragraph, we can identify the following relationships:\n\n1.
