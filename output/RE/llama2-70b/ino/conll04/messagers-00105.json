The context of the sentence suggests that he is dealing with forest fires in the state, which implies that the organization he is affiliated with (in this case, the state government) operates primarily in Idaho. Therefore, we can infer a relationship between the organization (Idaho state government) and the location (Idaho).\n\nPatterns that indicate this type of relationship include:\n\n1. Mention of a specific location (Idaho) in conjunction with a person or organization (Gov. Cecil Andrus, Idaho state government)\n2. Use of language that implies the organization operates in the specified location (e.g., \"totally out of control\" suggests the forest fires are in Idaho)\n3. The person or organization being associated with a role or responsibility that is specific to the location (Gov. Andrus is responsible for dealing with forest fires in Idaho)"},
