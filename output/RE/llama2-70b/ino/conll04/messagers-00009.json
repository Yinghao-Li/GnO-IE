However, this is purely speculative, and the paragraph does not provide enough information to confirm this assumption.\n\nTherefore, while the paragraph does not explicitly state that Alekseev resides or has resided in a specific location, it does imply that he may have had some connection to Moscow, either through his work in the Soviet diplomatic corps or through his physical location."},
