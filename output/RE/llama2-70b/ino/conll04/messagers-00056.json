Husk, the executive director, suggests that the organization has a broad scope and influence. This implies that the organization is likely headquartered in a major city, possibly one with a large urban school district.\n\nAdditionally, the use of the phrase \"great city schools\" suggests that the organization may be focused on urban education in major metropolitan areas, which could imply a presence in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, or other large urban centers.\n\nTherefore, while the text does not explicitly state the location of the Council of Great City Schools, the language used suggests that the organization is likely headquartered or primarily operates in a major urban area, possibly in the United States."},
