Names of cities or towns: Look for names of cities or towns mentioned in the text that could indicate the location of an organization's headquarters or primary operations.\n2. Organization names: Look for names of organizations mentioned in the text that could indicate the location of their headquarters or primary operations.\n3. Context: Consider the context in which the location and organization names appear. Are they mentioned in the same sentence or paragraph? Are they related to each other in some way?\n\nApplying this approach to the given paragraph, we can identify the following possible relationships:\n\n1. Wallace, S.D. - Hubert H. Humphrey: The paragraph mentions that Hubert H. Humphrey, the 38th U.S. vice president, was born in Wallace, S.D.

Englewood, N.J. - Charles Lindbergh: The paragraph mentions that aviator Charles Lindbergh married Anne Spencer Morrow in Englewood, N.J. This suggests that Englewood, N.J. may be the location where Lindbergh lived or operated his aviation business.\n3.

This suggests that the Supreme Court may be headquartered or primarily operate in Washington, D.C., which is the capital of the United States and the location of the Supreme Court building.\n\nOverall, the patterns that indicate relationships between locations and organizations in the paragraph are:\n\n1. Names of cities or towns mentioned in conjunction with notable events or people related to an organization.\n2.
