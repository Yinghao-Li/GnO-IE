However, there is no mention of Oswald being employed by any other organization besides the Texas School Book Depository.\n3. Jim Bakker: Bakker was a televangelist and founder of the PTL Club, a popular Christian television program. It can be inferred that Bakker was employed by or associated with the PTL Club, as he was its founder and host.\n4.
