Here's the analysis of the given paragraph:\n\nThe paragraph mentions two organizations:\n\n* DOE (Department of Energy)\n* SRP (Savannah River Plant)\n\nThe sentence structure and word choice suggest that DOE is the parent organization, and SRP is a subsidiary or a research facility under DOE. The phrase \"who directs DOE environmental studies at the SRP\" implies that SRP is a location where DOE conducts its environmental studies, and Steve Wright is the director of those studies at that location.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between DOE and SRP is that of a parent organization and a subsidiary or a research facility. The pattern indicating this relationship is the use of the phrase \"at the SRP\" after mentioning DOE, which suggests that SRP is a specific location where DOE operates or has a presence."},
