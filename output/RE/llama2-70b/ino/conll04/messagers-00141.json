However, we can identify a pattern that suggests the National Alliance is associated with Italy.\n\nThe name \"Gianfranco Fini\" is a common Italian name, and the fact that he is identified as the leader of the National Alliance suggests that the organization is likely based in Italy or has a significant presence there.
