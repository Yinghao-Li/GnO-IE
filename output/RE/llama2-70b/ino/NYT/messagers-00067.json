To determine the hierarchical relationship between two geographical locations, we need to identify which location is broader and encompasses the other.\n\nOne way to do this is to use a top-down approach, starting with the largest geographical entity and narrowing down to the more specific location.\n\n1. Start with the largest geographical entity:\n * United States\n2. Identify the next level of geographical entities:\n * States (New York, Ohio, Washington, Connecticut)\n3. Identify the more specific locations within each state:\n * Long Island (New York)\n * Cleveland Heights (Ohio)\n * Seattle (Washington)\n * Olympia (Washington)\n * Wilton (Connecticut)\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that the hierarchical relationship between the two locations is as follows:\n\n* United States (broader)\n + States (more specific)\n  - New York (more specific)\n   - Long Island (most specific)\n  - Ohio (more specific)\n   - Cleveland Heights (most specific)\n  - Washington (more specific)\n   - Seattle (most specific)\n   - Olympia (most specific)\n  - Connecticut (more specific)\n   - Wilton (most specific)\n\nTherefore, the hierarchical relationship between the two locations mentioned in the paragraph is:\n\n* United States (broader)\n + States (more specific)\n  - New York (more specific)\n   - Long Island (most specific)\n\nIn this case, \"United States\" is the broader location that encompasses all the other locations mentioned, and \"Long Island\" is the most specific location that is encompassed by \"New York\" and ultimately by \"United States\"."},
