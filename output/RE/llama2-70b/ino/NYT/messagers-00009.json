The author is likely residing in a country that is aligned with the United States and its Sunni Arab allies, or is at least sympathetic to their cause.\n2. The author is not residing in Iran or Syria, as these countries are portrayed as being on the opposing side of the proxy war.\n\nIt is important to note that these inferences are based on a very limited amount of information and may not be entirely accurate.
