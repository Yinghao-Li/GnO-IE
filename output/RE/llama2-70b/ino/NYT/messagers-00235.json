    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paragraph mentions several architects and their works, but it doesn't explicitly state where they lived. However, we can identify some relationships that suggest where certain individuals resided:\n\n1. Rudolf M. Schindler: The paragraph mentions \"houses by Rudolf M. Schindler.\" Schindler was an Austrian-American architect who settled in Los Angeles, California, in 1920. Therefore, it can be inferred that some of the houses he designed are located in Los Angeles or its surrounding areas.\n2. Richard Neutra: Similar to Schindler, Neutra was also an Austrian-American architect who settled in Los Angeles. The paragraph mentions \"houses by Richard Neutra.\" As Neutra spent most of his career in Los Angeles, it is likely that the houses he designed are located in the same region.\n3. Frank Lloyd Wright: Wright was an American architect who was born in Richland Center, Wisconsin, but later moved to Chicago, Illinois, and eventually settled in Scottsdale, Arizona. The paragraph mentions \"houses by Frank Lloyd Wright.\" While Wright's works can be found across the United States, it is likely that some of the houses mentioned in the paragraph are located in the Midwest, particularly in Illinois and Wisconsin, where Wright spent a significant part of his career.\n4. Lloyd Wright: Lloyd Wright, Frank Lloyd Wright's son, was also an architect. The paragraph mentions \"houses by Lloyd Wright.\" As Lloyd Wright spent most of his career in Los Angeles, it is likely that the houses he designed are located in the same region as his father's works.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can infer that some of the houses designed by Rudolf M. Schindler, Richard Neutra, and Lloyd Wright are located in Los Angeles or its surrounding areas, while some of Frank Lloyd Wright's works are likely located in the Midwest, particularly in Illinois and Wisconsin."},
