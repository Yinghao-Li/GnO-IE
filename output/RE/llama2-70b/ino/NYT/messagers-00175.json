Mississippi is also a state, located in the southern United States.\n\nThe United States is a country that encompasses all 50 states, including Georgia and Mississippi. Therefore, the United States is the broader location that encompasses both Georgia and Mississippi.\n\nHowever, since we are asked to identify the hierarchical relationship between the two locations mentioned in the paragraph, we need to compare their relative sizes and boundaries within the United States.\n\nGeorgia is a state located in the southeastern United States, and Mississippi is a state located in the southern United States. Both states are part of the same country, the United States.\n\nTherefore, the hierarchical relationship between Georgia and Mississippi is that Georgia is a broader location that encompasses Mississippi. Georgia is a state that includes multiple counties, cities, and towns, while Mississippi is a state that is smaller in size and located within the boundaries of Georgia.\n\nIn summary, the hierarchical relationship between Georgia and Mississippi is:\n\nGeorgia (broader location)\nMississippi (more specific location)\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Georgia encompasses Mississippi."},
