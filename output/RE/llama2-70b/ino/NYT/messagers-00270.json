First, let's identify the two locations mentioned:\n * Location 1: Syria\n * Location 2: Jordan\n2. Next, let's examine the context in which the locations are mentioned:\n * \"Weapons and fighters flow into the country primarily from Syria and Iran\" - This sentence suggests that Syria is a source of weapons and fighters that are flowing into another country (not specified).\n * \"Jordan and Syria are bristling about the nearly two million Iraqi refugees who have streamed over their borders\" - This sentence suggests that Jordan and Syria are both affected by the influx of Iraqi refugees crossing their borders.\n3. Based on the context, it appears that Syria is the broader location that encompasses Jordan, as Jordan is mentioned as being affected by events happening in Syria (weapons and fighters flowing in) and both countries are mentioned as being impacted by the refugee crisis.\n\nTherefore, the hierarchical relationship between the two locations is:\n\nSyria (broader location)\n└─ Jordan (more specific location)\n\nIn summary, Syria is the broader location that encompasses Jordan, as it is the source of weapons and fighters flowing into another country and both countries are affected by the refugee crisis."},
