The mention of \"cosmopolitan, globally connected metropolises\" in the context of Bangalore and Hyderabad implies that these cities have a more diverse population and stronger connections to the global economy, which could suggest that individuals from different parts of India or even the world may have moved to these cities for work or other opportunities.\n\nIn summary, while the paragraph does not directly state where an individual resided, it provides some hints about the cities' characteristics, which could help infer possible relationships regarding residency."},
