In other words, Kentucky encompasses Iraq.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that Kentucky is a state in the United States, while Iraq is a country in the Middle East. As a state, Kentucky is a subdivision of a larger country, the United States, and therefore encompasses smaller geographical areas within its borders, such as cities, counties, and towns. Iraq, on the other hand, is a separate country that is not part of the United States and is therefore not within the borders of Kentucky.\n\nTherefore, the hierarchical relationship between Kentucky and Iraq is that Kentucky is the broader location that encompasses the more specific location of Iraq."},
