Identify the people mentioned in the paragraph:\n\nThe paragraph mentions two people:\n\n* WEINGRAD Irving\n* The author of the paragraph (who is not named)\n2. Determine the nationality of WEINGRAD Irving:\n\nThe surname \"WEINGRAD\" is of German origin, suggesting that WEINGRAD Irving may have been of German descent. However, without more information, it's impossible to confirm this assumption.\n3. Determine the nationality of the author of the paragraph:\n\nThe author of the paragraph does not provide any information about their nationality.
