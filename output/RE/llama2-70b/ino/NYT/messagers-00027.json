It does not provide any information about the location of individuals.\n* \"defendants can not be tried in absentia\" - This phrase suggests that the legal system in Germany does not allow for defendants to be tried in absentia, implying that defendants must be physically present in Germany for a trial to take place. This does not directly indicate where any individual resides, but it does suggest that defendants who are subject to trial in Germany must be located in Germany at some point during the legal process.\n\nOverall, the paragraph does not explicitly state where any individual resides, but it does suggest that Germany is the location where certain legal proceedings take place, and that defendants who are subject to those proceedings must be physically present in Germany at some point."},
