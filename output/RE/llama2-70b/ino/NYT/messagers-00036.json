Friends of Putin are mentioned as beneficiaries of the massive transfer of property rights from so-called oligarchs.

Sergey V. Lavrov is the subordinate of Putin, as he is the Foreign Minister of Russia and reports to Putin.\n2. Condoleezza Rice is the counterpart of Sergey V. Lavrov, as she is the Secretary of State of the United States and works with Lavrov on international issues.\n3.
