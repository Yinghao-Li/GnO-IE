Netherlands - Europe\n2. United States - North America\n3. Australia - Oceania\n\nStep 2: Identify the broader location that encompasses at least two of the specific locations.\n\nIn this case, we can see that both the Netherlands and the United States are located in the same continent, North America. Therefore, North America is the broader location that encompasses both the Netherlands and the United States.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the third location (Australia) is also part of the broader location (North America).\n\nSince Australia is located in the continent of Oceania, it is not part of North America. Therefore, North America does not encompass all three locations.\n\nStep 4: Identify the next broader location that encompasses all three locations.\n\nThe next broader location that encompasses all three locations is the world. The world is the highest level of geographical classification and includes all countries and continents.\n\nTherefore, the hierarchical relationship between the three locations mentioned in the paragraph is as follows:\n\nWorld (broadest)\nNorth America (broader)\nEurope (specific)\nOceania (specific)\n\nIn this hierarchy, North America is the broader location that encompasses the Netherlands and the United States, while the world is the broadest location that encompasses all three locations."},
