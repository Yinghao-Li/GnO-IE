Determine which location is broader:\n * Germany is a country that encompasses multiple states, including Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, where Stuttgart is located.\n * The United States is a country that encompasses multiple states, including New York, where Manhattan is located.\n4. Compare the two locations:\n * Germany is a country that encompasses multiple states, while Manhattan is a borough of a city in a state.\n * The United States is a country that encompasses multiple states, while Stuttgart is a city in a state.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that:\n\n* The United States is a broader location that encompasses Manhattan.\n* Germany is a broader location that encompasses Stuttgart.\n\nTherefore, the hierarchical relationship between the two locations is:\n\n1.
