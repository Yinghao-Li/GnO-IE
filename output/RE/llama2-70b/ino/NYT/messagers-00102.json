The third column indicates whether the broader location contains the specific location. For example, the broader location \"World\" contains the specific location \"Europe\", and the specific location \"Paris\" is contained within the broader location \"France\". However, the specific location \"Top of the Eiffel Tower\" is not contained within the broader location \"Eiffel Tower\", because it refers to a specific part of the Eiffel Tower rather than the tower itself."}

However, we can infer some possible locations based on the information provided.\n\n1. The headquarters of Digitas, the online marketing agency led by David Kenny, is likely located in the same city or region where David Kenny resides. Although the text does not mention the location of the headquarters explicitly, it's common for companies to have their headquarters in a major city or a hub for their industry. Therefore, it's possible that David Kenny lives in a city with a significant presence of technology and marketing companies.\n2. The text implies that David Kenny is actively involved in the operations of Digitas, which suggests that he is currently living in the same city where the company is headquartered. This is because the phrase \"our clients\" suggests a sense of proximity and direct involvement with the clients, which would be more challenging to maintain if David Kenny were living in a different location.\n\nIn summary, while the text does not directly state where David Kenny lives, it suggests that he likely resides in a city with a significant technology and marketing industry, possibly in the same city where Digitas has its headquarters."},
