The table above shows the relationships that can be inferred from the text, such as Mr. Giuliani being a fan of the Yankees, and the locations (New York, New Hampshire, Iowa, Florida, and South Carolina) being places Mr. Giuliani visited or was planning to visit.

Therefore, we can conclude that New York is the broader location that encompasses none of the other specific locations mentioned.\n\nNew Hampshire, Iowa, Florida, and South Carolina are all separate states, and none of them are part of New York.
