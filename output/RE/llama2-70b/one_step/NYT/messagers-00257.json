Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Person | Nationality | Whether the Person has the Nationality |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Senator Mitch McConnell | American | Yes |\n\nIn this paragraph, only one person is mentioned - Senator Mitch McConnell. He is identified as American, and since he is a Senator from Kentucky, it is reasonable to assume that he has American nationality. Therefore, the table above shows \"American\" in the \"Nationality\" column and \"Yes\" in the \"Whether the Person has the Nationality\" column for Senator Mitch McConnell."}

The broader location in the paragraph is \"United States.\"\n2. The specific location mentioned is \"Kentucky.\"\n3. The broader location \"United States\" contains the specific location \"Kentucky,\" as Kentucky is a state within the United States.\n4. The specific location \"Senate\" is not a geographical location but an institution that exists within the broader location \"United States.\" Therefore, it cannot be included in the hierarchy.\n\nHence, the table above shows the valid relationships between the geographical locations mentioned in the paragraph."}
