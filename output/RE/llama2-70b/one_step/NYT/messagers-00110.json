'Minnesota' is a state in the United States, while 'Tuesday' is a day of the week. 'Tuesday' cannot contain 'Minnesota' as it's a day of the week and cannot physically hold a state. Therefore, 'Minnesota' encompasses 'Tuesday', meaning 'Minnesota' is the broader location, and 'Tuesday' is the more specific location.\n\nThe table shows the relationship between the two locations, with 'Minnesota' as the broader location and 'Tuesday' as the specific location. The third column indicates that 'Minnesota' contains 'Tuesday', which means that 'Tuesday' occurs within the boundaries of 'Minnesota'."}
