This implies that the person convicted was not the one who died in Srebrenica, but rather someone who was convicted for crimes related to the killings that took place there. Therefore, the relationship between Srebrenica and the person convicted is not \"the person died in Srebrenica\", but rather \"Srebrenica is the location where the crimes related to the person's conviction took place\".\n\nHowever, we can infer that there are unnamed individuals who died in Srebrenica, as the paragraph mentions that human rights groups linked the crimes to the killings in Srebrenica. Therefore, we can create a relationship between Srebrenica and an unnamed individual who died there, which is represented in the table above."}
