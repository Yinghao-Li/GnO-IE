Russia and China are both mentioned as individual countries, so they are on the same hierarchical level. Therefore, there is no broader location that encompasses both Russia and China.\n2. China is mentioned as a country that has a diplomatic relationship with Iran, and Iran is a specific location within the broader location of China. Therefore, China is the broader location that encompasses Iran.\n\nNote that the relationship between Russia and China is not explicitly stated in the given paragraph, so we cannot infer a hierarchical relationship between them."}
