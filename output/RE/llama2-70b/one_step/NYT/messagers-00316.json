Here's the table you requested:\n\n| Person | Location | Whether the Person died in the Location |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Unknown | Chicago's West Side | Yes |\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe paragraph mentions that the police were called to a bloody crime scene on Chicago's West Side, which implies that someone died at that location. However, the paragraph does not mention the name of the person who died, so we cannot determine who died at that location. Therefore, the table above lists \"Unknown\" as the person who died, and \"Chicago's West Side\" as the location where they died, with a \"Yes\" in the third column to indicate that the person did die at that location."}
