Therefore, I cannot provide a Markdown table with birthplace connections.\n\nHowever, I can suggest a possible way to extend the cease-fire to the West Bank while ensuring its proper enforcement in Gaza. One possible approach could be to establish a joint monitoring mechanism between Israel and Palestinian authorities to oversee the cease-fire agreement. This could involve setting up checkpoints, deploying observers, and sharing intelligence to prevent any violations.\n\nAdditionally, it may be helpful to address the underlying issues that led to the conflict in the first place. This could involve negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leaders to address issues such as settlements, borders, and the status of Jerusalem. By addressing these core issues, a lasting peace can be achieved, and the need for military operations in the West Bank can be minimized.\n\nIn summary, extending the cease-fire to the West Bank while ensuring its proper enforcement in Gaza requires a multi-faceted approach that involves a joint monitoring mechanism, addressing underlying issues, and negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leaders."}
