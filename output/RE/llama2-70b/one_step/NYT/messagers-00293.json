The paragraph mentions that Toyota has plants in Ontario, Canada. Therefore, we can establish a hierarchical relationship between Canada and Ontario, where Canada is the broader location and Ontario is the specific location.\n2. The paragraph also mentions that Toyota has plants in Indiana and Kentucky. Since both Indiana and Kentucky are states in the United States, we can establish a hierarchical relationship between the United States and Indiana and Kentucky, where the United States is the broader location and Indiana and Kentucky are specific locations.\n3. The paragraph also mentions that Toyota recently opened a plant in San Antonio. San Antonio is a city in Texas, which is a state in the United States. Therefore, we can establish a hierarchical relationship between the United States and San Antonio, where the United States is the broader location and San Antonio is the specific location.\n4. Since Canada and the United States are both located in North America, we can establish a hierarchical relationship between North America and Canada and the United States, where North America is the broader location and Canada and the United States are specific locations.\n\nNote that the relationships established above are based on the context of the paragraph and the locations mentioned therein. In general, hierarchical relationships between locations can vary depending on the context and the level of detail used to describe the locations."}
