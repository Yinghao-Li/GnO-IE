The leader of Hamas is Ismail Haniyeh, who was born in Shati Camp, Gaza City, Gaza.\n\nTherefore, we can create a table with the following information:\n\n| Person | Birth Place | Whether the Person was born in the Birth Place |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Naftali Bennett | Haifa, Israel | Yes |\n| Ismail Haniyeh | Shati Camp, Gaza City, Gaza | Yes |\n\nPlease note that this information is not present in the given paragraph, but it can be obtained from other sources."}
