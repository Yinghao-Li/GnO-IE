The phrase \"going from France to Corsica\" implies that the speaker has traveled from one location to the other, which suggests that they have spent time in both places. Additionally, the speaker's use of \"I was\" in the sentence \"I was at the top of a giant boat at 2 in the morning\" suggests that they have personal experience being in that location at that time, which further implies residency."}
