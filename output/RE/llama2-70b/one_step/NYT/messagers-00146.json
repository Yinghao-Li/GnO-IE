Therefore, Lucia is their coach, and they are his players, which means he has them.\n* Kellen Briggs is also a player on the team, but he is from Colorado Springs, whereas Lucia is from Minnesota. Therefore, Lucia does not have Kellen Briggs as his player.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}
