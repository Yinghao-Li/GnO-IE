Biden Jr. from Delaware, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich from Ohio, and Gov. Tom Vilsack from Iowa.\n\nOhio and Iowa are both states in the United States, while Delaware is also a state but smaller than Ohio and Iowa. Therefore, the broader location in this context would be Ohio and Iowa, and the specific locations would be Representative Dennis J. Kucinich and Gov. Tom Vilsack, respectively. Delaware is also a broader location that contains Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nSo, the relationships between the locations can be represented in the table above. The Broader Location column lists the states (Ohio, Iowa, and Delaware), while the Specific Location column lists the political figures associated with those states (Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Gov. Tom Vilsack, and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.). The last column indicates whether the broader location contains the specific location, which is yes in all three cases."}
