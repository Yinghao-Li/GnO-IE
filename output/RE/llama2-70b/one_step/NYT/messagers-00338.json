Here's a table of the nationalities of the people mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n| Person | Nationality | Whether the Person has the Nationality |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Juliet B. Schor | American | Yes |\n\nThe only person mentioned in the paragraph is Juliet B. Schor, who is described as a professor of sociology at Boston College and the author of a book. Since she is a professor at a university in the United States and has written a book published by a U.S.-based publisher (Scribner), it is likely that she is American. Therefore, the table above shows her nationality as \"American\" and indicates that she has that nationality."}

Boston is a city in Massachusetts, and Boston College is a university located within the city. Therefore, Boston is the broader location, and Boston College is the specific location. Boston encompasses Boston College.\n2. Scribner is a publishing company, and it is not a physical location. It cannot be considered a specific location in the context of the paragraph.
