Therefore, Hanoi is a specific location within Asia.\n* Seoul is a city in South Korea, which is also a country in Asia. Therefore, Seoul is a specific location within Asia.\n* Since both Hanoi and Seoul are located in Asia, Asia is the broader location that encompasses both cities.\n* Hanoi does not contain Seoul, as Seoul is a separate city in a different country.\n\nI hope this helps!
