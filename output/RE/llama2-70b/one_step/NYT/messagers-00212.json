Therefore, the relationship between NHPF and Baton Rouge is not \"Person B died in Location A.\"\n* Individual B is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph, so we cannot determine their relationship with Baton Rouge.\n\nNote that the paragraph only mentions Baton Rouge in the context of NHPF's office location and does not provide any information about Individual B's whereabouts or death.
