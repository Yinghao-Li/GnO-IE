Since Britain is mentioned first, we can assume that Imperial was born in Britain.\n\nAltadis, on the other hand, is mentioned as having significant market share in Spain and France. This does not necessarily mean that the company was born in either of those countries, but it does suggest a connection to those regions. Therefore, we can list Spain and France as the birth places for Altadis, but with a \"No\" in the third column to indicate that the company was not born in either of those countries."}
