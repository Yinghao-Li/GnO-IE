Therefore, we can infer that Sirhan is associated with Israel.\n2. \"I had come from Israel\" - This sentence indicates that the speaker, Markman, had come from Israel. Therefore, we can infer that Markman is also associated with Israel.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that there are two \"Location A is located in Location B\" relationships:\n\n1. Israel is located in Sirhan (as Sirhan's motivation for killing Kennedy was related to his feelings towards Israel).\n2. Israel is located in I (as the speaker, Markman, had come from Israel)."}
