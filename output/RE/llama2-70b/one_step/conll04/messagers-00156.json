The paragraph mentions that the Australian Government is considering inviting a senior North Korean Government official to visit Australia. This implies that Australia is a separate location from North Korea, and that the official would be visiting Australia from North Korea. Therefore, we can infer that Australia is not located in North Korea.\n2. The paragraph does not mention anything about North Korea being located in Australia, so we can infer that North Korea is not located in Australia.\n\nNote that the relationships inferred from the paragraph are negative, i.e., we know that certain locations are not located in each other. This is because the paragraph does not provide explicit information about locations being situated within each other."}

This implies that the official has not lived in Australia before, as they would not need to be invited to visit if they already resided there.\n* The paragraph does not explicitly state that the official resides in North Korea, but it is implied as they are referred to as a \"North Korean Government official\"."}
