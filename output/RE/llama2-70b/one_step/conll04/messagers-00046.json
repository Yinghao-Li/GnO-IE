Beijing is located in China, so that is a valid \"Location A is located in Location B\" relationship. Cambodia, on the other hand, is not located in Vietnam, so there is no valid relationship between the two.\n\nHere's the Markdown table summarizing the analysis:\n\n| Specific Location | Broader Location | Whether the Specific Location is located in the Broader Location |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Beijing | China | Yes |\n| Cambodia | Vietnam | No |\n\nI hope this helps!
