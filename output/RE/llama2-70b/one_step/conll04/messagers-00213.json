Kennedy, implying that Oswald was present in Dallas, Texas, where the assassination took place. Therefore, a row is added to the table with \"Lee Harvey Oswald\" in the \"Person\" column, \"Dallas, Texas\" in the \"Location\" column, and \"Yes\" in the \"Whether the Person has lived in the Location\" column.\n* President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, but the paragraph does not imply or state that he resided there. Therefore, a row is added to the table with \"President John F. Kennedy\" in the \"Person\" column, \"Dallas, Texas\" in the \"Location\" column, and \"No\" in the \"Whether the Person has lived in the Location\" column."}
