It also states that John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, indicating that he did not reside there but was present on the day of his assassination. The Warren Commission and House Assassinations Committee are organizations, so they do not reside in any location. However, the paragraph mentions that the Warren Commission held a belief about Lee Harvey Oswald's role in Dallas, and the House Assassinations Committee concluded its findings in 1978, but does not imply that they resided in any specific location."}
