Therefore, the relationship between the organization and the location is not applicable (\"N/A\").\n* Turkey is a country, not an organization, and therefore does not have a direct relationship with the location Berlin or the Federal Republic."}

Here's the relationship in a Markdown table:\n\n| Killer | Victim | Whether the Killer kills the Victim |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Federal Administrative Court in Berlin | Kurds in the Federal Republic | No |\n\nThe Federal Administrative Court in Berlin does not kill the Kurds in the Federal Republic. Instead, the court's verdict denies Kurds the ability to claim asylum if they have no safe haven in Turkey, which means the Kurds are not killed but rather denied asylum. Therefore, this relationship does not fit the \"Killer kills the Victim\" category."}
