The author mentions that the television antenna is on the roof, but it is not working properly. The author then suggests that the problem might be caused by a \"killer\" who is blocking the signal, and that the \"victim\" is the television program that the author is trying to watch.\n\nBased on this interpretation, the \"Killer\" would be the entity or object that is blocking the television signal, and the \"Victim\" would be the television program that is being affected by the signal loss.\n\nHere's a table summarizing this interpretation:\n\n| Killer | Victim | Whether the Killer kills the Victim |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| The entity or object blocking the television signal | The television program the author is trying to watch | Yes, the killer (signal blocker) is preventing the victim (television program) from being received properly |"}
