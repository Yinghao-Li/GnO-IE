This means that Khrushchev was willing to defy Kennedy's orders and potentially put the two nations on a collision course. However, the order was reversed just hours before an inevitable confrontation, indicating that Khrushchev did not ultimately follow through with his initial instructions and a confrontation was avoided. Therefore, the relationship between Khrushchev and Kennedy is not \"Killer kills the Victim\" in this context."}
