The reference to \"the commission\" in the quote from Robert Bernero suggests that NRC may be a regulatory agency, but it does not provide enough information to determine its location. Similarly, the mention of \"the department\" in the reference to DOE does not provide enough information to determine its location. Therefore, the table above shows that there are no valid relationships that can be identified based on the given text."}

Therefore, there is a valid relationship between Robert Bernero and NRC, where Bernero works for NRC.\n* The paragraph also mentions the Department of Energy (DOE), but it does not indicate that Robert Bernero works for DOE. Therefore, there is no valid relationship between Bernero and DOE."}
