This implies that the Soviet diplomatic corps is based in Moscow, which is a specific location. Therefore, a relationship exists between the Soviet diplomatic corps and Moscow, where the organization is headquartered or primarily operates."}

This relationship can be inferred from the sentence \"Alekseev, along with others in the Soviet diplomatic corps.\"\n\nNote that the paragraph does not explicitly mention the location of the Soviet diplomatic corps, so we cannot infer a specific location for it. However, we can infer that Alekseev is a member of the Soviet diplomatic corps, which is a broader entity that includes multiple individuals, including Alekseev."}
