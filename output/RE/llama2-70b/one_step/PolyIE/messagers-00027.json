Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Another pleasant surprise comes from PCDSeBT with a relative wider absorption band observed , as a result of strong intermolecular Se°°°Se interactions. The lower bandgap with the broaden absorption band significantly improves a J SC of 11.7 mA / cm^2 , which is among the highest J SC values for PSCs based on PCDTBT derivatives , while the low HOMO energy level maintains the high V OC value. The corresponding PCE is 4.12% , about 37% higher than that obtained from a PCDTBT - based reference device. This work provides a feasible strategy for selective fine - tuning of LUMO levels , which achieves a high J SC value , while nearly remaining a high V OC . Therefore , further exploration of PCDSeBT - based PSCs is still warranted for high - performance PCEs by means of controlling the film morphology and improving electric contacts .\n\nLet's think step by step."},

The properties mentioned are:\n\n* Bandgap: PCDSeBT has a relative wider absorption band, which is attributed to strong intermolecular Se°°°Se interactions.\n* HOMO energy level: PCDSeBT has a low HOMO energy level, which helps maintain a high V OC value.\n* J SC: PCDSeBT has a high J SC value of 11.7 mA/cm^2, which is among the highest J SC values for PSCs based on PCDTBT derivatives.\n* V OC: PCDSeBT maintains a high V OC value, similar to that of PCDTBT.\n* PCE: PCDSeBT has a PCE of 4.12%, which is about 37% higher than that obtained from a PCDTBT-based reference device.\n\nThe paragraph also mentions that the low HOMO energy level and high J SC value of PCDSeBT achieve a high PCE while nearly remaining a high V OC, and that further exploration of PCDSeBT-based PSCs is warranted for high-performance PCEs by controlling the film morphology and improving electric contacts."}
