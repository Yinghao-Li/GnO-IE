Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: By taking into consideration using low bandgap polymers to harvest more solar photons , researchers have devoted much effort recently to reducing the bandgap of polymers. This approach has provided a remarkable short - circuit current density ( J SC ) of 16 mA / cm^2 , 3 whereas , in general , the V OC has suffered 4 because of a higher than the HOMO optimal energy level in order to pursue a lower bandgap. In the PSCs community , poly(2,7-carbazole-altdithienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDTBT ) is one excellent exam - ple for a low HOMO ( -5.45 eV ) as required by the ' ideal ' πconjugated polymers , which led to a high V OC value over 0.8 V and outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures. 5 The initial PCE reached 3.6% 6 in a typical BHJ device and has been subsequently improved to exceeding 6% by BHJ layer thickness optimization and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures. 7 However , the bandgap of PCDTBT is still relatively larger than the proposed 1.5 - 1.7 eV of the ideal polymers for PCEs exceeding 10% . Recently , to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT without sacrificing its high V OC , Hsu et al. 8 and our group 9 independently reported PCDTBT - based ladder - type polymers with forced planarity of which device performance showed impressive PCEs of up to 4.59% with reduced bandgap ( ca. 0.2 eV ) in comparison with that of PCDTBT. However , the multiple synthetic steps for the ladder - type PCDTBTs have restricted the realization for their usage in BHJ devices. Herein , we present an easily obtainable selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-diselenienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDSeBT ) by replacing thiophenes with selenophene rings in the polymer backbone. Such a structural modification would be expected the lower - lying LUMO with the HOMO being largely unaffected due to the individual effects of the smaller ionization potential ( IP ) and almost the same electronegativity of selenium relative to sulfur atom. 10 In addition , interchain - charge transfer should be facilitated by intermolecular Se°°°Se contacts , most likely leading to a widen absorption band and enhanced mobility that are desirable for high photocurrents. 11 Our preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic properties of PCDSeBT in typical BHJ devices with [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) shows a highly respectrable PCE of 4.12% on account of the high J SC and V OC . The synthetic routes to the monomers ( M1 and M2 ) and PCDSeBT are shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were synthesized according to the previously reported procedures. 5a,12 The diboronic ester monomer M1 was easily synthesized from precursor 3 , by dilithiation at -78 °C , followed by quenching with 2-iso-propoxy-4,4,5,5-tetrametyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane in anhydrous THF in a yield of 79% .\n\nLet's think step by step."},
