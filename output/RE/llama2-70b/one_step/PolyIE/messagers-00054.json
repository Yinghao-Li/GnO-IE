Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Because the lamellar spacing in P1 ( 19.2 Å ) was smaller than in P7 ( 24.1 Å ) , the length of the side chains in BDTT is not the main factor in determining the lamellar spacing in P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 ; the lamellar spacing is mainly determined by the length of the side chains in DPP and TPD. As more TPD was introduced into the polymer backbone , the domain spacing of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 gradually increased from 19.2 , 20.1 , 21.9 , 22.7 to 24.1 Å , respectively. This is likely due to the increased amount of structurally longer alkyl side chains of TPD. Figure S8 shows that the pristine polymers exhibited a distinctive arc scattering of the ( 010 ) peak along the out - of - plane direction at q = 1.62- 1.68 Å -1 , corresponding to π-π stacking. The π-π stacking is more prominent in the out - of - plane direction , which suggests that most of the polymer backbones are oriented parallel to the substrates. The π-π stacking distances of polymers were 3.85 , 3.86 , 3.84 , 3.85 , and 3.74 Å for P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 , respectively. The combination effects of the DPP to TPD ratio with changes in the alkyl chain could affect the π-π stacking distance of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 and backbone planarity , thus influencing their charge transport properties. The π-π stacking feature of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 in the blended films was significantly changed by the addition of PCBM , as shown in Figure 6. No π-π stacking diffraction was observed in P1 , P3 , and P4 , and only a faint π-π stacking diffraction pattern in the out - of - plane direction appeared for P5. However , P7 had a prominent π-π stacking peak even after the addition of PCBM , indicating that the polymer backbone adopts a preferential \" face-on \" orientation relative to the substrate. In spite of the \" face-on \" orientation of P7 , its mobility was observed to be slightly lower compared to the other polymers , which is most likely due to the presence of fewer percolating pathways for hole transport. 54 Therefore , the GIXS patterns revealed that the incorporation of the different units of DPP and TPD affects the polymeric ordering ( i.e. , domain spacing ) as well as its direction. For further characterization , the BHJ morphology of the polymer blends was investigated by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ). The resulting AFM and TEM images are shown in Figure 7 and Figure S9 , respectively. The images of P1 , P3 , P4 , and P5 blends showed bicontinuous structures of polymer and PCBM as well as small - scale phase separation favorable for exciton dissociation.\n\nLet's think step by step."},

The lamellar spacings of P1, P3, P4, and P5 are 19.2 Å, 20.1 Å, 21.9 Å, and 22.7 Å, respectively, while the lamellar spacing of P7 is 24.1 Å. The π-π stacking distances of P1, P3, P4, P5, and P7 are 3.85 Å, 3.86 Å, 3.84 Å, 3.85 Å, and 3.74 Å, respectively. The paragraph also mentions the presence of PCBM, a material with a \"face-on\" orientation relative to the substrate, which affects the mobility of the polymers.\n\nThe relationships between the materials and their properties can be summarized as follows:\n\n* The lamellar spacing of the polymers (P1, P3, P4, P5, and P7) increases with the increase in the amount of TPD in the polymer backbone.\n* The π-π stacking distance of the polymers (P1, P3, P4, P5, and P7) is affected by the DPP to TPD ratio and the alkyl chain length.\n* The presence of PCBM affects the π-π stacking feature of the polymers (P1, P3, P4, P5, and P7) and their charge transport properties.\n* The BHJ morphology of the polymer blends was investigated by AFM and TEM, showing bicontinuous structures of polymer and PCBM as well as small-scale phase separation favorable for exciton dissociation."}
