Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 36 OPVs based on blends of benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene copolymers and PC61BM exhibited PCEs as high as 2.17% . 37-40 In this paper , we report creation of a new fused - ring building block dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 8 , Figure 2 ) and its application in design and synthesis of conjugated polymers. The combination of benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene planarity and efficient π-π stacking with the electron - withdrawing capacity of the imide functionality serves as the foundation for this new class of materials. Introduction of the π-electron - deficient imide moiety can decrease the HOMO and LUMO energies of the polymers , which is necessary for air - stable polymers. Furthermore , substitution at the imide nitrogen allows introduction of functionalities and solubility improvement with varying degrees of steric bulk while not impinging on critical intermolecular π-π stacking characteristics. This motif also leaves the benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene 2-and 7-positions available for polymerization. Finally , the dipole moment caused by the imide could stabilize cofacial antiparallel intra-and interchain repeat unit orientations , planarize the backbone , and promote π-π stacking. 27 On the basis of this new building block , we designed and synthesized a series of conjugated copolymers : unit 8 coupled with electron - rich unit benzo[1,2b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene ( P1 and P2 ) or with electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole ( P3 and P4 ) or benzo [c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( P5 ) and homopolymer ( P6 ) ( Figure 2 ). The optical properties and electronic structure ( HOMO / LUMO levels and bandgap ) can be manipulated through adjusting copolymerized building blocks. ' RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization. The synthetic routes to the monomers and polymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. We chose very cheap , industrial product maleic anhydride as a starting material. Bromination of maleic anhydride with Br 2 gave its dibromide ( 1 ). 41 Then , amination with alkylamine afforded the alkyl-substituted 3,4dibromopyrrole-2,5-dione ( 2a,b ). Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide 2a,b with 3-thienylboronic acid gave 3,4-bis(3-thienyl)pyrrole-2,5-dione ( 3a,b ). The large sulfur - containing polycyclic aromatic imides , dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 4a,b ) , were synthesized through iron(III) chloride - mediated oxidative cyclization , which is a general strategy for ring closure. 42 Bromination of 4a , b with Br 2 gave rise to the monomers 5a,b. Stille coupling reaction of 5a with tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane afforded 2,7-bis(2-thienyl)-dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 6a ) , which was brominated with NBS to afford monomer 7a. Copolymers P1-P4 were synthesized through Stille coupling reaction of the dibromide monomers 5a,b or 7a with benzodithiophene-2,6-ditin or 2,2 0 -bithiazole-5,5 0 -ditin , while P5 was synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide monomer 5b with benzothiadiazole-4,7-diboronic ester. Homopolymer P6 was synthesized by palladium - catalyzed homocoupling of the dibromide 5b in the presence of hexabutylditin. P1 with three solubilizing n-dodecyl groups has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , THF , and toluene.\n\nLet's think step by step."},

The condition column lists the type of copolymer or homopolymer and the monomers used to synthesize it.\n\nThe paragraph also mentions the synthesis of the monomers and polymers, which involves several steps and reactions, including bromination, amination, Suzuki coupling, and Stille coupling. The starting material for the synthesis is maleic anhydride, which is converted to the dibromide monomers 5a,b through several steps. The dibromide monomers are then copolymerized with other monomers, such as benzodithiophene-2,6-ditin or 2,2 0 -bithiazole-5,5 0 -ditin, to form the copolymers P1-P4. The homopolymer P6 is synthesized through palladium-catalyzed homocoupling of the dibromide 5b in the presence of hexabutylditin."}
