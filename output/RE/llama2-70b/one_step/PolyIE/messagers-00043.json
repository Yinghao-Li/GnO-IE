Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: To investigate the morphology of the polymer / PCBM blend film , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was performed , and the result is shown in Figure 6. In Figure 6a , microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM , while the polymer formed a small fibril - type domain at a 1 : 1 PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio. As shown in Figure 6c , the fibril domain or microphase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size. It appears that this type of fibril domain occurred because PQCDTB formed effective π-π stacking based on outstanding crystallinity. 31 As shown in Figure 6b , in contrast , when the PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio was 1 : 2 , the polymers were assembled , and a large domain was formed. As a result , a relatively large - size phase separation took place. As shown in Figure 6d , the large domain or the large - size phase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size. The large - phase separation exhibits a low photocurrent by reducing the charge separation and increasing the exciton diffusion length and the recombination of electric charges. 32 Therefore , at a 1 : 2 polymer / PC71BM ratio , a large phase separation occurs between the polymer and the PC71BM. As a result , a low photocurrent would occur ; this is comparable to the 1 : 1 ratio. The same results were confirmed for the current device using the data in Table 3. Similar results were observed between PQCDTB and PC61BM as well. When the PCZDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 4 , a smooth morphology was detected , and no fibril domain was observed , just like the PQCDTB , because the self - organization of PCZDTB is lower than that of PQCDTB. 9 In this study , PQCDTB has been successfully synthesized through the Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing planar quinacridone unit and a broad - absorption benzothiadiazole unit. PQCDTB had a high molecular weight and good thermal stability. Because of the appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels , an effective balance was produced. According to the X-ray diffraction measurement , a broad diffraction peak was observed at approximately 24.0 ° . In terms of the π-π stacking distance ( d π ) , a significantly shorter distance ( 3.7 Å ) was observed. These values were similar to the results of the thiophene and thiophenefused aromatic system polymers. When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the highest efficiency was detected , and V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8% , and 2.5% , respectively. When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the polymer formed a fibril - type domain and microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM. Because of selforganization , PQCDTB showed a higher FF compared with PCZDTB.\n\nLet's think step by step."},

The first column lists the material name, while the second column lists the material property. The third column provides an abbreviation for the material property, and the fourth column gives the numerical value. The fifth column specifies the condition under which the property was observed or measured.\n\nThe table shows that PQCDTB has a high molecular weight, good thermal stability, appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and a short π-π stacking distance (dπ). It also exhibits a broad X-ray diffraction peak. PC71BM and PC61BM are mentioned, but their properties are not explicitly stated.\n\nThe table also shows that the PQCDTB:PC71BM ratio affects the morphology, photocurrent, large phase separation, charge separation, exciton diffusion length, and recombination of electric charges. At a ratio of 1:1, a fibril-type domain and microphase separation occur, resulting in a high efficiency, VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE. At a ratio of 1:2, a large phase separation occurs, leading to a low photocurrent. At a ratio of 1:4, a smooth morphology is observed, and no fibril domain is detected.\n\nOverall, the table summarizes the main findings and properties of the materials discussed in the paragraph."}
