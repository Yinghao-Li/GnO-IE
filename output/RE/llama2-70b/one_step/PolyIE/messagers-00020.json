Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: In an attempt to further improve the performance of the PCDTBT - based polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , we have synthesized a selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , PCDSeBT , in which diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ( DSeBT ) monomer alternately flanks with a 2,7-carbazole unit. The intrinsic properties of PCDSeBT are not only characterized by UV - vis absorption , cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) , and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) but also the surface morphology , mobilities of space charge - limited current ( SCLC ) model , and polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) in its bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) active layer with [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) are evaluated in detail. It is found that PCDSeBT simultaneously has a low - lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level at -5.4 eV and a low bandgap of 1.70 eV as required by the ideal polymers for BHJ PSCs. The high current of 11.7 mA / cm^2 is obtained for PCDSeBT - based PSCs , to our knowledge , which is among the highest short - circuit current density ( J SC ) values obtained from a BHJ device consisting of PCDTBT derivatives and [6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ). The high J SC value , along with a moderate fill factor ( FF ) of 45% and a high open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.79 V , yields a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 4.12% , which is about 37% increase in PCE from a PCDTBT - based reference device. On the basis of our results , one can be concluded that the DSeBT placement for construction of donor (D)-acceptor ( A ) polymers is an easy and effective way to realize both the higher J SC and V OC values in PSCs , as a consequence of the selective lower - lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) with the HOMO being almost unchanged , together with the effective broadening on the absorption band . With deep understanding of efficient photoinduced electron transfer within an interpenetrating network by simple blending π-conjugated polymers ( electron donor ) with fullerene derivatives ( electron acceptor ) , 1 bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) : [6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) have been extensively investigated , leading to great progress in power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of 4-5 % . 2 Yet , the PCE of P3HT - based PSCs is limited by its relatively large bandgap ( ∼ 1.9 eV ) with major loss of the solar radiation as well as low open circuit - voltage ( V OC ≅ 0.6 V ) due to the relatively small energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of P3HT and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of PCBM.\n\nLet's think step by step."},

The intrinsic properties of PCDSeBT are characterized using various methods, including UV-vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). The surface morphology, mobilities of space charge-limited current (SCLC) model, and polymer solar cells (PSCs) in its bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are also evaluated.\n\nThe paragraph also compares the performance of PCDSeBT-based PSCs with that of PCDTBT-based PSCs and mentions the limitations of P3HT-based PSCs. The high current of 11.7 mA/cm^2 and high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.79 V obtained for PCDSeBT-based PSCs are noted, which result in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.12%, a 37% increase from a PCDTBT-based reference device. The paragraph suggests that the DSeBT placement for construction of donor (D)-acceptor (A) polymers is an effective way to realize both higher JSC and VOC values in PSCs, due to the selective lower-lying LUMO with the HOMO being almost unchanged, together with the effective broadening on the absorption band.\n\nThe paragraph also mentions that the PCE of P3HT-based PSCs is limited by its relatively large bandgap (∼ 1.9 eV) with major loss of the solar radiation as well as low open-circuit voltage (VOC ≅ 0.6 V) due to the relatively small energy difference between the HOMO of P3HT and the LUMO of PCBM."}
