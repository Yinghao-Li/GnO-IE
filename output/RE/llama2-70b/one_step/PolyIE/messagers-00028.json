Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: their ter-polymers containing perylene units were synthesized using Suzuki coupling polymerization. The perylene units were introduced to improve the charge - transport ability by enhancing the π-π interaction between polymer chains. The resulting polymers were characterized by 1H NMR , elemental analysis , DSC , and TGA. The synthesized polymers were soluble in common organic solvents , and formed smooth and uniform spin - coated thin films. All of the polymers studied were found to exhibit good thermal stability , losing less than 5% of their weight upon heating to approximately 350 ° C. Perylene-containing polymers showed higher field - effect mobilities than the corresponding PFDTBT or PFD2TBT polymers because of the enhanced π-π interaction between polymer chains upon the introduction of perylene units. Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al. The devices using the perylene-containing polymers showed higher short - circuit currents , and fill factors than the corresponding PFDTBT or PFD2TBT devices. One of the fabricated devices using a perylene-containing copolymer showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.16% , with a short circuit current density of 9.61 mA / cm^2 , open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , and fill factor of 41% . Extensive research has been carried out during the past decade on bulk heterojunction solar cells that utilize organic semiconducting materials. 1 The main advantages of organic photovoltaic devices ( OPVs ) are their lightweight , flexible nature , and their cost - effective manufacture by various printing technologies. The photoconversion process in OPVs is accomplished by efficient light absorption by conjugated polymers and accepting materials , charge separation at the interface of the donor polymer and the accepting materials , and subsequent charge collection at the electrodes. Matching the absorption of the conjugated polymer to the solar spectrum determines the ultimate performance of the solar cell. Among the variety of conjugated polymers that have been studied , poly(p-phenylenevinylene) ( PPV ) , 2 poly(alkylfluorene) ( PF ) , and polythiophene ( PT ) 3 derivatives are typical p - type electron donor materials. However , the performance of photovoltaic cells with these polymers is limited by their relatively large band gap energies , which are not yet optimized with respect to the solar spectrum. Therefore , the design and synthesis of new low - band gap polymers become very important to better harvest the solar spectrum , especially in the red and near - infrared ranges , which can lead to possible enhancements in the photocurrents of OPVs. 4 The most widely used approach for obtaining low - band gap structures is to utilize internal charge transfer ( ICT ) from an electron - donating to an electron - accepting moiety. 5-7 Some interesting structures using the ICT approach have been reported.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
