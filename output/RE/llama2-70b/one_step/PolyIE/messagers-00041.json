Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: For the film , the maxima absorption spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were red - shifted by 9-23 nm compared with the solution. These results are explained by their much more planar conformations in the solid state. 10 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram of PCZDTB and PQCDTB , which were measured in 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate acetonitrile. As reported by Lidzey et al. , the PCZDTB oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potential were + 1.09 and -1.37 V , respectively , and the HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.44 and -2.98 eV. In the case of PQCDTB , unlike the PQA2T ( poly[quinacridone-bithiophene] ) reported by Takimiya et al. , a clear oxidation - reduction peak was observed. 19 This type of result has been obtained because PQCDTB was D-A structured , unlike the typical p - type structure of PQA2T. In PQCDTB , the oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potentials were + 0.89 and -1.36 V , respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.24 and -2.99 eV , respectively. Table 2 summarizes the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers. As shown in Table 2 , the HOMO level of PQCDTB ( -5.24 eV ) was higher than that of PCZDTB by 0.2 eV because the HOMO level of the QC derivative was higher than that of carbazole. The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference between the HOMO energy levels and the optical bandgap energies. According to the calculations , the LUMO levels of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were -3.32 and -3.46 eV , respectively. They slightly differed from the levels calculated through CV , but they mostly exhibited a similar tendency. Figure 4 shows the band diagram of the energy levels that have been obtained through DFT calculations and experiments. The bandgap energies of PQCDTB and PCZDTB determined through UV - vis spectra were reported as 1.98 and 1.92 eV , respectively , which were lower than the results of the DFT calculation by 0.57 and 0.55 V. 28 Because the HOMO level is lower than the P3HT HOMO level ( -4.9 eV ) in both polymers , a relatively high air stability could be obtained. 29 In the case of PQCDTB , the LUMO level ( -3.32 eV ) was higher than the PC71BM LUMO level ( -4.0 eV ) by 0.68 eV. However , the HOMO level ( -5.24 eV ) was lower than the PEDOT : PSS HOMO level ( -5.0 eV ) by 0.24 eV. Therefore , if charge separation occurs after receiving light energy , a hole would exhibit more effective charge transport than an electron in the active layer of PQCDTB. 14,26 Figure 5 and Table 3 show the results of evaluating the characteristics of an OPV device.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paragraph discusses the properties of two materials, PQCDTB and PCZDTB, and their potential for use in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The following table summarizes the properties of the materials:\n\n| Material Name | Material Property | Material Property (Abbr.) | Numerical Value | Condition |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PQCDTB | HOMO level | -5.24 eV | - | - |\n| PQCDTB | LUMO level | -3.32 eV | - | - |\n| PCZDTB | HOMO level | -5.44 eV | - | - |\n| PCZDTB | LUMO level | -3.46 eV | - | - |\n| PQCDTB | Oxidation onset potential | +0.89 V | - | - |\n| PQCDTB | Reduction onset potential | -1.36 V | - | - |\n| PCZDTB | Oxidation onset potential | +1.09 V | - | - |\n| PCZDTB | Reduction onset potential | -1.37 V | - | - |\n| PQCDTB | Bandgap energy | 1.98 eV | - | - |\n| PCZDTB | Bandgap energy | 1.92 eV | - | - |\n\nThe table shows that PQCDTB has a higher HOMO level and a lower LUMO level than PCZDTB. The oxidation and reduction onset potentials of PQCDTB are also different from those of PCZDTB. The bandgap energies of both materials were determined through UV-vis spectra and were found to be lower than the results of DFT calculations.\n\nThe paragraph also mentions that the HOMO level of PQCDTB is higher than that of PCZDTB, which means that PQCDTB has a higher electron affinity. This, combined with the fact that the LUMO level of PQCDTB is higher than that of PC71BM, suggests that PQCDTB has a higher electron transport ability than PCZDTB. However, the HOMO level of PQCDTB is lower than the HOMO level of PEDOT:PSS, which means that PQCDTB has a lower hole transport ability than PEDOT:PSS.\n\nOverall, the properties of PQCDTB and PCZDTB suggest that they have potential for use in OPV devices, with PQCDTB possibly exhibiting better electron transport properties than PCZDTB."}
