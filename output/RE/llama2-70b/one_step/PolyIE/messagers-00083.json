In conclusion , a highly effective photovoltaic polymer with NIR response , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) , based on alternating 3,6-dithien-2-yl-2 , 5-dibutylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione units has been synthesized. PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) has high hole mobility ( 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) and broad photocurrent response wavelengths from 300 nm to 1.1 μm. The photovoltaic properties of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) were preliminarily investigated , and high shortcircuit current ( 14.87 mA / cm^2 ) and PCE ( 2.71% ) were achieved. Considering the sufficiently high I SC values of this system , more promising photovoltaic performance is thought to be achievable by using other fullerene derivatives with high LUMO energy levels , such as bis-PCBM 13 or Lu3N @ C80 - PCBH. 14 Further device optimization and the synthesis of new μmRpolymers are currently in progress and will be reported in due course.
