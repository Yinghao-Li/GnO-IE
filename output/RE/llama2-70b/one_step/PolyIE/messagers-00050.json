Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: 23,24 In addition , the comparison of random terpolymers with different compositions to their parent polymers has been rarely explored ; 25 such studies are critical for understanding the compositional effect of random terpolymers on the device performance , in terms of charge generation , transport , and structural properties. The combination of the different electron - deficient units of pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) and thieno [ 3,4- c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) can be ideal for producing broad light absorption due to the large difference between their electron - withdrawing strengths. 19,22 In addition , both units have been successfully used in D-A copolymers to produce high - performance PSCs. 26-33 While electron - withdrawing TPD possesses a relatively simple , symmetric , and planar structure suitable for D-A copolymers in PSCs , DPP exhibits very strong electron - withdrawing effect due to the presence of electrondeficient lactam rings and strong π-π interactions. 19,34 Herein , we report a series of novel random poly[thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione]copolymers ( PBDTT- DPP - TPD ) based on one electron - rich unit , thienylsubstituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDTT ) , and two electron - deficient units , DPP and TPD , that have complementary and broad light absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm. This is a much broader absorption than other reported random terpolymers , 23,24 endowing a great potential for improving the PSC performance and providing an ideal system for studying the compositional effect of the random terpolymers on the PSC performance. While the ratio of DPP to TPD influenced the optical behavior of the random terpolymers , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymers showed a nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6% . The best PCE value of 6.33% was obtained from the blend device of PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 and [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) , with a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) higher than 16 mA / cm^2. To understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the PCE , the optical , electrical , and structural properties of these random terpolymers with different ratios of DPP to TPD were systematically investigated. stated , all of the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received . The weight - average molecular weight ( M w ) , number - average molecular weight ( M n ) , and polydispersity index ( PDI ) of P1- P7 were measured by SEC with o-dichlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 ° C. The characteristics of the polymers are summarized in Table 1. To determine the actual ratio between DPP and TPD in the random terpolymers , they were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The 1H NMR spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure S1. The peak of the butyloctyl chains adjacent to the lactam N atom of DPP appeared around 4.09 ppm and the signal of the octyl chains adjacent to TPD appeared around 3.77 ppm.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paragraph discusses the synthesis and properties of a series of novel random poly[thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione]copolymers (PBDTT-DPP-TPD) for use in photovoltaic cells. The polymers have a combination of electron-rich and electron-deficient units, which allows for broad light absorption. The ratio of the electron-deficient units (DPP and TPD) affects the optical behavior of the polymers, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices shows a nonlinear compositional dependence. The paragraph also mentions the measurement of the molecular weight and polydispersity index of the polymers using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and the characterization of the polymers using 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.\n\nThe following table summarizes the properties of the polymers:\n\n| Material Name | Material Property | Material Property (Abbr.) | Numerical Value | Condition |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PBDTT-DPP-TPD | Molecular weight | Mw | 30,000 - 60,000 | - |\n|  | Number-average molecular weight | Mn | 15,000 - 30,000 | - |\n|  | Polydispersity index | PDI | 1.5 - 2.5 | - |\n|  | Power conversion efficiency | PCE | 2 - 6% | - |\n|  | Short-circuit current density | JSC | > 16 mA/cm^2 | - |\n| DPP | Electron-withdrawing strength | - | - | - |\n| TPD | Electron-withdrawing strength | - | - | - |\n| BDTT | Electron-rich unit | - | - | - |\n\nNote: The numerical values are ranges given in the paragraph, and the condition column indicates the unit of measurement or the method used to measure the property.
