Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: The performance of PSCs was insensitive to the ratio of donor to acceptor in range of 1 : 2.5 to 1 : 4. With a weight ratio of PSFDTBT to PC71BM is 1 : 3.5 , a PCE of 4.2% with a V oc of 0.96 V , a J sc of 7.6 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.56 was achieved under illumination from an AM 1.5G solar simulator ( 100 mW cm^-2 ). Such high V oc of almost 1 V is consistent with the low - lying HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT. In comparison with the device performance of P1 based PSCs , 8 devices based on PSFDTBT exhibited almost identical V oc , but higher J sc and much higher FF. As shown in Table 1 , the optimized devices based on P1 showed a PCE of 3.1% with a V oc of 0.97 V , a J sc of 6.7 mA / cm^2 , and an FF = 0.47. It is well - known that the processing solvent can dramatically affect the morphology of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance of devices. When the solvent was changed from DCB to TCB , the photovoltaic performance could be further improved. As shown in Table 1 , when the active layer was PSFDTBT / PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1 : 3 , the highest PCE of 4.6% with a V oc of 0.94 V , a J sc of 8.0 mA / cm , and an FF of 0.60 was achieved. J-V curves of polymer solar cells fabricated with different weight ratio of PSFDTBT : PC71BM in TCB solutions are shown in Figure 3b. It is worth noting that such performance was achieved from simply fabricated devices without using any additive , posttreatment , or extra layers , which is beneficial for preparation of low cost polymer solar cells. To verify the accuracy of the J sc measurement results , external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) of solar cells were measured under illumination of monochromatic light. As shown in Figure 4 , solar cells , which were fabricated from PSFDTBT : PC71BM in a ratio of 1 : 3.5 ( w / w ) in DCB solutions and PSFDTBT : PC71BM in a ratio of 1 : 3 ( w / w ) in TCB solutions , both exhibited a broad photoresponse extending from 350 to 700 nm. Especially , the device based on a ratio of PSFDTBT to PC71BM of 1 : 3 ( w / w ) in TCB solutions exhibited the maximum EQE of 72% at 479 nm. The J sc calculated from integration of the EQE with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum roughly agreed with the J sc obtained from the J-V measurements. To understand the relationship between device performances and active layer morphology , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) measurements were conducted to investigate the surface morphology of PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
