Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: In particular , the acenedithiophene family , in which two thiophenes are fused at the ends of acenes , such as benzodithiophenes ( BDTs ) , 8 naphthodithiophenes ( NDTs ) , 9 and anthradithiophenes ( ADTs ) , 10 offers multiple advantages over other classes owing to their ease of functionalization at the α-positions of thiophene substructures for easy and precise cross-coupling polymerization. Also , integration of thiophene with acene rings into a rigid and coplanar entity facilitates π-electron delocalization and induces strong π-π stacking for efficient charge transport. For example , Takimiya and co-workers reported four different NDTn isomers as shown in Figure 1 , which allowed to create a broad variety of NDTn - based polymer semiconductor materials , and high OFET performance with mobility of up to 0.77 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 based on PNDT3BT was achieved. 11 However , despite these numerous attractive properties of NDT - based polymer semiconductors , their limited solubility in organic solvents has hindered their widespread applications in organic electronics and optoelectronics. 12 To achieve the solubility and thin film uniformity required in solution processed OPVs and OFETs , NDT1 and NDT3 functionalized with two alkoxy groups were synthesized and applied in semiconductor materials recently ( Figure 1 ). 13 In addition , it was found that , compared with linear - fused NDT units , the copolymer incorporating the angular - fused NDT units can pack into higher ordered structures , thereby achieving higher OFET mobilities. It was also reported that angular - fused NDT has a lower - lying HOMO energy level than that of linearfused NDT , which could be beneficial for better air stability and greater open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) for polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). 9c Very recently , our group reported a broad bandgap D-A copolymer PzNDTTPD based on 4,9-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-naphtho [1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene and thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6dione ( TPD ). 14 The polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) with PzNDTTPD as donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor demonstrated a PCE of 5.26% with a high V oc of 0.91 V compared to the linear NDT - TPD - based copolymer PNDTTPD with a PCE of 4.0% and a V oc of 0.69 V. 15 Meanwhile , high - performance p-channel fieldeffect transistors with hole mobility of 0.067 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and an on / off current ratio of 10^9 -10^10 were obtained. It is indicative that \" zigzag \" NDT (zNDT)-based D-A polymers probably possess unique and excellent optoelectronic properties when combined with a suitable acceptor moiety. On the other hand , we noted that benzodiathiazole (BT)-or benzoxadiazole (BO)based conjugated polymers are one of the most important organic semiconductors due to their easy preparation , excellent stability , and optoelectronic characteristics , and many efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of new BT / BO derivatives.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
