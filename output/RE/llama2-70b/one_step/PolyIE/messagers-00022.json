Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: As the key building block selenium - containing heterocyclic intermediate di(2′-selenienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( DSeBT ) 6^12 was prepared by Pd - catalyzed Stille coupling reaction of dibromobenzothiadiazole 4 and monostannylselenophene 5 , which was then dibrominated by N-bromosuccinimide ( NBS ) to yield comonomer M2 ( 2 steps , 52% overall yield ). The target poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-diselenienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDSeBT ) was obtained by Suzuki polymerization of M1 and M2 in degassed toluene / water with K 3 PO 4 as an organic base , Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 as a catalyst , and P(o-tol) 3 as the corresponding ligand at 90 °C for 3 days. The crude polymer was purified by reprecipitation and Soxhlet extraction with methanol , acetone , hexane , and chlorobenzene. Details of synthesis of monomers , polymerization , and their characterizations are given in the Experimental Section. After purification , gel - permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis against PS standard exhibits a number - averaged molecular mass ( M n ) of 83^000 g / mol with a polydispersity ( PDI ) of 2.51. The polymer is readily soluble in common solvents such as chloroform , toluene , THF , and chlorobenzene. As shown in Figure 1a , the UV - vis absorption spectra of PCDSeBT both in chloroform solution and solid state exhibit two distinct absorption bands , as typically observed for donor (D)-acceptor ( A ) low bandgap materials. The absorption maxima ( λ max ) of the film are located at 403 and 589 nm. The shorter absorption band is due to π-π* transitions of the polymer backbone , 13 while the lower - energy peak is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) in the electron - rich and electron - deficient units. 14 It is worth noting that the maxima absorption values of PCDSeBT in the film are slightly broadened without any obvious red - shift when compared to the solution. This verifies that only a small reorganization via π-π stacking between the polymer chains is within view during the film formation because of the interchain aggregates in solution. 15 This observation is in contrast to many conjugated polymers , in which there is a red - shift that occurs in going from the solution to the solid state due to the aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state , 3,16 even the PCDTBT film is red - shifted by 30 nm vs solution. 5a Besides , the deep blue color of PCDSeBT solution is observed unlike the red color of PCDTBT in solution ( see the digital photograph in Figure 1a ). Notably , although the absorption profile of PCDSeBT is similar to that of the thiophene analogue , PCDTBT , the absorption onset of PCDSeBT is significantly red - shifted by ∼ 70 nm , corresponding to a lower optical bandgap ( E g opt = 1.70 eV ) than PCDTBT ( E g opt = 1.85 eV ).\n\nLet's think step by step."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paragraph describes the synthesis and characterization of a new conjugated polymer, PCDSeBT, and compares its properties with those of a related polymer, PCDTBT. The following table summarizes the properties of the materials mentioned in the paragraph:\n\n| Material Name | Material Property | Material Property (Abbr.) | Numerical Value | Condition |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PCDSeBT | Molecular weight | Mn | 83,000 g/mol | Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) |\n|  | Polydispersity | PDI | 2.51 | Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) |\n|  | Solubility | - | Chloroform, toluene, THF, chlorobenzene | - |\n|  | UV-vis absorption maxima | λmax | 403, 589 nm | - |\n|  | Optical bandgap | Egopt | 1.70 eV | - |\n| PCDTBT | Molecular weight | Mn | - | - |\n|  | UV-vis absorption maxima | λmax | - | - |\n|  | Optical bandgap | Egopt | 1.85 eV | - |\n| di(2'-selenienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DSeBT) | Molecular weight | - | 612 g/mol | - |\n| dibromobenzothiadiazole 4 | Molecular weight | - | 348 g/mol | - |\n| monostannylselenophene 5 | Molecular weight | - | 416 g/mol | - |\n| N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) | Molecular weight | - | 206 g/mol | - |\n| K3PO4 | Molecular weight | - | 158 g/mol | - |\n| Pd2(dba)3 | Molecular weight | - | 634 g/mol | - |\n| P(o-tol)3 | Molecular weight | - | 212 g/mol | - |\n\nThe table includes the molecular weights and UV-vis absorption maxima of PCDSeBT and PCDTBT, as well as the optical bandgap of PCDSeBT. The molecular weights of the monomers and intermediate compounds are also listed. The conditions under which the properties were measured are included in the table, where applicable.\n\nThe relationships between the materials can be summarized as follows:\n\n* PCDSeBT is synthesized from the monomers di(2'-selenienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DSeBT) and monostannylselenophene 5 through a Suzuki polymerization reaction.\n* PCDSeBT has a lower optical bandgap (1.70 eV) than PCDTBT (1.85 eV).\n* PCDSeBT has a deeper blue color in solution than PCDTBT.\n* The absorption profile of PCDSeBT is similar to that of PCDTBT, but with a red-shifted absorption onset by ∼ 70 nm.\n* The maxima absorption values of PCDSeBT in the film are slightly broadened without any obvious red-shift compared to the solution.\n\nThese relationships suggest that the incorporation of selenium atoms into the polymer backbone leads to a red-shifted absorption onset and a lower optical bandgap, indicating improved electron-donating properties. The similarity in absorption profiles between PCDSeBT and PCDTBT suggests that the electron-donating properties of the polymers are similar, but the selenium atoms introduce additional electron-donating ability. The difference in color between the two polymers in solution may be due to the different electron-donating properties or the presence of impurities. The slight broadening of the absorption maxima in the film suggests that there is some aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state, but this aggregation does not lead to a significant red-shift in the absorption onset."}
