Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: Three donor - acceptor type of narrow band gap conjugated polymers with enlarged coplanar skeleton were synthesized via Stille copolymerization of indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) and naphtho [1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) ( NT ) based monomers. The energy levels , absorption spectra and band gaps of the resulting polymers were well tuned by utilizing different thiophene derivatives as spacer between IDT and NT units , and polymer PIDT-C12NT which employed bithiophene attached with dodecyl side chain as spacer exhibited superior properties compared to the other two copolymers. All polymers exhibited deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and subsequently lead to high open circuit voltages of fabricated solar cell devices. Best performance of the bulk - heterojunction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 5.05% was achieved with PIDT-C12NT as donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor , which can be attributed to its higher charge carrier mobility , the optimized interpenetrating network as well as enhanced absorption coefficient of photoactive layer with respect to the other two polymers. The results demonstrated that the combination of IDT and NT with appropriate spacers was a promising molecular design strategy for the application of solar cells . During the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted extensive attention due to their lightweight , low cost and great potential for the fabrication of large - area flexible devices. 1-3 PSCs based on bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) architecture are of particular interests since high performance devices with power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) exceed 8% can be achieved. 4-9 Typical BHJ devices comprise a phaseseparated donor / acceptor blend layer with low band gap conjugated polymers as the electron donor , and fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as the electron acceptor. 10,11 Generally , when considering that open circuit voltage ( V oc ) is related to the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level of donor materials and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of acceptor , 12,13 deep HOMO levels for low band gap conjugated polymers are preferred in order to attain high V oc . However , lowering HOMO level would result in larger band gap , and thereby the absorption of resulted polymers would have less overlap with solar spectrum , which are unfavorable for high short circuit current ( J sc ). To obtain the ideal low band gap polymer with appropriate energy levels that can make a tradeoff between open circuit voltage ( V oc ) and band gap so as to maximize the PCE , an intriguing approach involves incorporat - ing electron rich moieties ( donor , D ) and electron deficient moieties ( acceptor , A ) and alternating them on the backbone , which are so - called D-A type low band gap conjugated polymers.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
