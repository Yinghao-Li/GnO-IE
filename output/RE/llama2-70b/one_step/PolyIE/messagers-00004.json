Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: In the solid state , the planarity effect and interchain stacking of PffBB-n caused the bathochromic shift of the absorption cut - off to ∼ 780 nm , corresponding to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.61 eV. Density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations was carried out to probe the molecular and electronic properties of the PffBB-n polymer by means of B3LYP / 6-311+(d,p) as a basis set in a vacuum using the repeating conjugated units of the polymer backbone in which all of the alkyl substitutions were replaced by ethyl groups to reduce the calculation time. Figure 2 displays the optimized molecular conformation and the frontier molecular orbitals of the ethyl-substituted repeating units of PffBB-n. The dihedral angle between the BDT electron - donating unit and the electron - deficient unit was found to be ∼ 26.9 ° in the optimized structure , which is caused by the ethyl substitution on the thienyl ring. The HOMO delocalizes extensively over the π-conjugation framework , whereas the LUMO mainly populated on the benzothiadiazole Article unit. Such frontier molecular orbital electron distribution would greatly enhance efficient intramolecular charge transfer. The electrochemical properties of PffBB-n were determined by cyclic voltammetry. Their results are summarized in Table 2 , and the respective energy levels are delineated in Figure 2d. The HOMO energy levels of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 were estimated from the onset oxidation potential to be -5.66 , -5.73 , -5.72 , and -5.78 eV , respectively. The corresponding LUMO energy levels were calculated from the HOMO energy level and the onset absorption of polymers in thin films , which were -4.01 , -4.11 , -4.11 , and -4.16 eV , respectively. As a result , the HOMO energy levels of PffBB-n polymers are much lower than that of ITO and their corresponding LUMO energy levels of PffBB-n lied slightly above that of PC71BM. Such energy level alignment would facilitate charge transfer from the donor polymer to the PC71BM acceptor and provide a relatively large difference between the HOMO energy level of donor polymers and the LUMO level of PC71BM , which is important to achieve a large V oc of a solar device. As a result , BHJ PSCs fabricated from these polymers are promising to achieve high device performance. X-Ray Diffraction ( XRD ). X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out to determine the crystallinity of PffBB-n polymers and the XRD spectra are shown in Figure 3. Despite various sizes of alkyl side chains attached , polymers with the same backbone show very similar XRD patterns. The sharp peaks at around 5 ° correspond to the in-plane spacing ( d 1spacing ) between the polymer backbones , whereas the broad peaks lying above 20 ° ( d 2 -spacing ) is characterized as a π-π stacking distance.\n\nLet's think step by step."},

The table also includes the HOMO energy level of ITO and the LUMO energy level of PC71BM for comparison.\n\nThe relationships between the materials can be summarized as follows:\n\n* PffBB-n polymers have a bathochromic shift in their absorption spectrum in the solid state, which is caused by the planarity effect and interchain stacking.\n* PffBB-n polymers have a narrow optical band gap, which is suitable for organic solar cells.\n* The HOMO energy levels of PffBB-n polymers are lower than that of ITO, while their LUMO energy levels are slightly above that of PC71BM.\n* The HOMO delocalization and LUMO population of PffBB-n polymers are extensive and mainly on the benzothiadiazole unit, respectively.\n* The dihedral angle between the BDT electron-donating unit and the electron-deficient unit is 26.9° in the optimized structure of PffBB-n.\n* The XRD patterns of PffBB-n polymers are similar, despite various sizes of alkyl side chains attached.\n\nThese relationships suggest that PffBB-n polymers have promising properties for use in organic solar cells, including high HOMO energy levels, low LUMO energy levels, and suitable optical band gaps. The similarity in XRD patterns among the polymers with different alkyl side chains suggests that the backbone structure plays a more important role in determining the crystallinity of the polymers."}
