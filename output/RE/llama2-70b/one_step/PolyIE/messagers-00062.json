Make sure the table items are from the original paragraph.\n\nParagraph: As the annealing temperature increased from 25 to 140 °C , weak diffraction peaks at 25.4 ° , 27.8 ° , and 29.3 ° emerged , and the diffraction peaks at 21.4 ° and 23.8 ° were slightly increased. Similarly , for PzNDTDTBO , after annealing at 220 °C , weak diffraction peaks at 4.3 ° and 8.5 ° appeared , and the peak at 32.9 ° , corresponding to a π-π stacking distance of 2.7 Å , became stronger and sharper. These XRD studies clearly manifest the enhancement of molecular ordering within thin films of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO after annealing , which are in agreement with the observation that hole mobilities of devices increase with annealing. In addition , the high crystallinity of the PzNDTDTBO film can also explain the high hole mobility of the PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM blend film measured by SCLC method mentioned above. AFM images were performed on polymer thin films on OTSmodified SiO 2 / Si substrates as shown in Figure 12. The highly uniform intertwined polymer fibers are observed for both of the two polymers. With film annealing treatments , the films form larger crystal grains and better film interconnectivity , which are favorable for the charge transport and lead to an increase of the mobility . In conclusion , two new D-A copolymers with zNDT as donor unit and BT or BO as acceptor unit , namely PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO , have been synthesized by the Pd - catalyzed Stille - coupling reaction and well characterized. Both the copolymers possess good solubility and thermal stability as well as low bandgap for efficient photon harvesting. Compared with its BT - based analogue PzNDTDTBT , the introduction of the stronger electron - accepting BO unit into PzNDTDTBO not only enhanced the intramolecular charge transfer in the conjugated polymer but also downshifted the HOMO energy level of the organic semiconductor , and as a result , BHJ solar cells incorporating blends of the PzNDTDTBO with PC71BM showed the PCE of 5.07% after device optimization such as adding additive and thermal annealing , while a PCE of 3.22% was obtained in PzNDTDTBT - based devices. OFETs devices based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO exhibit high carrier mobilities of 0.43 and 0.34 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. Both the hole mobilities and PCEs are among the highest values in the current reported devices fabricated from naphthodithiophenebased copolymers. These results demonstrate that the 4,9bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho [1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene is a promising versatile core unit for developing high - performance OFETs and polymer solar cells.\n\nLet's think step by step."},
