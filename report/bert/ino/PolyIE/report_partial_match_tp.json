PffBB - n exhibited not only strong and wide absorption but also controllable aggregation behavior in solution and thin films , in which aggregation behavior was greatly influenced by the length of alkyl side chains attached , temperature applied , and solvent used . Aggregation - induced spectral broadening further extended the absorption cutoff to ∼ 780 nm in thin films , leading to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Because of the strong aggregation strength , PffBB - n equipped with long alkyl side chains shows enhanced ordered molecular packing and good crystallinity as revealed by X - ray diffraction studies . In addition , temperature - dependent aggregation of the PffBB - n : PC71BM blend was investigated and optimized in the PSC fabrication . PSCs fabricated with the PffBB - n : PC71BM blend , conducted at 80 ° C optimized coating temperature , showed relatively high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) ranging from 8.22 to 9.93 % .",

The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the resulting polymers , PBT and PTT , were substantially stabilized when compared to those of the parent P3HT .

Therefore , the absorption band located in the high energy region was attributed to π - π * transitions , whereas the broad absorption at around 560 nm corresponded to the intramolecular charge transfer band and the long - wavelength absorption emerged at ∼ 680 nm was due to the polymer interchain stacking aggregation . This aggregation - induced absorption is temperature - sensitive in which the absorption decreases with the increase of temperature , resulting from polymer chain segregation at high temperature . The incorporation of an alkyl side chain can often render a better solubility of a polymer ; however , the long alkyl side chain can exert stronger alkyl - alkyl chain interactions that can give rise to a strong aggregation of polymer chains . As shown in Figure 1 , the aggregation ability / strength of PffBB - n polymers also enhanced with an increase in the size of the alkyl side chains ( from n = 10 to 16 ) .

The decyl - substituted PffBB-10 - based device showed a good PCE of 8.22 % with a high V oc of 0.93 V , a J sc of 14.62 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 60.44 % when the active layer was coated at 80 ° C. On the other hand , PffBB-10 - based devices fabricated at 60 and 100 ° C spin - coating temperatures exhibited inferior photovoltaic performance with a lower J sc and a much lower FF of ∼ 56 % except for a similar V oc . Furthermore , BHJ PSCs based on PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 also exhibited the same trend in which their highest PCE was achieved by spin - coating the active blend layer at 80 ° C .",

The decrease in both the J sc and FF could be due to inferior polymer chain packing in the active layer leading to a poor charge transporting network . Besides , the device performance generally varied with the length of alkyl side chains attached onto the polymer backbone . The device efficiency initially increases upon the incorporation of longer alkyl side chains from decyl to tetradecyl reaching a maximum at tetradecyl - substituted PffBB-14 and then declines with further alkyl side chain extension . Importantly , such chain Article length - dependent device performance trend is spin - coating temperature independent . The champion PffBB-14 - based device affords the highest PCE of 9.93 % with a V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36 % . The size of the alkyl side chain is known to affect the processability and interchain interactions of a polymer , which would provide a tool to optimize the π - π stacking interactions of a polymer in the solid state . A size - optimized alkyl side chain would provide a good balance between the π - π stacking interactions of the polymer backbone and the alkyl - alkyl side chain interactions resulting in a highly ordered molecular packing for efficient charge transport .

Therefore , the introduction of more thienyl spacer could stabilize LUMO+1 ( π * ) due to the better conjugation , resulting in the red - shift of the absorption band . At the same time , it could decrease the D - A nature of the polymer due to the weaker electron acceptability of DTP , resulting in the blueshift of the charge transfer bands . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the polymers and estimate the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers . Representative cyclic voltammogram ( CV ) curves of these copolymers are shown in Fig . 2 Crystalline order of the copolymer thin films was investigated by X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) scans ( Fig . S2 † ) . In the out - of - plane measurement , the XRD pattern of PDTP - BT reveals a weak peak near 6 ° , and there is no clear peak for PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT , suggesting that they exhibit amorphous structures in the film , which might be due to the bulky side chain in the DTP building block . A change in the number of thienyl spacers in this system does not significantly affect the aggregation behaviour of the polymer main chains .",

Here , the atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was applied to investigate the morphology of the blend film of the polymer : PC 70 BM fabricated from CB and DCB solutions , respectively , as shown in Fig . 3 . For PDTP - BT : PC 70 BM , both CB and DCB gave the films with obvious phase separation with a root mean square ( RMS ) of 2.222 nm and 0.880 nm , respectively , which might be due to the poor miscibility of the two materials . For PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT , the blend film of polymer / PC 70 BM spin - coated from CB was also rough , but the blend films fabricated from DCB displayed a much smoother surface with a RMS of 0.188 nm and 0.259 nm , respectively . This smaller roughness of the blend film indicates that the domain size of the phase separation of the donor - acceptor interpenetrating network could be reduced , which could be beneficial for the exciton charge separation and charge transport . These results indicate that the morphologies of these polymers with PC 70 BM are quite sensitive to the solvents used for device processing and the introduction of a thienyl spacer could improve the miscibility .",

The former could be ruled out because the PEBDTPD polymer had a slightly higher LUMO level as the POBDTPD polymer . The latter was thus mainly responsible for the effective PL quenching , as confirmed from the film morphology studies . That is , the miscibility between polymers and PC 70 BM is an important factor for efficient exciton separation . Conclusively , morphology and PL quenching studies revealed that the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film has more favorable features for the higher J sc . Carrier mobilities were measured to estimate the ability of hole and electron transport and the carrier mobility balance . The hole mobilities of the polymers or the polymer : PC 70 BM blends were measured via the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method using hole - only devices ( ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer or polymer : PC 70 BM / Au ) . The JL 3 -V characteristics of the polymers and the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films are shown in Figure 7 . For all films , a slope of 2 in the log JL 3 - log V plot was observed , which is a signature of SCLC transport .",

Although these hole mobilities of homopolymers were nearly identical , the hole mobility in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film decreased only slightly to 1.2 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , whereas that in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film decreased significantly to 3.5 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The considerable mobility decrease in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film may result from the less uniform , more aggregated morphology as aforementioned . In addition , the electron mobilities of the polymer : PC 70 BM blends were measured using electron - only devices ( Al / polymer : PC 70 BM / Al ) . The electron mobilities were 8.8 × 10 ^ -6 and 1.1 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM and PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blends , respectively .

The less balanced carrier transport in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film accounts for the lower FF . The polymers and polymer blend films were also analyzed by X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) studies . Figure 8 shows the XRD patterns of the polymers and the polymer : PC 70 BM blends . All film XRD results were similar and showed weak crystalline features with a broad peak around 23 ° . The crystalline features corresponding to π - stacking among the conjugated polymer backbones were also observed among TT - based polymers ; 25 however , the peaks were broader , and no crystalline peaks were observed at smaller angles around 4.4 ° . This less crystalline feature was possibly caused by the more twisted polymer backbones , as compared to PTB7 or PBDTTPD polymer backbones .

The photoconversion process in OPVs is accomplished by efficient light absorption by conjugated polymers and accepting materials , charge separation at the interface of the donor polymer and the accepting materials , and subsequent charge collection at the electrodes . Matching the absorption of the conjugated polymer to the solar spectrum determines the ultimate performance of the solar cell . Among the variety of conjugated polymers that have been studied , poly(p - phenylenevinylene ) ( PPV ) , 2 poly(alkylfluorene ) ( PF ) , and polythiophene ( PT ) 3 derivatives are typical p - type electron donor materials . However , the performance of photovoltaic cells with these polymers is limited by their relatively large band gap energies , which are not yet optimized with respect to the solar spectrum . Therefore , the design and synthesis of new low - band gap polymers become very important to better harvest the solar spectrum , especially in the red and near - infrared ranges , which can lead to possible enhancements in the photocurrents of OPVs . 4 The most widely used approach for obtaining low - band gap structures is to utilize internal charge transfer ( ICT ) from an electron - donating to an electron - accepting moiety . 5 - 7 Some interesting structures using the ICT approach have been reported .",

The Al electrode was removed by dipping the devices for 1 min in a mixed acid solution containing of 16 mL of concentrated phosphoric acid , 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid , 1 mL of acetic acid , and 2 mL of D 2 O. The blend films showed almost equivalently measured smooth surfaces ( according to their root - mean - square ( rms ) roughness ) with small degrees of phase separation . The rms roughness of the active layers were 0.49 nm for PFDTBT , 0.44 nm for PFDTBT-10Per , 0.51 nm for PFD2TBT , and 0.50 nm for PFD2TBT-10Per , respectively . This result suggests that the morphologies of all the active films are very similar , so that such a property will not affect the J sc of the photovoltaic devices . Therefore , the improvement of PCE and J sc in the fabricated photovoltaic devices is derived from the enhanced π - π interaction between polymers that results from the introduction of perylene units . We introduced perylene units into PFDTBT and PFD2TBT to enhance the interchain π - π interaction . The optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized copolymers showed were slight modification upon perylene addition . Interestingly , the field - effect mobility of the TFTs , using the polymers as the active layer increased with an increasing perylene content in the copolymers . The short circuit currents of the photovoltaic devices fabricated using the polymers as an electron donor , also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased , which is consistent with the field - effect mobility results of the polymers . We conclude that the introduction of perylene to the conjugated polymer chain enhances the π - π interaction between polymer chains and improves its charge - transport ability , leading to increases short circuit currents in the photovoltaic devices .

Nevertheless , a low power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been the largest obstacle in OPVs . 6 To improve the PCE , the following idealistic conditions are required in conjugated polymers : 14 ( 1 ) a low bandgap with a wide absorption area , ( 2 ) a crystalline structure to produce good charge transport characteristics , ( 3 ) a low highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level to produce a high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and ( 4 ) an appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level for effective electron charge transfer to fullerene . To acquire good charge transport characteristics , it is necessary to increase the close packing among polymers through the reduction of energetic disorder by increasing the coplanarity and the interchain π - π interaction . In the Janssen group , a copolymer containing terthiophene was reported , which shows an increase in planarity packing and high mobility characteristics , and a diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative showed a PCE of 4.7 % and a high hole mobility ( 0.04 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ) . 15 In the Jen group , a hole mobility of 0.029 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 and a PCE of 6.2 % were reported in a copolymer that contained an indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) unit and a phenanthrenequinoxaline unit .",

Compared with PCZDTB , formation of a planar backbone and stronger π - π stacking were observed in PQCDTB ( see Supporting Information ) . On the basis of this result , it has been confirmed that π - π stacking was more effective in PQCDTB than in PCZDTB because of coplanarity of the quinacridone unit that was introduced to the main chain of PQCDTB . 13 Figure 2 showed the UV - visible spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB .

On the other hand , the maximum absorption peaks of PCZDTB ( λ max ) were observed at 386 and 514 nm in solution . The band around 380 nm in the absorption spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB can be assigned to π - π * transition whereas the 530 - 550 band are due to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between donor and acceptor moieties . 10 The absorption spectrum of PQCDTB is broadened and red - shifted compared to that of PCZDTB . This can be explained by the much stronger ICT effects in the PQCDTB than that in PCZDTB .",

Aromatic imides such as rylene diimides are one of the classical n - type building blocks and can exhibit relatively high electron affinities , high electron mobilities , and excellent chemical , thermal , and photochemical stabilities . 4 These materials are electron deficient due to the substitution of an aromatic core with one or two sets of π - accepting imide groups that are mutually conjugated .",

Hence , delocalization of the conjugated π - electron system along the copolymer backbone is disfavored by the incorporation of this unit . This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation . Additionally , compared to a single thiophene ring , it must be pointed out that due to the large resonance stabilization energy of BDT , the delocalization of electrons from the BDT unit into the backbone is less favorable than from the thiophene ring . As a result , a more stable copolymer with high performance can be obtained by using BDT as the core unit .

It should be noted that the LUMO levels are on the borderline for fast electron transfer to PC 70 BM whose LUMO level is -4.3 eV. 51 This result indicated that the DTPD acted as a very strong electron - withdrawing unit in donor - acceptor - type low band gap polymers , as predicted in the DFT calculation .",

In the case of PCDSeBT , the as - cast thin films show very weak diffractions ( Figure 3b ) .

This result suggests that the morphologies of all the active films are very similar , so that such a property will not affect the J sc of the photovoltaic devices . Therefore , the improvement of PCE and J sc in the fabricated photovoltaic devices is derived from the enhanced π - π interaction between polymers that results from the introduction of perylene units . We introduced perylene units into PFDTBT and PFD2TBT to enhance the interchain π - π interaction . The optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized copolymers showed were slight modification upon perylene addition . Interestingly , the field - effect mobility of the TFTs , using the polymers as the active layer increased with an increasing perylene content in the copolymers . The short circuit currents of the photovoltaic devices fabricated using the polymers as an electron donor , also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased , which is consistent with the field - effect mobility results of the polymers . We conclude that the introduction of perylene to the conjugated polymer chain enhances the π - π interaction between polymer chains and improves its charge - transport ability , leading to increases short circuit currents in the photovoltaic devices .

Nevertheless , a low power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been the largest obstacle in OPVs . 6 To improve the PCE , the following idealistic conditions are required in conjugated polymers : 14 ( 1 ) a low bandgap with a wide absorption area , ( 2 ) a crystalline structure to produce good charge transport characteristics , ( 3 ) a low highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level to produce a high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and ( 4 ) an appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level for effective electron charge transfer to fullerene . To acquire good charge transport characteristics , it is necessary to increase the close packing among polymers through the reduction of energetic disorder by increasing the coplanarity and the interchain π - π interaction . In the Janssen group , a copolymer containing terthiophene was reported , which shows an increase in planarity packing and high mobility characteristics , and a diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative showed a PCE of 4.7 % and a high hole mobility ( 0.04 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ) . 15 In the Jen group , a hole mobility of 0.029 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 and a PCE of 6.2 % were reported in a copolymer that contained an indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) unit and a phenanthrenequinoxaline unit .",

Compared with PCZDTB , formation of a planar backbone and stronger π - π stacking were observed in PQCDTB ( see Supporting Information ) .

This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation .

Interestingly , the branched alkyl chains of 2ethylhexyloxy groups stabilized the HOMO level slightly more than the linear alkyl chains of octyloxy groups , which is in line with previous reports . 47 - 50 The LUMO levels of POBDTPD and PEBDTPD were -4.00 and -4.06 eV , respectively . This less dependence of the polymer LUMO level on substituted alkyl chains is again consistent with the previous report . 47 This different dependence of the HOMO or LUMO levels on the substituted alkyl chains might be originated from the fact that the alkoxy chains affect the position of the HOMO level than the LUMO level since they participate to some degree in the construction of HOMO but does little in the formation of LUMO according to our DFT calculation ( Figure 3 ) . It should be noted that the LUMO levels are on the borderline for fast electron transfer to PC 70 BM whose LUMO level is -4.3 eV. 51 This result indicated that the DTPD acted as a very strong electron - withdrawing unit in donor - acceptor - type low band gap polymers , as predicted in the DFT calculation .",

The HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT was determined to be -5.40 eV according to the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ) , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential in volts vs Ag / Ag + . 16 Since the open circuit voltage V oc of BHJ PSCs is correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , 5,17 therefore a higher V oc for PSFDTBT based polymer solar cells is anticipated due to the low - lying HOMO energy level .",

      "text": "Similar results were observed between PQCDTB and PC61BM as well . When the PCZDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 4 , a smooth morphology was detected , and no fibril domain was observed , just like the PQCDTB , because the self - organization of PCZDTB is lower than that of PQCDTB . 9 In this study , PQCDTB has been successfully synthesized through the Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing planar quinacridone unit and a broad - absorption benzothiadiazole unit . PQCDTB had a high molecular weight and good thermal stability . Because of the appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels , an effective balance was produced . According to the X - ray diffraction measurement , a broad diffraction peak was observed at approximately 24.0 ° . In terms of the π - π stacking distance ( d π ) , a significantly shorter distance ( 3.7 Å ) was observed . These values were similar to the results of the thiophene and thiophenefused aromatic system polymers . When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the highest efficiency was detected , and V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8 % , and 2.5 % , respectively . When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the polymer formed a fibril - type domain and microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM . Because of selforganization , PQCDTB showed a higher FF compared with PCZDTB .",

      "text": "On the other hand , the fused rings can make the polymer backbone more rigid and coplanar , therefore enhancing effective π - conjugation , lowering bandgap , and extending absorption . 28 - 31 Therefore , fused - ring building blocks are widely used in synthesis of conjugated polymers . 32 - 34 For example , the large planar benzodithiophene ( BDT ) unit has emerged as an attractive building block for conjugated polymers . 35 Benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene ( 7 , Figure 2 ) with a curved structure prevents a fully conjugated pathway between substituents at the 2 - and 6 - positions . Hence , delocalization of the conjugated π - electron system along the copolymer backbone is disfavored by the incorporation of this unit . This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation . Additionally , compared to a single thiophene ring , it must be pointed out that due to the large resonance stabilization energy of BDT , the delocalization of electrons from the BDT unit into the backbone is less favorable than from the thiophene ring . As a result , a more stable copolymer with high performance can be obtained by using BDT as the core unit . OFETs based on a benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene copolymer manufactured on flexible substrate exhibited high hole mobility of 0.5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 when the source - gate voltage is increased to 60 V.",
