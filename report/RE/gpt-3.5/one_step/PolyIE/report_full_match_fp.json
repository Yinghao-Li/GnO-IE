      "text": "Such high energy alignment would not enable to achieve a large open - circuit voltage and is eventually detrimental to the PCE output of PT - based PSCs such as in P3HT / PCBM systems with PCE ranging from 3 to 4 % . 21,22 Geng and co - workers synthesized two PT - based donor materials by incorporating carboxylate side chains and vinylene linkers between thiophene units . The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the resulting polymers , PBT and PTT , were substantially stabilized when compared to those of the parent P3HT . Such energy level lowering was attributed to the integration of carboxylate and vinylene groups giving rise to a push - pull structural motif , resulting in an enhanced PCE of the PV devices based on them . 21 Over the years , the use of the structural effect to enhance PSC performance has been extensively investigated , particularly the donor - acceptor (D - A) strategy , which has been proved to be an effective approach to develop donor polymers with wide absorption , low - lying energy levels , and enhanced electron properties . 23 - 32 Besides , conjugation expansion on the polymer backbone is an alternative tool to improve the electronic properties of polymers . By replacing a branched 2ethylhexyl side chain with a linear n - octyl group , Zhang and his co - workers synthesized a PTB7 - Th derivative namely , PBTT . PV cells based on PBTT : IEICO showed a superior device performance than that of the PTB7 - Th - based device with a PCE of 9.5 % , a V oc of 0.86 V , a J sc of 17.9 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 61.3 % . Such dramatic enhancement in efficiency was attributed to a higher charge mobility and improved morphology of the PBTT : IEICO blend film induced by the less steric hindered linear alkyl side chain . 1 Yang and coworkers used selenophene to replace thiophene π - bridge in the indacenodithiophene (IDT)-benzo[1,2 - c:4,5 - c′]dithiophene-4,8 - dione (BDD)-based copolymer (PThBDDIDT) to develop a donor - π - acceptor type copolymer , PSeBDDIDT . The PCE of solar cells based on polymer : PC71BM as an active layer was dramatically increased from 7.04 to 8.65 % , respectively . Such improvement could result from stronger intermolecular interactions , expanded absorption range , and better molecular planarity of selenophene contained PSeBDDIDT . 33 Random terpolymers comprised of thieno[2′,3′ : 5′,6′]pyrido [3,4- g]- thieno[3,2 - c]isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione , thiophene (T) , and dithiophene (2 T) were synthesized by Yang and co - workers in which the crystallinity of terpolymers could be controlled by varying the compositions of T and 2T. The PSC based on a terpolymer with the optimized T / 2 T ratio of 7 : 3 showed a high J sc of 18.3 mA cm^-2 and a FF of 71.2 % , thus resulting in an enhanced PCE up to 10.8 % . 34 Fluorination on polymer backbones has also been widely adopted to tune and improve the functional properties of donor polymers such as stabilization of their energy levels and hence positively impacting on PSC performance .",

The PSC based on J91 / m - ITIC as an active layer with thermal annealing gave a high PCE of 11.63 % with a high V oc of 0.98 V and a J sc of 18.03 mA cm^-2 . 36 The improved cell performance was attributed to the suppression of carrier recombination imposed by the difluorosubstituted side chain . In addition to influencing molecular and functional properties of donor polymers , the structural modification could lead to severe aggregation , which could hamper solution processability of a polymer . On the other hand , aggregation could be desirable and provide a useful tool to control the bulkheterojunction (BHJ) film morphology and then the photovoltaic performance of a solar cell . Yan and co - workers employed the branched alkyl chains attached on the backbone of the difluorobenzothiadiazole - quaterthiophene (PffBT4 T) copolymer to acquire desirable temperature - dependent aggregation behavior . By spin - casting the polymer solution at an elevated temperature , they could control the morphology and crystallinity of the polymer films . Taking advantage of this aggregation control approach , high - performance PSCs based on PffBT4T-2OD : PC71BM were fabricated affording a PCE of up to 10.8 % . 9 Guo and co - workers used a number of fused thiophene spacers to tune the aggregation behavior of difluorobenzoxadiazole (ffBX)-based donor polymers among which PffBX - TT with thieno[3,2 - b]thiophene as a spacer showed intermediate temperature - dependent aggregation strength allowing the control of blend film morphology during PSC fabrication . PSCs using PffBX - TT : PC71BM as an active layer gave a maximum PCE of 9.10 % . 37 Previously , we developed a class of benzodithiophene - based donor polymers with fluoro - dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole being an acceptor unit that showed interesting temperature - dependent aggregation behavior when equipped with linear alkyl side chains . PSCs based on these polymers : PC71BM blend layers showed good photovoltaic performance with a maximum PCE as high as 9.70 % . 38 In this contribution , we reported a new series of donor polymer materials based on benzodithiophene (BDT) and difluorinated dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole , PffBB - n (n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16) , which exhibited strong aggregation behavior in both solution and thin films . In addition to the size of alkyl side chains attached on the backbone of the polymer , aggregation can be modulated by the solvent used and temperature applied on the film with which the absorption cut - off extended down to ∼ 780 nm in thin films , resulting in a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Such wide absorption is desirable and complementary to that of the commonly used PC71BM acceptor material in the visible light region , which can increase light harvesting in BHJ PSCs .",

Among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs fabricated , PffBB-14 with strongest aggregation strength / behavior exhibited the most promising photovoltaic performance , with a maximum PCE of 9.93 % , a large V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36 % . Such a superior device efficiency was attributed to the greatly enhanced exciton dissociation , higher and balanced charge carrier mobilities , and less recombination losses in the active layer of the PffBB-14 : PC71BM - based cells . Our results demonstrated that the modulation of aggregation behavior through structural modification and temperature tuning could effectively optimize the physical and optoelectronic properties of a material and device for solar cell applications . Synthesis and Physical Properties of Polymers . The PffBB - n (n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16) polymers were synthesized according to the optimized literature procedures and the synthetic scheme is shown in Scheme 1.^39 The Corey - House synthesis of 3 - bromothiophene and oxalyl dichloride gave 1,2di(thiophen-3 - yl)ethane-1,2 - dione (1) as a brown needle - like crystal in a good yield (70 %) . Oxidative cyclization of 1 in the presence of iron(III) chloride carried out in diluted dichloromethane (DCM) solution yielded a dark purple benzodithiophene-4,5 - diketone (2) crystal . Acetylation of 2 with Zn powder and acetic anhydride performed under basic conditions produced yellowish benzodithiophene-4,5 - diyl diacetate (3) powder in a good yield of 85 % . 3 was then alkylated with 2ethylhexyl bromide in the presence of Cs 2 CO 3 yielding 4,5bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)benzodithiophene (4) as a sticky colorless liquid . Proton abstraction of 4 by n - BuLi followed by the reaction with tri - butyltin chloride gave the polycondensation precursor , 4,5 - bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)-2,7 - bis(tri - n - butylstannyl)benzodithiophene (5) . To preserve high reactivity , the crude product was subjected to flash chromatography and kept under -20 ° C for the condensation reaction . Alkylation of the thiophene ring was carried out by Kumada coupling , yielding 3 - alkylthiophene as a colorless oil or a white solid (6 - 9) . Lithiation of alkylated thiophene followed by quenching with tri - butyltin chloride afforded tri - butyl(4alkylthiophene-2 - yl)stannane (10 - 13) . Subsequent coupling with 4,7 - dibromo-5,6 - difluorobenzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole afforded dithienyl - substituted difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole , 14 - 17 . NBS bromination of 14 - 17 produced the acceptor units , 18 - 21 , respectively , which were carefully purified through chromatography and recrystallization to ensure high reactivity for the condensation reaction . The Stille polycondensation reaction of donor unit 5 and acceptor units 18 - 21 was carried out under the catalyst of Pd(PPh 3) 4 in chlorobenzene solutions at 150 ° C for 3 days that could afford the corresponding polymers as a dark green solid .

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations was carried out to probe the molecular and electronic properties of the PffBB - n polymer by means of B3LYP / 6 - 311+(d , p) as a basis set in a vacuum using the repeating conjugated units of the polymer backbone in which all of the alkyl substitutions were replaced by ethyl groups to reduce the calculation time . Figure 2 displays the optimized molecular conformation and the frontier molecular orbitals of the ethyl - substituted repeating units of PffBB - n. The dihedral angle between the BDT electron - donating unit and the electron - deficient unit was found to be ∼ 26.9 ° in the optimized structure , which is caused by the ethyl substitution on the thienyl ring . The HOMO delocalizes extensively over the π - conjugation framework , whereas the LUMO mainly populated on the benzothiadiazole Article unit . Such frontier molecular orbital electron distribution would greatly enhance efficient intramolecular charge transfer . The electrochemical properties of PffBB - n were determined by cyclic voltammetry . Their results are summarized in Table 2 , and the respective energy levels are delineated in Figure 2d . The HOMO energy levels of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 were estimated from the onset oxidation potential to be -5.66 , -5.73 , -5.72 , and -5.78 eV , respectively . The corresponding LUMO energy levels were calculated from the HOMO energy level and the onset absorption of polymers in thin films , which were -4.01 , -4.11 , -4.11 , and -4.16 eV , respectively . As a result , the HOMO energy levels of PffBB - n polymers are much lower than that of ITO and their corresponding LUMO energy levels of PffBB - n lied slightly above that of PC71BM . Such energy level alignment would facilitate charge transfer from the donor polymer to the PC71BM acceptor and provide a relatively large difference between the HOMO energy level of donor polymers and the LUMO level of PC71BM , which is important to achieve a large V oc of a solar device . As a result , BHJ PSCs fabricated from these polymers are promising to achieve high device performance . X - Ray Diffraction (XRD) . X - ray diffraction measurements were carried out to determine the crystallinity of PffBB - n polymers and the XRD spectra are shown in Figure 3 . Despite various sizes of alkyl side chains attached , polymers with the same backbone show very similar XRD patterns . The sharp peaks at around 5 ° correspond to the in - plane spacing (d 1spacing) between the polymer backbones , whereas the broad peaks lying above 20 ° (d 2 -spacing) is characterized as a π - π stacking distance .",

      "text": "Such a superior device performance is the result of the highest J sc and FF achieved (Table 3) when using 80 ° C as a spin - coating temperature compared to those fabricated at 60 or 100 ° C. The decrease in both the J sc and FF could be due to inferior polymer chain packing in the active layer leading to a poor charge transporting network . Besides , the device performance generally varied with the length of alkyl side chains attached onto the polymer backbone . The device efficiency initially increases upon the incorporation of longer alkyl side chains from decyl to tetradecyl reaching a maximum at tetradecyl - substituted PffBB-14 and then declines with further alkyl side chain extension . Importantly , such chain Article length - dependent device performance trend is spin - coating temperature independent . The champion PffBB-14 - based device affords the highest PCE of 9.93 % with a V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36 % . The size of the alkyl side chain is known to affect the processability and interchain interactions of a polymer , which would provide a tool to optimize the π - π stacking interactions of a polymer in the solid state . A size - optimized alkyl side chain would provide a good balance between the π - π stacking interactions of the polymer backbone and the alkyl - alkyl side chain interactions resulting in a highly ordered molecular packing for efficient charge transport . Figure 5a shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PffBB - n / PC71BM - based PSCs . Strong and broad photo - to - current responses were observed in the range from 330 to 780 nm in all of these PSCs , in which the absorption above 650 nm was attributed to the polymer aggregationinduced absorption broadening . Remarkably , the PffBB-14based device exhibited a much higher photoconversion Article response ranging from 350 to 500 nm than those of other devices , thus affording the highest J sc among all of these devices . As PffBB - n polymers showed similar absorption properties , the high current density of PffBB-14 - based PSC would result from well - ordered polymer : PC71BMnetwork / packing . J sc derived from the EQE spectra were estimated to be 14.12 , 14.92 , 16.29 , and 14.21 mA cm^-2 for PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based devices , respectively , which were in good agreement with those obtained from J - V characterization (Figure 6) . Charge Transfer and Recombination . The charge carrier mobilities of PffBB - n - based devices were estimated on hole - only and electron - only devices using the space - chargelimited current (SCLC) model , and the results are summarized in Table 4 . Indeed , the highest and well - balanced charge carrier mobility of the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend affords a higher J sc and FF than those of other devices . Charge dissociation probability was characterized by photogenerated current density (J ph) vs effective applied voltage (V eff) measurements .",

      "text": "Based on the definition , J ph equals to the difference between the current density of devices under 100 mW cm^-2 (J L) and that in the dark (J D) . V eff = V 0 - V , where V 0 is the voltage at which J L = J D and V is the applied voltage . When the reverse voltage is greater than 2 V , recombination will be suppressed because of a high internal electric field and thus the current density becomes saturated (J sat) . Consequently , P(E , T) = J ph / J sat could be used to describe the charge dissociation probability . The charge dissociation probability of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based cells was estimated to be 0.86 , 0.94 , 0.98 , and 0.92 , respectively . The highest exciton dissociation of the PffBB-14 - based device is anticipated to give rise to the best photovoltaic performance among these series of polymers . Figure 7 demonstrates the dependence of V oc and J sc against light intensity , which could be used to describe the recombination process in BHJ films . The V oc is directly proportional to the incident light intensity in the semilogarithmic plot with a slope of kT / q , which describes bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film , where k represents the Boltzmann constant , T is the Kelvin temperature , and q is the elementary charge . Trap - assisted recombination exists if the slope is larger than kT / q. 42 Among devices fabricated , the PffBB-14 - based cell exhibited the smallest slope of 1.10 kT / q , suggesting the least trap - assisted recombination . Bimolecular recombination was also investigated by measuring the dependence of J sc against light intensity , in which the exponential factor α in the power law of J sc ∝ P light α is used Article to indicate bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film . The closer the estimated α to 1.0 , the weaker the bimolecular recombination occurs in the device . 43 Obviously , with α = 0.98 , the PffBB-14 - based device would exhibit the least occurrence of bimolecular recombination in the active layer . In contrast , the PffBB-10 - based device showed an α value of 0.86 , indicating that the bimolecular recombination loss was severe in its BHJ film . These results consistently indicate that the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend with superior balanced charge carrier transport exhibits the least recombination loss among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs , thus affording the highest J sc and FF . Morphology of the Active Layer . AFM images of PffBBn : PC71BM blended thin films were obtained to investigate their microphase separation behavior and the corresponding AFM height and phase images recorded in the tapping mode are shown in Figure 8 . Good miscibility could be observed in all of the PffBB - n : PC71BM blended thin films , which gives rise to desirable phase separation .",

The optical band gaps of the polymers could be tuned from 1.41 eV to 1.61 eV by changing the number of thiophene spacers . Electrochemical measurements showed that the increase of band gap is mainly due to the change of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level . The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the polymer solar cells based on the three polymers and PC 70 BM reached 3.12 % with x = 2 under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . This approach could provide a simple strategy for designing high - performance D - A type photovoltaic polymers based on the existing polymers and a large potential to improve their performance further . † Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available : XRD patterns , DFT and TD - DFT calculations . See Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much interest due to their great potential to be a renewable energy technology based on simple and low cost manufacture . [1][2][3] The concept of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) utilizing mixtures of a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative is regarded as an efficient system for photovoltaic application . 4 The most representative active layers of the blend of regioregular poly(3 - hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with fullerene derivatives were extensively investigated . [5][6][7] While the advantage of P3HT is its simple structure with a relatively high hole mobility , the weak point of P3HT as the photovoltaic donor material towards efficient PSCs is the mismatch of its absorption spectrum (absorption edge is about 650 nm) with the terrestrial solar spectrum . The band gap of P3HT (1.9 eV) is larger than the optimum band gap range (1.3 - 1.5 eV) for polymer - fullerene BHJ solar cells . 8 Hence , design of photovoltaic polymers with broader absorption toward longer wavelengths , especially in the near - infrared (NIR) range , is necessary for high efficiency conjugated polymer donor materials . Thanks to the many attempts that have been made to develop NIR absorbing polymers , a notable improvement of the overall power - conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved . [9][10][11] One of the most powerful and flexible strategies to design low band gap conjugated polymers involves an alternating sequence of electron - donor (D) and electron - acceptor (A) moieties along the conjugated polymer main chain .",

These results suggest that on the absorption of the polymers , both absorption peaks and absorption coefficients could be readily controlled by tailoring the number of thienyl spacers along the polymers . 37,39,40 The absorption edge shifts from ca . 900 nm in PDTP - BT to ca . 850 nm in PDTP - DTBT and ca . 750 nm in PDTP - DT2BT , reflecting the broadening of the optical band - gap in sequence . Table 1 shows the optical band - gaps (E opt g) of all polymers estimated from the corresponding UV - vis absorption onset . PDTP - DT2BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - BT have optical band gaps of 1.61 , 1.46 and 1.41 eV , respectively , which are close to the ideal value of 1.5 eV for PSC application . These changes of the absorption spectra upon the introduction of thienyl groups can be qualitatively understood from density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the corresponding model compounds (Fig . S1 †) . The optimized structures show that all the polymer backbones are mostly planar . Time dependent DFT calculations show that the absorption band in the longer wavelength is mainly attributed to the transition from HOMO delocalized in the D - A backbone to LUMO localized in DTP units for all the polymers . On the other hand , the absorption in the shorter wavelength is largely contributed by the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1 , which is similar to π - π * transition in polythiophene judging by the shape of the orbitals . Therefore , the introduction of more thienyl spacer could stabilize LUMO+1 (π *) due to the better conjugation , resulting in the red - shift of the absorption band . At the same time , it could decrease the D - A nature of the polymer due to the weaker electron acceptability of DTP , resulting in the blueshift of the charge transfer bands . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the polymers and estimate the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers . Representative cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of these copolymers are shown in Fig . 2 Crystalline order of the copolymer thin films was investigated by X - ray diffraction (XRD) scans (Fig .

In the out - of - plane measurement , the XRD pattern of PDTP - BT reveals a weak peak near 6 ° , and there is no clear peak for PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT , suggesting that they exhibit amorphous structures in the film , which might be due to the bulky side chain in the DTP building block . A change in the number of thienyl spacers in this system does not significantly affect the aggregation behaviour of the polymer main chains .",

Optical Properties and Electronic Structures . The UV - vis absorption spectra of POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers in a chlorobenzene solution or in a thin film state are shown in Figure 1a . The absorption peaks and optical band gaps are summarized in Table 1 . POBDTPD and PEBDTPD in solution showed similar characteristics , covering a wide range absorption band of 300 - 900 nm . A strong absorption was observed at short wavelengths with a maximum peak at ∼ 490 nm ; a broad absorption peak was observed over the longer wavelength range of 550 - 900 nm . The lower absorption of POBDTPD in 550 - 900 nm is presumably related with the higher fraction of lower molecular weighted POBDTPD polymer chains compared to the PEBDTPD . 46 POBDTPD and PEBDTPD films also showed similar absorption bandwidth and shape . However , there was a pronounced difference that the PEBDTPD film showed a higher extinction coefficient (4.1 × 10 ^ 4 cm^-1 at the peak of 675 nm) than the POBDTPD (2.6 × 10 ^ 4 cm^-1 at the peak of 673 nm) , reflecting that the polymer chain packing in PEBDTPD film is better than that in POBDTPD .

This less dependence of the polymer LUMO level on substituted alkyl chains is again consistent with the previous report . 47 This different dependence of the HOMO or LUMO levels on the substituted alkyl chains might be originated from the fact that the alkoxy chains affect the position of the HOMO level than the LUMO level since they participate to some degree in the construction of HOMO but does little in the formation of LUMO according to our DFT calculation (Figure 3) . It should be noted that the LUMO levels are on the borderline for fast electron transfer to PC 70 BM whose LUMO level is -4.3 eV. 51 This result indicated that the DTPD acted as a very strong electron - withdrawing unit in donor - acceptor - type low band gap polymers , as predicted in the DFT calculation .",

Photovoltaic Performance Measurements . Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using polymer : PC 70 BM blend films . The polymer : PC 70 BM blends were dissolved in a mixed solvent containing chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8 - diiodooctane (DIO) in a volume ratio of 97 : 3 . The solutions were spincoated onto PEDOT : PSS - coated ITO substrates . A thin TiO 2 nanoparticle layer was then spin - coated onto the blend film , followed by aluminum evaporation . Devices prepared using either polymer showed the best performances for a polymer : PC 70 BM blend ratio of 1 : 2 . The solar cell properties were measured under AM1.5 G illumination , and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2 . The current density - voltage curves are shown in Figure 4a . POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices displayed reasonable open - circuit voltages (V oc) of 0.70 and 0.72 V , respectively , considering their HOMO levels , -5.23 and -5.37 eV , respectively . The POBDTPD device exhibited a short - circuit current (J sc) of 10.6 mA cm^-2 , whereas the PEBDTPD device showed a J sc of 13.5 mA cm^-2 . The fill factor (FF) values were 0.64 and 0.54 for the POBDTPD and the PEBDTPD devices , respectively . As a result , the PCEs were 4.7 % and 5.3 % for the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices , respectively . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were also measured (Figure 4b) . A high EQE response of greater than 50 % over the range 400- 550 nm was observed for both polymer devices . The EQEs were higher for the PEBDTPD device in the 550 - 900 nm range , partly because the PEBDTPD polymer has a higher light absorption at long wavelengths (Figure 1a) , which is consistent with the higher J sc values in the PEBDTPD device . To understand the reasons of the higher J sc and the lower FF in the PEBDTPD device , as compared with the POBDTPD device more specifically , we investigated film morphology , exciton separation , and carrier mobility in the polymer films and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films . First , film morphology was Figure 6 shows the PL spectra of the polymers and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films spin - coated from CB solutions or CB solutions containing 3 vol % DIO additives . Both the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers displayed PL with a peak around 990 nm . Blending polymers with PC 70 BMs , especially with an aid of the DIO additive , significantly quenched PL . This effective PL quenching suggested that the exciton separation was highly efficient in both the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films .",

Figure 8 shows the XRD patterns of the polymers and the polymer : PC 70 BM blends . All film XRD results were similar and showed weak crystalline features with a broad peak around 23 ° . The crystalline features corresponding to π - stacking among the conjugated polymer backbones were also observed among TT - based polymers ; 25 however , the peaks were broader , and no crystalline peaks were observed at smaller angles around 4.4 ° . This less crystalline feature was possibly caused by the more twisted polymer backbones , as compared to PTB7 or PBDTTPD polymer backbones .

The intrinsic properties of PCDSeBT are not only characterized by UV - vis absorption , cyclic voltammetry (CV) , and organic field - effect transistors (OFETs) but also the surface morphology , mobilities of space charge - limited current (SCLC) model , and polymer solar cells (PSCs) in its bulkheterojunction (BHJ) active layer with [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are evaluated in detail . It is found that PCDSeBT simultaneously has a low - lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level at -5.4 eV and a low bandgap of 1.70 eV as required by the ideal polymers for BHJ PSCs . The high current of 11.7 mA / cm^2 is obtained for PCDSeBT - based PSCs , to our knowledge , which is among the highest short - circuit current density (J SC) values obtained from a BHJ device consisting of PCDTBT derivatives and [6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) . The high J SC value , along with a moderate fill factor (FF) of 45 % and a high open - circuit voltage (V OC) of 0.79 V , yields a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.12 % , which is about 37 % increase in PCE from a PCDTBT - based reference device . On the basis of our results , one can be concluded that the DSeBT placement for construction of donor (D)-acceptor (A) polymers is an easy and effective way to realize both the higher J SC and V OC values in PSCs , as a consequence of the selective lower - lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) with the HOMO being almost unchanged , together with the effective broadening on the absorption band . With deep understanding of efficient photoinduced electron transfer within an interpenetrating network by simple blending π - conjugated polymers (electron donor) with fullerene derivatives (electron acceptor) , 1 bulk - heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on poly(3 - hexylthiophene) (P3HT) : [6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) have been extensively investigated , leading to great progress in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4 - 5 % . 2 Yet , the PCE of P3HT - based PSCs is limited by its relatively large bandgap (∼ 1.9 eV) with major loss of the solar radiation as well as low open circuit - voltage (V OC ≅ 0.6 V) due to the relatively small energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM .",

This approach has provided a remarkable short - circuit current density (J SC) of 16 mA / cm^2 , 3 whereas , in general , the V OC has suffered 4 because of a higher than the HOMO optimal energy level in order to pursue a lower bandgap . In the PSCs community , poly(2,7 - carbazole - altdithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) is one excellent exam - ple for a low HOMO (-5.45 eV) as required by the ' ideal ' πconjugated polymers , which led to a high V OC value over 0.8 V and outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures . 5 The initial PCE reached 3.6 % 6 in a typical BHJ device and has been subsequently improved to exceeding 6 % by BHJ layer thickness optimization and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures . 7 However , the bandgap of PCDTBT is still relatively larger than the proposed 1.5 - 1.7 eV of the ideal polymers for PCEs exceeding 10 % . Recently , to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT without sacrificing its high V OC , Hsu et al . 8 and our group 9 independently reported PCDTBT - based ladder - type polymers with forced planarity of which device performance showed impressive PCEs of up to 4.59 % with reduced bandgap (ca . 0.2 eV) in comparison with that of PCDTBT . However , the multiple synthetic steps for the ladder - type PCDTBTs have restricted the realization for their usage in BHJ devices . Herein , we present an easily obtainable selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , poly(2,7 - carbazole - alt - diselenienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDSeBT) by replacing thiophenes with selenophene rings in the polymer backbone . Such a structural modification would be expected the lower - lying LUMO with the HOMO being largely unaffected due to the individual effects of the smaller ionization potential (IP) and almost the same electronegativity of selenium relative to sulfur atom . 10 In addition , interchain - charge transfer should be facilitated by intermolecular Se ° ° ° Se contacts , most likely leading to a widen absorption band and enhanced mobility that are desirable for high photocurrents . 11 Our preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic properties of PCDSeBT in typical BHJ devices with [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) shows a highly respectrable PCE of 4.12 % on account of the high J SC and V OC . The synthetic routes to the monomers (M1 and M2) and PCDSeBT are shown in Scheme 1 . Compounds 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were synthesized according to the previously reported procedures . 5a,12 The diboronic ester monomer M1 was easily synthesized from precursor 3 , by dilithiation at -78 ° C , followed by quenching with 2 - iso - propoxy-4,4,5,5 - tetrametyl-1,3,2 - dioxaborolane in anhydrous THF in a yield of 79 % .",

The electrochemical properties of PCDSeBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) . As shown in Figure 1b , PCDSeBT exhibits clear reversible n - doping / dedoping processes in the negative potential range , whereas quasi - reversible p - doping / dedoping behaviors in the positive potential range are observed . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be -5.40 eV and -3.70 eV , respectively , using the ferrocene - ferrocenium (Fc / Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) . Both PCDTBT and PCDSeBT have nearly identical HOMO energy levels , but PCDSeBT exhibits 0.10 eV lower - lying LUMO level relative to PCDTBT (LUMO = -3.60 eV , see also Supporting Information) , 5a verifying our presumption aforementioned about the effect of selenium on the selective fine - tuning of LUMO level . The material - design rules described by Scharber et al . 19 suggested that the PCEs of a BHJ solar cell should be much more sensitive to changes of the donor LUMO level compared to variations of the donor bandgap . On the basis of the rules , the estimated PCE from the E g opt and the LUMO value of PCDSeBT is 7.8 % . This theoretical value is much higher than that of PCDTBT (6.5 %) , indicating that a highly promising material for PSCs considering the frontier orbital energies . Upon utilizing a model dimeric system containing methyl groups , the optimized molecular geometry of PCDSeBT and its frontier molecular orbitals of the calculated HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces were computed by density functional theory (DFT , B3LYP / 6 - 31 G) (Figure 1d) . The HOMO of PCDSeBT is well - distributed along the conjugated chains ; its LUMO is mainly centralized on BT accepting core as shaped by orbital lobes , being predicted a p - type organic semiconductor . In order to corroborate the effect of the heteroatom substitution on charge transporting properties of the polymers , top - contact organic field - effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated using solution processed PCDTBT and PCDSeBT , respectively , as the semiconducting layer on the octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self - assembled monolayer (SAM)-modified Si / SiO 2 substrates (see the detailed devices fabrication in the Experimental Section) .",

I ds = (W / 2L) × μ × C i (V gs - V th) The OFET device using as - cast PCDTBT films without thermal annealing exhibits a hole mobility of 2.2 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 / V ° s with an on / off current ratio (I on / I off) of 4.44 × 10 ^ 3 . For PCDTBT thin films after annealing at evaluated temperatures , the mobilities are not markedly improved , implying that the PCDTBT thin films remain nearly amorphous for both as - cast and annealing at high temperature . On the other hand , it is found that the unannealed thin films of PCDSeBT exhibit a slightly higher mobility of μ h = 5.1 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 / V ° s , compared with that of pristine PCDTBT . Interestingly , in contrast , as the PCDSeBT thin films are annealed at a temperature of 120 and 150 ° C , the mobilities are systematically improved up to 1.0 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 / V ° s (Figure 2b) , which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of PCDTBT , possibly due to increased interpolymer chain contact induced by Se ° ° ° Se interactions with the thermal annealing process . To gain a better understanding of the influence of the thermal annealing , the crystallinity and molecular organization of PCDTBT and PCDSeBT thin films were investigated by Xray diffraction (XRD) , both before and after annealing at 150 ° C . Both the as - cast and annealed PCDTBT thin films fail to reveal any defined scattering patterns (Figure 3a) , indicating the macroscopically disordered , amorphous structure . In the case of PCDSeBT , the as - cast thin films show very weak diffractions (Figure 3b) . Upon thermal annealing , the primary peak at 4.42 ° , corresponding to a d - spacing of 19.99 Å , progressively intensifies and the secondary broad peak at ∼ 21.1 ° (d = 4.21 Å) that is probably related to π - π stacking becomes visible (Figure 3b) . On the basis of these XRD results , we can conclude that the oriented microstructure of the as - cast PCDSeBT thin films is kinetically limited but the polymer chains reorganize to ordered lamellar packing structures upon annealing . This observation is a plausible explanation for the sudden rise in mobility of PCDSeBT as a function of the thermal annealing .",

We can conclude that the formation of crystalline nanoscale domains would be slightly induced in PCDSeBT : PC71BM with a thermal treatment in consequence of the ordered crystalline nature of the PCDSeBT on annealing as supported by the XRD results above as well as the large quinoidal character in the polymer backbone as the inclusion of selenophene . 23 The AFM of the annealed film gives an evidence for slightly nanofibril - like organization (see Figure 5b) .

All of the polymers studied were found to exhibit good thermal stability , losing less than 5 % of their weight upon heating to approximately 350 ° C.

Matching the absorption of the conjugated polymer to the solar spectrum determines the ultimate performance of the solar cell . Among the variety of conjugated polymers that have been studied , poly(p - phenylenevinylene) (PPV) , 2 poly(alkylfluorene) (PF) , and polythiophene (PT) 3 derivatives are typical p - type electron donor materials . However , the performance of photovoltaic cells with these polymers is limited by their relatively large band gap energies , which are not yet optimized with respect to the solar spectrum . Therefore , the design and synthesis of new low - band gap polymers become very important to better harvest the solar spectrum , especially in the red and near - infrared ranges , which can lead to possible enhancements in the photocurrents of OPVs . 4 The most widely used approach for obtaining low - band gap structures is to utilize internal charge transfer (ICT) from an electron - donating to an electron - accepting moiety . 5 - 7 Some interesting structures using the ICT approach have been reported .",

Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using PFDTBT , PFD2TBT and the ter - polymers as p - type electron donors and by using [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an n - type acceptor . Two different types of photovoltaic devices were fabricated and characterized , with the device structures of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al and ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al shown in Figure 6 . The solutionprocessable titanium suboxide (TiO x) layer was employed as an optical spacer 30,31 and as a hole blocker 27 between the bulk heterojunction(BHJ) layer and the top metal electrode . Figure 7 shows the current - voltage (J - V) characteristics of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices . It can be observed that the open circuit voltages of cells fabricated using PFDTBT and its ter - polymers range from 0.70 to 0.77 V. The device fabricated using PFDTBT showed higher open circuit voltages than those of perylene - containing copolymers . This coincides with the relative HOMO energy levels of the polymers . As the perylene content in the copolymers increased , the amount of DTBT contents decreased , and so the HOMO of the polymers moved to higher energy levels . PFDTBT has the deepest HOMO energy level , thus it showed the highest open circuit voltage (0.77 V) .",

      "text": "It is also noteworthy that , the short circuit current of the devices increased with an increase in the number of perylene units in the polymer , except for the case of PFDTBT_20Per . Even though PFDTBT_20Per showed the highest hole mobility among the PFDTBT - based copolymers , it is UV - visible absorption spectrum showed greater blue - shifting than PFDTBT , as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , and it showed the widest band gap energy among all of the polymers considered herein . This may be why the short circuit current of the device fabricated using PFDTBT_20Per is lower than that of PFDTBT , despite it higher mobility . The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the best photovoltaic performance among the PFDTBT - based polymers (V oc = 0.74 V , J sc = 7.19 mA / cm^2 , PCE = 2.16 %) . For the photovoltaic devices fabricated using PFD2TBT - based polymers , the shortcircuit currents of the devices also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased ; however , the PCEs of the devices using PFD2TBT - based polymers were lower than those of PFDTBT - based polymers because of lower open - circuit voltages and short - circuit currents . The device fabricated using PFD2TBT_10Per showed the highest PCE (1.51 %) among the PFD2TBT - based polymers . The characteristics of the ITO / 4 . Figure 8 shows that the J - V characteristics of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices provide a similar trend to those of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices but their PCEs increased mainly due to increased short circuit currents . The increase in the short circuit current originates from the introduction of the thin titanium suboxide (TiO x) layer (ca . ∼ 10 nm) . The titanium suboxide layer could block holes to the aluminum electrode , thus it could increase the short circuit current of the photovoltaic device . The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the highest PCE of 3.16 % with an open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , a short circuit current of 9.61 mA / cm^2 and the highest fill factor (0.41) among the fabricated devices . The characteristics of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices are summarized in Table 5 . Figure 9 shows the incident photon - to - current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PFDTBT-10Per + PC71BM / LiF and TiO x / Al devices . The absorption onset corresponding to the photon - to - current conversion efficiency was about 750 nm for these devices , and the absorption onset values corresponding to the maximum conversion efficiency values were 427 and 560 nm . The morphologies of the polymers and PC71BM blend films were observed by tapping - mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) .",

This is the first report on spirobifluorene - based conjugated polymers used for polymer solar cells , demonstrating the great potential of spirobifluorene moiety as an electron - donating unit for the construction of main chain donor - acceptor alternating conjugated polymers for high performance polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells (PSCs) , as the most promising sustainable energy source alternative to inorganic - based solar cells , have received intensive attention in both academia and industry in recent years . 1 In comparison with inorganic solar cells , PSCs have the potential advantages of lightweight , flexibility , and manufacturing by low cost roll - to - roll process . 2 Up to date , bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure , in which the active layer consists of an interpenetrating blend of electron donating conjugated polymers and electron accepting fullerene derivatives , is still the most useful active layer structure for high power conversion efficiency (PCE) polymer solar cells . 1,3 Intensive researches worldwide on polymer design and device fabrication have led to a rapid development in the field of PSCs . 1,4 Recently , power conversion efficiency higher than 7 % for BHJ polymer solar cells has been achieved by several groups through the developing of new polymer donor materials with the use of [6,6]-phenyl - C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as electron acceptors . 4a - i For the designing high power conversion efficiency donor polymers , the following three points should be considered : 5 (1) the polymer should have appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels for harvesting as more photons as possible from solar radiation ; 5b (2) the polymer / PCBM blend films should have high and balanced carrier mobility for generating more free charge carriers and efficiently collecting them at corresponding electrodes ; 6 (3) the polymer should be soluble in common organic solvent for solution processing . 7 Main chain donor - acceptor alternating design is a very efficient way to engineer the band gap of conjugated polymers through the internal charge transfer from donor to acceptor unit .",

In the past few years , spirobifluorene has been used as an ideal building block in construction of stable blue light - emitting materials . 11 In the spiro - annulated molecules , the two perpendicular conjugated moieties are connected with the sp 3 -hybridized carbon atom as the spiro center . This structural feature can minimize the extravagant aggregation of polymers containing spiro - annulated molecules and thus can improve their solubility and processability . 11,12 Furthermore , the spirobifluorene structure can prevent the possible photo / thermal oxidation of the 9 - position of the fluorene unit to form the undesired low energy ketonic defect . 13 In theory , stable polymer structures are beneficial for the long lifetime of polymer solar cells . Here , we demonstrate for the first time that spirobifluorene can be a very useful building block to construct main chain donor - acceptor alternating conjugated polymer , poly[2,7-(3′,6′-dioctyloxy)-9,9′-spirobifluorene - alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2 - thienyl-5′,6′-dioctyloxy-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) ] (PSFDTBT) as shown in Scheme 1 , for high efficiency polymer solar cells . The octyloxy chains on spirobifluorene and 2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole units can provide PSFDTBT with good solubility in common organic solvents . The transport properties of the polymer are investigated by fabricating organic thin film field - effect transistors (OFETs) . The pristine PSFDTBT film spin - cast from DCB solution exhibited hole mobility of 7.26 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10 ^ 5 . The PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films show hole mobility of 1.14 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and an electron mobility of 2.7 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 .

The devices illustrate a considerably high V oc of 0.94 V , a J sc of 8.0 mA / cm^2 , and a comparable fill factor (FF) of 0.60 . All device measurements were conducted in air without any encapsulation . Noticeably , PSFDTBT exhibits significantly improved PSC performance when compares with the analogous 9,9 - dialkyl-9H - fluorene based polymer P1 (Scheme 1) , which showed general PSC performance with PCE of about 3.1 % in our previous report .",

Because of the threedimensional structure of spirobifluorene units , PSFDTBT is readily dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform , chlorobenzene , toluene , THF , 1,2 - dichlorobenzene (DCB) , 1,2,4 - trichlorobenzene (TCB) , etc . at room temperature . Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that PSFDTBT is of good thermal stability with less than 5 % weight loss up to 340 ° C. No clear glass transition was observed from 25 to 300 ° C in its DSC curves of the second heating and cooling runs (20 ° C / min) . Optical and Electrochemical Properties . UV - vis absorption spectra of PSFDTBT in THF solution and in film are shown in Figure 1 . In THF solution , PSFDTBT exhibited a broad absorption in the range of ultraviolet to visible region with two peaks located at 395 and 527 nm , respectively . In film , the absorption of PSFDTBT became broader and slightly redshifted with two peaks located at 401 and 562 nm , respectively . In comparison with the absorption spectrum in solution , the absorption spectrum in film became broader and red - shifted for about 35 nm , indicating the aggregation or ordered packing of polymer chains in solid state . Ordered packing of polymer chains is beneficial for improving the charge mobility of resulting films . 14 The optical absorption onset of PSFDTBT film is at 629 nm , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.97 eV. PC71BM was chosen as the acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PC61BM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region with a broad peak from 440 to 530 nm , which compensates the absorption valley of the polymer . 15 As shown in Figure 1 , the PSFDTBT / PC71BM blending film (1 : 3 by weight) has a strong absorption over a broad wavelength range of 400 ^ -700 nm . The electrochemical properties of PSFDTBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) . The HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT was determined to be -5.40 eV according to the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71) (eV) , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential in volts vs Ag / Ag + . 16 Since the open circuit voltage V oc of BHJ PSCs is correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , 5,17 therefore a higher V oc for PSFDTBT based polymer solar cells is anticipated due to the low - lying HOMO energy level .",

Such high V oc of almost 1 V is consistent with the low - lying HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT . In comparison with the device performance of P1 based PSCs , 8 devices based on PSFDTBT exhibited almost identical V oc , but higher J sc and much higher FF . As shown in Table 1 , the optimized devices based on P1 showed a PCE of 3.1 % with a V oc of 0.97 V , a J sc of 6.7 mA / cm^2 , and an FF = 0.47 . It is well - known that the processing solvent can dramatically affect the morphology of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance of devices .

In the case of polymers , extremely limited results have been reported . 21,22 In the Takimiya group , recently , a polymer composed of QC derivatives has been reported for use in OTFTs that has a high hole mobility (0.2 cm^2 V -1 S^-1) . 23 In this study , we synthesized a new donor - acceptor type (D- A type) polymer , poly[quinacridone - alt - octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole] (PQCDTB) , which contained QC and octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTB) . As a result , it is most likely that a broad absorbance could be obtained as the results of the effective charge transport and the strong electron - withdrawing caused by the high coplanarity . Table 1 shows the result of the molecular weight and the thermal properties of the obtained PQCDTB . As shown in this table , when the GPC was measured using polystyrene as the standard , the number - average molecular weights (M n) of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were 49.8 and 15.2 kg / mol , respectively . In contrast , the polydispersity indices (PDIs) showed a very narrow distribution of 1.92 and 1.77 , respectively . In terms of the degree of polymerization , PQCDTB was greater than other OPV polymers by 2 - 3 times because of the introduction of long , branched side chains of quinacridone and benzothiadiazole . As a result , the backbone structure became relatively favorable in terms of the solubility at polymerization ; polymerization had effectively occurred . 6 Table 1 showed the result of the thermal analysis through TGA . As shown in Table 1 , PQCDTB and PCZDTB had a 5 % weight loss at the temperatures of 323 and 324 ° C , respectively , displaying a high thermal stability because of the rigid QC and carbazole structure , which is applicable for optoelectronic devices and OPVs , both of which require a high thermal stability (300 ° C or above) . 24 We investigated thermal behavior through DSC analysis (see Supporting Information) , which revealed no obvious thermal transitions for PQCDTB in the temperature range from 40 to 250 ° C.

      "text": "For the film , the maxima absorption spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were red - shifted by 9 - 23 nm compared with the solution . These results are explained by their much more planar conformations in the solid state . 10 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram of PCZDTB and PQCDTB , which were measured in 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate acetonitrile . As reported by Lidzey et al . , the PCZDTB oxidation (E ox onset) and reduction (E red onset) onset potential were + 1.09 and -1.37 V , respectively , and the HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.44 and -2.98 eV. In the case of PQCDTB , unlike the PQA2 T (poly[quinacridone - bithiophene] ) reported by Takimiya et al . , a clear oxidation - reduction peak was observed . 19 This type of result has been obtained because PQCDTB was D - A structured , unlike the typical p - type structure of PQA2T. In PQCDTB , the oxidation (E ox onset) and reduction (E red onset) onset potentials were + 0.89 and -1.36 V , respectively . The HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.24 and -2.99 eV , respectively . Table 2 summarizes the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers . As shown in Table 2 , the HOMO level of PQCDTB (-5.24 eV) was higher than that of PCZDTB by 0.2 eV because the HOMO level of the QC derivative was higher than that of carbazole . The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference between the HOMO energy levels and the optical bandgap energies . According to the calculations , the LUMO levels of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were -3.32 and -3.46 eV , respectively . They slightly differed from the levels calculated through CV , but they mostly exhibited a similar tendency . Figure 4 shows the band diagram of the energy levels that have been obtained through DFT calculations and experiments . The bandgap energies of PQCDTB and PCZDTB determined through UV - vis spectra were reported as 1.98 and 1.92 eV , respectively , which were lower than the results of the DFT calculation by 0.57 and 0.55 V. 28 Because the HOMO level is lower than the P3HT HOMO level (-4.9 eV) in both polymers , a relatively high air stability could be obtained . 29 In the case of PQCDTB , the LUMO level (-3.32 eV) was higher than the PC71BM LUMO level (-4.0 eV) by 0.68 eV. However , the HOMO level (-5.24 eV) was lower than the PEDOT : PSS HOMO level (-5.0 eV) by 0.24 eV. Therefore , if charge separation occurs after receiving light energy , a hole would exhibit more effective charge transport than an electron in the active layer of PQCDTB . 14,26 Figure 5 and Table 3 show the results of evaluating the characteristics of an OPV device .",

In the device that blended the PQCDTB and PC71BM in a 1 : 1 ratio , V OC , J SC , and FF were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , and 55.8 % , respectively . In terms of PCE , approximately 56 % was improved with 2.5 % , compared with the device in which the PC61BM was applied as an acceptor . Because PC71BM is greater than PC61BM in terms of photon absorption at 400 - 500 nm , it was able to improve the PCE by increasing J SC . 6 The V oc of PQCDTB was greater than the widely known poly(3 - hexylthiophene) , P3HT (V oc = 0.5 - 0.6 V) . This type of result was obtained because PQCDTB (-5.53 eV) has a lower HOMO level than P3HT (-4.9 eV) . 19,24 The value of FF for PQCDTB (FF = 55.8 %) increased by 39 % compared to PCZDTB (FF = 40.1 %) .

In contrast , the series resistance at PCZDTB and PC71BM ratio of 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 was 320 , 62 Ω / cm^2 , respectively . The series resistance of PQCDTB exhibited low value compared to that of PCZDTB . The decrease of series resistance could increase FF . PQCDTB showed high FF than PCZDTB due to decrease of series resistance by self - organization of quinacridone unit . 9 Figure 5b showed the external quantum efficiency (EQE) data of the fabricated device . When PQCDTB was used as a donor and PC61BM and PC71BM were used as acceptors , the device had 38 % and 41 % EQE at 480 nm , respectively . The photovoltaic devices with PC71BM as an acceptor showed higher EQE values than those with PC61BM as an acceptor , although they absorbed photons in the same range of the solar spectra . This was because PC71BM has a stronger UV - vis absorption property than does PC61BM in the visible region , especially near 500 nm . 30 Hence , the PCE improved with an increase in J SC . In a device that used PCZDTB as a donor , an EQE of 48 % was observed at 440 nm . Interestingly , λ max was blue - shifted by -30 nm because of the low π - π stacking and the weak intermolecular interaction of PCZDTB compared with PQCDTB .",

      "text": "Significant progress has been made in synthesis of conjugated polymers and their applications for optoelectronic device such as organic light - emitting diodes (OLEDs) , organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) , and organic field - effect transistors (OFETs) since Heeger , MacDiarmid , and Shirakawa discovered conducting polymers in 1976.^1 As a result of the low - cost , light - weight , and flexibility advantages , optoelectronic devices based on conjugated polymers are a promising cost - effective alternative to inorganic materials - based microelectronics . Conjugated polymers can be classified as hole (p - type) or electron (n - type) transporting materials according to the type of orderly transferring charge carriers . Most of conjugated polymers are p - type semiconductors that have seen a dramatic rise in performance over the past decade while much less attention has been devoted to n - type semiconducting polymers that have lagged behind their p - type counterparts . 2 Organic n - type materials are essential for the fabrication of organic p - n junctions , OPVs , n - channel OFETs , OLEDs , and complementary logic circuits . 3 The n - type building blocks are the core components in n - type semiconducting polymers . Aromatic imides such as rylene diimides are one of the classical n - type building blocks and can exhibit relatively high electron affinities , high electron mobilities , and excellent chemical , thermal , and photochemical stabilities . 4 These materials are electron deficient due to the substitution of an aromatic core with one or two sets of π - accepting imide groups that are mutually conjugated . The widely used rylene diimides include perylene diimides (PDIs , 1) and naphthalene diimides (NDIs , 2) (Figure 1) . Zhan and co - workers reported the synthesis of the first soluble rylene - based fully conjugated polymer . 5 Top - gate OFETs based on this PDI- dithienothiophene copolymer exhibited a saturation electron mobility (μ e) of 6 x 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , current on / off ratio (I on / I off) of 10 ^ 4 , and a low threshold voltage (V th) of 7 V in air . 6 Moreover , all - polymer solar cells based on blends of polythiophene derivative donors and PDI - dithienothiophene copolymer acceptors exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 1.5 % (AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2) . 7 - 9 Facchetti et al . reported a conjugated copolymer of NDI and bithiophene ; 10 OFET devices based on this polymer fabricated in a top - gate , bottom - contact configuration with polymeric dielectrics exhibited μ e of 0.1 - 0.85 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 under ambient conditions with I on / I off > 10 ^ 5 . 11 The simplest aromatic imide system is phthalimide (3) and thiophene imide (4) (Figure 1) . A few literatures reported phthalimide - containing conjugated polymers such as poly-(phenylene ethynylene)s , 12 a polyaniline derivative , 13 and a polythiophene derivative .",

The combination of benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0] dithiophene planarity and efficient π - π stacking with the electron - withdrawing capacity of the imide functionality serves as the foundation for this new class of materials . Introduction of the π - electron - deficient imide moiety can decrease the HOMO and LUMO energies of the polymers , which is necessary for air - stable polymers . Furthermore , substitution at the imide nitrogen allows introduction of functionalities and solubility improvement with varying degrees of steric bulk while not impinging on critical intermolecular π - π stacking characteristics . This motif also leaves the benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0] dithiophene 2 - and 7 - positions available for polymerization . Finally , the dipole moment caused by the imide could stabilize cofacial antiparallel intra - and interchain repeat unit orientations , planarize the backbone , and promote π - π stacking . 27 On the basis of this new building block , we designed and synthesized a series of conjugated copolymers : unit 8 coupled with electron - rich unit benzo[1,2b:4,5 - b 0] dithiophene (P1 and P2) or with electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole (P3 and P4) or benzo [c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole (P5) and homopolymer (P6) (Figure 2) . The optical properties and electronic structure (HOMO / LUMO levels and bandgap) can be manipulated through adjusting copolymerized building blocks . ' RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization . The synthetic routes to the monomers and polymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2 . We chose very cheap , industrial product maleic anhydride as a starting material . Bromination of maleic anhydride with Br 2 gave its dibromide (1) . 41 Then , amination with alkylamine afforded the alkyl - substituted 3,4dibromopyrrole-2,5 - dione (2a , b) . Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide 2a , b with 3 - thienylboronic acid gave 3,4 - bis(3 - thienyl)pyrrole-2,5 - dione (3a , b) . The large sulfur - containing polycyclic aromatic imides , dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide (4a , b) , were synthesized through iron(III) chloride - mediated oxidative cyclization , which is a general strategy for ring closure . 42 Bromination of 4a , b with Br 2 gave rise to the monomers 5a , b. Stille coupling reaction of 5a with tributyl(thiophen-2 - yl)stannane afforded 2,7 - bis(2 - thienyl)-dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide (6a) , which was brominated with NBS to afford monomer 7a . Copolymers P1 - P4 were synthesized through Stille coupling reaction of the dibromide monomers 5a , b or 7a with benzodithiophene-2,6 - ditin or 2,2 0 -bithiazole-5,5 0 -ditin , while P5 was synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide monomer 5b with benzothiadiazole-4,7 - diboronic ester . Homopolymer P6 was synthesized by palladium - catalyzed homocoupling of the dibromide 5b in the presence of hexabutylditin . P1 with three solubilizing n - dodecyl groups has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , THF , and toluene .",

The combination of the different electron - deficient units of pyrrolo [3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione (DPP) and thieno [3,4- c]pyrrole-4,6 - dione (TPD) can be ideal for producing broad light absorption due to the large difference between their electron - withdrawing strengths . 19,22 In addition , both units have been successfully used in D - A copolymers to produce high - performance PSCs . 26 - 33 While electron - withdrawing TPD possesses a relatively simple , symmetric , and planar structure suitable for D - A copolymers in PSCs , DPP exhibits very strong electron - withdrawing effect due to the presence of electrondeficient lactam rings and strong π - π interactions . 19,34 Herein , we report a series of novel random poly[thienyl - substituted benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene - pyrrolo [3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4dione - thieno [3,4 - c]pyrrole-4,6 - dione]copolymers (PBDTT- DPP - TPD) based on one electron - rich unit , thienylsubstituted benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene (BDTT) , and two electron - deficient units , DPP and TPD , that have complementary and broad light absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm . This is a much broader absorption than other reported random terpolymers , 23,24 endowing a great potential for improving the PSC performance and providing an ideal system for studying the compositional effect of the random terpolymers on the PSC performance . While the ratio of DPP to TPD influenced the optical behavior of the random terpolymers , the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the polymers showed a nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % . The best PCE value of 6.33 % was obtained from the blend device of PBDTT - DPP75 - TPD25 and [6,6]-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) , with a short - circuit current density (J SC) higher than 16 mA / cm^2 . To understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the PCE , the optical , electrical , and structural properties of these random terpolymers with different ratios of DPP to TPD were systematically investigated . stated , all of the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received . The weight - average molecular weight (M w) , number - average molecular weight (M n) , and polydispersity index (PDI) of P1- P7 were measured by SEC with o - dichlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 ° C. The characteristics of the polymers are summarized in Table 1 . To determine the actual ratio between DPP and TPD in the random terpolymers , they were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . The 1H NMR spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure S1 . The peak of the butyloctyl chains adjacent to the lactam N atom of DPP appeared around 4.09 ppm and the signal of the octyl chains adjacent to TPD appeared around 3.77 ppm .",

The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / LiF / Al , where the polymers (P1- P7) were used as electron donors and PC71BM (or PC61BM) was used as an electron acceptor . To optimize the morphology and ordering structure , different volume percentages of 1,8diiodooctane were added . 43 Figure 4 shows the current density versus voltage (J - V) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW / cm^2 . The V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE values of the PSC devices are summarized in Table 3 . From P1 to P4 , PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor , but for P5 , P6 , and P7 , PC61BM was used as the electron acceptor . P5 , P6 , and P7 blended with PC61BM showed higher PCE values than when they were blended with PC71BM in spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , which is most likely due to the lower miscibility of those polymers with PC71BM . 44 The V OC of these random terpolymers increased in the order P2 (0.74 V) ∼ P3 (0.74 V) < P4 (0.76 V) < P5 (0.79 V) < P6 (0.82 V) . The trend in the V OC of the PSCs can be explained by the HOMO energy level of the polymers because the V OC is typically linearly proportional to the difference in energy between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor . 45 However , the PCE of the random terpolymers showed a the nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % in the order P3 (5.61 %) > P4 (5.26 %) > P2 (4.91 %) > P5 (3.02 %) > P6 (2.09 %) ; this was consistent with the observed trend of the J SC . P3 exhibited the highest PCE value of 5.61 % among all polymers , including P1 and P7 , which was attributed to the broad absorption and increased V OC due to the deeper HOMO energy level .",

In contrast , the PCE suddenly decreased in the blended device of P5 and PC61BM (3.02 %) and further decreased in P6 (2.09 %) , mainly due to the significant decrease of the J SC . The low J SC values of P5 and P6 were unexpected , considering the lower band gaps of P5 (1.49 eV) and P6 (1.55 eV) compared to that of P7 (1.85 eV) . To better understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC values , the space - chargelimited current (SCLC) of hole - only devices of the P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 blended devices were measured and compared (Figure S5) . The hole - only devices were constructed under optimized device conditions with the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / blends / Au . The hole mobilities of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 were 1.14 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.13 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.09 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.10 × 10 ^ -4 , and 1.18 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 / (V s) , respectively , showing that the hole mobilities of all random terpolymers were similar to or 1 order of magnitude higher than their parent polymers . Therefore , the trend of the J SC can not be explained solely by the changes in the optical properties and the hole mobilities . To gain a better understanding of the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC and PCE values of the PBDTT- DPP - TPD random terpolymers , the molecular geometries and the electron density distribution were simulated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP / 6 - 31G(d , p) level with the Spartan 08 software package . Three repeating units were taken as a model for calculations , and methyl was used instead of the long side chains to reduce the computational time . Four model compounds , (BDTT - DPP) 3 , (BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP) , (BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD) , and (BDTT - TPD) 3 were used and calculated for comparison . The optimized molecular geometries of the models and their calculated HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals are depicted in Figure 5 and Figure S7 . In general , for alternative copolymers , the electron density in the HOMO wave functions is well delocalized . However , the LUMO wave function shows a different degree of localization in the electron density dependent on the types of the electron - withdrawing units . 46,47 This tendency was observed in (BDTT - DPP) 3 and (BDTT - TPD) 3 .",

      "text": "Because the lamellar spacing in P1 (19.2 Å) was smaller than in P7 (24.1 Å) , the length of the side chains in BDTT is not the main factor in determining the lamellar spacing in P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 ; the lamellar spacing is mainly determined by the length of the side chains in DPP and TPD . As more TPD was introduced into the polymer backbone , the domain spacing of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 gradually increased from 19.2 , 20.1 , 21.9 , 22.7 to 24.1 Å , respectively . This is likely due to the increased amount of structurally longer alkyl side chains of TPD . Figure S8 shows that the pristine polymers exhibited a distinctive arc scattering of the (010) peak along the out - of - plane direction at q = 1.62- 1.68 Å -1 , corresponding to π - π stacking . The π - π stacking is more prominent in the out - of - plane direction , which suggests that most of the polymer backbones are oriented parallel to the substrates . The π - π stacking distances of polymers were 3.85 , 3.86 , 3.84 , 3.85 , and 3.74 Å for P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 , respectively . The combination effects of the DPP to TPD ratio with changes in the alkyl chain could affect the π - π stacking distance of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 and backbone planarity , thus influencing their charge transport properties . The π - π stacking feature of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 in the blended films was significantly changed by the addition of PCBM , as shown in Figure 6 . No π - π stacking diffraction was observed in P1 , P3 , and P4 , and only a faint π - π stacking diffraction pattern in the out - of - plane direction appeared for P5 . However , P7 had a prominent π - π stacking peak even after the addition of PCBM , indicating that the polymer backbone adopts a preferential \" face - on \" orientation relative to the substrate . In spite of the \" face - on \" orientation of P7 , its mobility was observed to be slightly lower compared to the other polymers , which is most likely due to the presence of fewer percolating pathways for hole transport . 54 Therefore , the GIXS patterns revealed that the incorporation of the different units of DPP and TPD affects the polymeric ordering (i.e. , domain spacing) as well as its direction . For further characterization , the BHJ morphology of the polymer blends was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) . The resulting AFM and TEM images are shown in Figure 7 and Figure S9 , respectively . The images of P1 , P3 , P4 , and P5 blends showed bicontinuous structures of polymer and PCBM as well as small - scale phase separation favorable for exciton dissociation .",

On the basis of the above consideration , herein , we designed and synthesized two new D - A copolymers PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO (Scheme 1) based on zNDT flanked with two thiophene units as donor unit and BT or BO as acceptor unit .

The PSCs based on PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than that based on PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM .

The weak electron - donating characteristic of TA , which has 2 - D extended conjugation by thiophene side groups , makes the copolymer exhibit a low - lying HOMO level of -5.5 eV with a low band - gap of 1.65 eV , which affords both high photo - voltage and photocurrent of the polymer solar cells . As a result , the solar cell device fabricated from the blend of the copolymer and PC71BM exhibits a promising power conversion efficiency of 7.02 % (V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 13.1 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.67) . Moreover , the polymer solar cell as fabricated from the blend of the copolymer and di - perylene bisimide (di - PBI) as a non - fullerene electron acceptor exhibits a promising power conversion efficiency of 4.23 % with V OC = 0.77 V , J SC = 9.8 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.56 . This photovoltaic performance of the copolymer not only demonstrates that the TA is a promising electron - donating building block for a high performance low band - gap copolymer , but also the copolymer is compatible with both PC71BM and a non - fullerene acceptor for high efficiency polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have important advantages over inorganic - based solar cells such as low material - cost , ease of fabrication with low processing - cost and the potential for fabrication of large area and flexible solar cells . 1 In the last decade , remarkable progress in the performance of PSCs has been achieved by introducing a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure in the active layer . [2][3][4][5] It has also been demonstrated that low band - gap conjugated polymers with broad absorption of the solar spectrum are promising active layer materials to achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) . 6,7 Hence , an effective approach to achieve a high PCE of PSC is to design and synthesize high performance conjugated polymers . [8][9][10][11] In recent efforts to develop high performance conjugated polymers , building blocks have been carefully designed for the conjugated polymers to have adequate energy levels , broad light absorption and strong self - assembly for use in BHJ PSC . [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] As one of the most promising building blocks for constructing low band - gap conjugated polymers , diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has emerged as the desirable electron - withdrawing moiety . 19,20 Over the past five years , a variety of conjugated polymers containing DPP have been investigated as promising semiconductors for application in organic optoelectronics such as field effect transistors , memory devices and PSCs . Indeed , DPP - based conjugated polymers have achieved impressive PCEs up to 9 % by the combination of DPP and various electron - donating building blocks .",

The energy levels of the copolymers are lower than those of other heteroarene - based DPP copolymers reported previously , [21][22][23][24][25][26] and their low - lying HOMO energy levels are expected to afford high V OC s of the polymer solar cells . The crystal properties of the copolymers were investigated by X - ray diffraction (XRD) . The two copolymers clearly showed a characteristic diffraction peak in the range of 3 - 5 ° with a weak diffraction peak in the range of 15 - 20 ° which are associated with (100) and (010) diffraction , respectively (Fig . 2a) , indicating that both copolymers form a crystalline lamellar structure in the thin film state . It should be noted here that these copolymers exhibit distinct X - ray diffraction without any thermal treatment . Both copolymers exhibit a sharp and intense (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.2 ° corresponding to the interchain distance (d 100) of 21.0 Å , while the (010) diffraction peak was observed at 19.4 ° for PTATDPP and 19.1 ° for PTAFDPP , corresponding to the π - π stacking distance (d 010) of 4.6 Å and 4.7 Å , respectively . For identifying the reason for high crystallinity of the copolymers , the density functional theory (DFT) calculation for the minimum energy conformations of the copolymers was performed to reveal the difference of the dihedral angle between the TA and DPP units in the copolymers . To simplify the calculation , one repeating unit of each polymer was used as the model compound , and long alkyl substituents were replaced by the ethyl group . As shown in Fig . 2b , TA and TDPP have a coplanar structure with a dihedral angle smaller than 1 ° while TA and FDPP have a slightly distorted structure with a dihedral angle of 3.8 ° . This difference of the dihedral angle between PTATDPP and PTAFDPP accounts for the difference of d 010 , and thus , PTATDPP is expected to form a more closely - packed lamellar structure than PTAFDPP . To investigate the charge transporting characteristics of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP , bottom - gate and top - contact fieldeffect transistors (FETs) were fabricated . Both copolymers clearly exhibit current modulation and saturation with unipolar p - type field - effect charge transporting behavior , as shown in Fig . 3 . The calculated saturation hole mobilities (μ h) for PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are 2.7 × 10 ^ -2 and 8.9 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , with high on / off ratios (> 10 ^ 5) and low threshold voltages (< 20 V) .",

      "text": "This result leads us to conclude that PTATDPP retains a higher crystalline nature in the blend with PC71BM , affording a better hole transporting pathway and thus exhibiting a higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP . When the morphologies of active layers were observed by transmission electron microscopy , the PTATDPP : PC71BM blend shows clearly a fibril nanostructure (fibril width ∼ 30 nm) with the formation of a bi - continuous network , whereas the PTAFDPP : PC71BM blend shows a phase - separated morphology without the formation of distinct nanostructures , as shown in Fig . 5 . It is well recognized that the nanoscale phase separation with a fibril structure is favourable for an efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport which are the prerequisites for high J SC and FF of PSCs . Therefore , the high FF (0.68) of PTATDPP - based device arises mainly from the efficient charge - carrier mobility and the formation of a nanoscale fibril structure of PTATDPP . To further evaluate the potential of PTATDPP as an electron donor material for PSCs , we fabricated a non - fullerene PSC device by blending PTATDPP with a non - fullerene small molecular electron acceptor , 2,2′9,9′-tetra(undecan-6 - yl)- [5,5′bianthra (2,1,9 - def:6,5,10 - d′e′f′)diisoquinolin]-1,1′,3,3′,8,8′,10,10′- (2H,2′H,9H,9′H)-octaone (di - PBI) . 38 As can be seen in Fig . 6a , PTATDPP and di - PBI have well - matched energy levels with a LUMO - LUMO offset of 0.4 eV , 39 which is enough for exciton dissociation , and also exhibit complementary absorption , i.e. , di - PDI and PTATDPP absorb 400 - 600 nm and 600 - 800 nm , respectively . As a consequence , the blend film (1 : 2 in weight ratio) exhibits a broad light absorption from 400 to 800 nm . The compatibility of PTATDPP and di - PBI as an electron donor and an acceptor , respectively , was also examined by monitoring the photoluminescence (PL) quenching of each compound in the blend film . As shown in Fig . 6c , the blend film shows excellent PL quenching over 95 % of each PL from PTATDPP and di - PBI , indicating that photogenerated excitons from both PTATDPP and di - PBI are readily dissociated into free carriers at the interface of two materials . The non - fullerene PSC fabricated from the blend of PTATDPP and di - PBI exhibits a PCE of 4.23 % with V OC = 0.77 V , J SC = 9.8 mA cm^-2 and FF = 0.56 (Fig . 7) . Interestingly , the blend morphology of PTATDPP and di - PDI as observed from atomic force microscopy (AFM) and TEM reveals that PTATDPP forms a well - developed interconnected BHJ morphology with a fibrillar nanostructure (Fig . S4 and S5 †) . This fibril morphology affords the effective exciton dissociation as observed from the PL quenching experiment .",

We have designed and synthesized two anthracene - based low band - gap copolymers , PTATDPP and PTAFDPP .

Using PBDT - TDPP - S as electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as electron acceptor , the resulting polymer solar cells exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a power conversion efficiency of 4.89 % , an open - circuit voltage of 0.84 V , a short - circuit current of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor of 56.0 % . Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention because of their potential for achieving large - area , flexible photovoltaic devices through lowcost solution processing techniques . 1 To date , solar power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 10.6 % and 9.2 % have been demonstrated in the cells with tandem and single junction structures , respectively , representing an important advance in the development of PSCs . 2 Many recent research efforts have been concentrated on the development of donor - acceptor (D - A) narrow band gap (NBG) polymers with broad absorption spectra . 3 Despite the great success of these D - A polymers in achieving high performance PSCs , further development of novel electron donor polymers is still in urgent need as the donor polymers play a decisive role in determining the device performance . Nowadays , most of the present polymers are in main - chain D - A frame , which may suffer from lower hole mobility due to the influence of acceptor units in the main chain . Aiming at investigating the effects of the D - A framework on device performance , Huang and co - workers proposed a new molecular design strategy toward side - chain D - A conjugated polymers , in which D moieties were employed to construct the main chain and A units were conjugatedly pended onto the D units in the side chain . 4 Compared to the corresponding main - chain D - A polymers , the side - chain ones mainly possesses three advantages . First , the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) energy levels of the side - chain polymers can preserve in a deeper position . Second , a two - dimensional - like structural feature renders this class of polymers with better solubility . Finally , there exists an internal charge transfer (ICT) behavior from the side - chain D - A structure , which can fine - tune the band gap (E g) of the resultant polymers as well as promote an isotropic charge transport along the polymeric main chain . As a result of these merits , PSCs based on these previously reported side - chain D - A polymers exhibited a maximal PCE of 4.74 % .",

The first one at ∼ 420 nm corresponds to the π - π * transition of the polymeric backbone in short wavelength region . The second one at ∼ 590 nm in long wavelength region is attributed to the ICT interaction between the donor unit in the main chain and the acceptor unit at the side chain . Compared with the absorption spectrum in DCM solution , the one in solid film displayed a red - shift absorption peak at 602 nm and an additional shoulder at 655 nm besides the highenergy peak . The extended absorption edge in long wavelength region can be attributed to the more aggregated configuration formed in solid state . Compared to the main - chain copolymer of PBDTDPP - OR reported by the Jo group , this side - chain copolymer of PBDT - TDPP - S exhibited a 100 nm blue - shifted maximum absorption peak . The observed blue - shifted absorption phenomenon should be related to the less planar conformation and weaker D - A interaction for the side - chain D - A copolymer than the main - chain D - A copolymer . As a result , the optical band gap (E g opt) of PBDT - TDPP - S was shifted to 1.73 eV as calculated from the onset of absorption spectra in the solid film . 2.3 . Electrochemical Properties . The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of the PBDT - TDPP - S film coated on a platinum electrode is shown in Figure S3 (see Supporting Information) , and the electrochemical data are also summarized in Table 2 . An onset oxidation potential of 0.94 V and an onset reduction potential of -0.88 V (vs SCE) are observed . Based on an empirical formula , the corresponding HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (E HOMO and E LUMO) of PBDT - TDPP - S were calculated to be -5.34 and -3.52 eV , respectively . This resulting E HOMO level is lower than those of the reported mainchain D - A copolymers of PDPP - BDT (-5.16 eV) and PBDTPP - OR (-5.29 eV) . 8 The relatively low E HOMO for PBDT - TDPP - S is beneficial to achieve high V OC in PSCs , given the strong correlation between the V OC and the difference between the E HOMO of donor and the E LUMO of acceptor in PSCs . 8 2.4 .

Device parameters , such as J SC , V OC , FF , and PCE are deduced from the J - V characteristics and summarized in Table 3 . It is clear that the PBDT - TDPP - S : PC71BM - based devices exhibited better photovoltaic properties as compared to the PBDT - TDPP - S : PC61BM - based devices , which can be attributed to the stronger absorption of PC71BM than PC61BM in the visible region from 440 to 530 nm , as shown in Figure 1b .

The measured hole and electron mobility are listed in Table 4 . Such high and balanced hole - electron mobility for the PBDT - TDPP - S is responsible for the high FF level in the devices .

This level of thermal stability is adequate for applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices . Optical Properties . The absorption spectrum of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) in film is shown in Figure 2 together with that of P3HT and normalized AM 1.5 G photon flux for comparison . The polymer has a broad absorption band in the range of 500 - 1100 nm with a tail extending to 1.3 μm . The full width at half - maximum (fwhm) of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) film is 324 nm , which is nearly a double that of P3HT film (158 nm) . The optical band gap of the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) film is 1.13 eV , as estimated from the absorption onset (1100 nm) . All these data indicate that PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) can utilize a larger fraction of solar light that P3HT as a possible material for applications in micrometer response photovoltaic devices . Electrochemical Properties . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PDTP - DTDPP-(Bu) . The CV curves were recorded referenced to an Ag / Ag þ electrode , which was calibrated against the ferroceneferrocenium (Fc / Fc þ) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) ; the CV curves are shown in Figure 3 . On the basis of the onset values of oxidation (0.10 V) and reduction potential (-1.17 V) of the polymer , the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer were calculated as -4.90 and -3.63 eV , respectively . The electrochemical band gap thus determined is about 1.27 eV , which is slightly higher than the optical band gap . X - ray Diffraction (XRD) Measurements . The XRD patterns of the bulk samples of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH) were recorded to understand their structures in the solid state . As shown in Figure 4 , both samples show diffraction peaks at low angles , which could be attributed to a lamellar structure . The d - spacings of the diffraction from (100) are 14.8 and 14.9 Å for PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH) , respectively . The peaks around 24 ° for both polymers can be assigned to the face - to - face distance of the aromatic groups in the polymer chains arranged in the parallel direction . This π - π stacking distance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) was 3.64 Å , slightly lower than that of PDTP - DTDPP(EH) (3.74 Å) , which suggests that the butyl group in DPP segment is better for the close π - π stacking of the polymer backbones compared to the bulkier 2 - ethylhexyl group .

      "text": "11 The mobility of PDTP - DTDPP-(Bu) was measured by using a field - effect transistor (FET) with a bottom - gate , top - contact device configuration built on an n - doped silicon wafer . Figure 5 shows the typical output and transfer curves of a representative device with PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) as the channel semiconductor . The hole mobility was estimated to be 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of other effective D - A type low - bandgap photovoltaic polymers (2.6 x 10 ^ -4 -3 x 10 ^ -3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1) . 5 Although the FET mobility might not be directly correlated to the photovoltaic performance since the situation of the charge transport is quite different from each other , the higher carrier mobility still suggests effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes in the photovoltaic devices . Photovoltaic Properties . The bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PCBM (or PC 70 BM) / LiF / Al . PEDOT : PSS was spin - coated on a precleaned ITO - coated glass substrate . The film was dried at 150 ° C under a N 2 atmosphere for 5 min . After cooling the substrate , a solution of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM (or PC 70 BM) mixture (1 : 2 w / w) was spin - coated , where a blend of chloroform and o - dichlorobenzene (4 : 1 v / v) was used as the solvent . The devices were completed by evaporating LiF / Al as the cathode . The effective area (2 mm x 3 mm) of the PSCs was defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light (Scheme 2) . PC 70 BM was also used as an acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PCBM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region , which can compensate for the poor absorption of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) in this range . Figure 6 shows the I - V curves of the devices with the best photovoltaic performance under the illumination of AM 1.5 (100 mW / cm^2) . The corresponding open - circuit voltage (V OC) , short - circuit current (I SC) , fill factor (FF) , and PCE of the devices are also summarized in Figure 3 . The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices under the illumination of monochromatic light is shown in Figure 3 . Compared with the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PCBM system , the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PC 70 BM system has higher EQE values of 30 - 40 % in the range of 450 - 850 nm , which contributes to the improvement of I SC from 11.31 to 14.87 mA / cm^2 . Since the spectral response extends to over 1.1 μm , the spectral mismatch between the simulated and actual AM1.5 spectra must be considered .",

      "text": "We compared the experimental I SC under the simulated AM1.5 irradiation and the I SC calculated by integrating the EQE and the actual AM1.5 solar spectra . The calculated I SC from the EQE was 15 % less than the measured I SC . This discrepancy might be attributed to the spectral mismatch in the NIR region and / or device degradation during measurements in air . The highest PCE of PSCs based on the PDTP - DTDPP-(Bu) : PC 70 BM system reached 2.71 % , which was lower than the 4 - 5 % of the P3HT : PCBM devices . This could be mainly attributed to the lower V OC (∼ 0.4 V) . In addition , the charge separation efficiency in the current combination might not be as high as that in P3HT : PCBM , although it was difficult to estimate the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) accurately due to the light interference effect in the films . This might be attributed to the smaller LUMO offset or less ideal mixing morphology between the polymer and PCBM . Nevertheless , this performance is more than double of the highest PCE (1.1 %) reported to date for μmR - polymers , even when the spectral mismatch in the NIR region above was considered . Such improvement of PCE comes from relatively highefficiency photon - to - electron conversion in the broad range of the absorption in the blend film of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM . Considering the high EQE obtained in the range from 650 to 950 nm , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) is a promising candidate for applications in tandem photovoltaic devices in combination with conventional visible light absorbing materials . Furthermore , comparing the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) with PDTP - DTDPP(EH) suggests that the alkyl chain in the DPP segment has a large influence on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers . A similar phenomenon was also observed for other D - A type photovoltaic polymers . 12 Synthesis of new μmR - polymers with different alkyl chain in both the DTDPP segment and the dithieno[3,2 - b : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -d]pyrrole segment and a detailed comparison of the properties of all these polymers are now in progress . The energy loss from the low output voltage of the photovoltaic devices (0.38 - 0.4 V) can be attributed to the relatively large difference between the LUMO levels of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM (i.e. , small energy difference between the HOMO of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and LUMO of PCBM) . There is still a room to lower the LUMO level of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) from 3.63 to ∼ 4.0 eV , which is ∼ 0.3 eV higher than the LUMO level of PCBM . If we can control the mixing morphology suitable for the charge separation , this energy offset might be enough to maintain a sufficient driving force for charge transfer and the higher V OC could be expected at the same time .",

In conclusion , a highly effective photovoltaic polymer with NIR response , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) , based on alternating 3,6 - dithien-2 - yl-2 , 5 - dibutylpyrrolo[3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione units has been synthesized .
