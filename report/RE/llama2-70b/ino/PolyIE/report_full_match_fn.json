      "text": "By taking into consideration using low bandgap polymers to harvest more solar photons , researchers have devoted much effort recently to reducing the bandgap of polymers . This approach has provided a remarkable short - circuit current density ( J SC ) of 16 mA / cm^2 , 3 whereas , in general , the V OC has suffered 4 because of a higher than the HOMO optimal energy level in order to pursue a lower bandgap . In the PSCs community , poly(2,7 - carbazole - altdithienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDTBT ) is one excellent exam - ple for a low HOMO ( -5.45 eV ) as required by the ' ideal ' πconjugated polymers , which led to a high V OC value over 0.8 V and outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures . 5 The initial PCE reached 3.6 % 6 in a typical BHJ device and has been subsequently improved to exceeding 6 % by BHJ layer thickness optimization and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures . 7 However , the bandgap of PCDTBT is still relatively larger than the proposed 1.5 - 1.7 eV of the ideal polymers for PCEs exceeding 10 % . Recently , to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT without sacrificing its high V OC , Hsu et al . 8 and our group 9 independently reported PCDTBT - based ladder - type polymers with forced planarity of which device performance showed impressive PCEs of up to 4.59 % with reduced bandgap ( ca . 0.2 eV ) in comparison with that of PCDTBT . However , the multiple synthetic steps for the ladder - type PCDTBTs have restricted the realization for their usage in BHJ devices . Herein , we present an easily obtainable selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , poly(2,7 - carbazole - alt - diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDSeBT ) by replacing thiophenes with selenophene rings in the polymer backbone . Such a structural modification would be expected the lower - lying LUMO with the HOMO being largely unaffected due to the individual effects of the smaller ionization potential ( IP ) and almost the same electronegativity of selenium relative to sulfur atom . 10 In addition , interchain - charge transfer should be facilitated by intermolecular Se ° ° ° Se contacts , most likely leading to a widen absorption band and enhanced mobility that are desirable for high photocurrents . 11 Our preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic properties of PCDSeBT in typical BHJ devices with [ 6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) shows a highly respectrable PCE of 4.12 % on account of the high J SC and V OC . The synthetic routes to the monomers ( M1 and M2 ) and PCDSeBT are shown in Scheme 1 . Compounds 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were synthesized according to the previously reported procedures . 5a,12 The diboronic ester monomer M1 was easily synthesized from precursor 3 , by dilithiation at -78 ° C , followed by quenching with 2 - iso - propoxy-4,4,5,5 - tetrametyl-1,3,2 - dioxaborolane in anhydrous THF in a yield of 79 % .",

      "text": "The V oc , J sc , fill factor ( FF ) , PCE , and hole mobility of the PSCs are summarized in Table 3 . The blends of PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO with PC71BM at different weight ratios were used to optimize the device performances , and their J - V curves are shown in Figure 5 . The PSCs based on PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than that based on PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM . With a weight ratio of PzNDTDTBO to PC71BM 1.5 : 1 , a PCE of 4.37 % with V oc of 0.76 V , J sc of 10.35 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 55.5 % was achieved while the devices based on PzNDTDTBT showed a relatively low PCE of 2.43 % , with V oc of 0.62 V , J sc of 8.21 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 47.7 % at the optimal PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ratio of 1 : 2 ( w / w ) . The increased value of V oc of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs is in accordance with the decreased value of the HOMO energy level of the polymer and the higher J sc and FF could be attributed to the higher hole mobility ( 4.4 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) . By addition of 1 % 1,8 - diiodooctane ( DIO ) into o - DCB used for spin - coating , the PCEs of the solar cells based on PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO were improved to 3.22 and 4.63 % , respectively , mostly through an increase in the FF . 25 To further improve the photovoltaic performances of the PSC devices , thermal annealing was employed . , the FF of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs increased from 62.5 to 65.5 % , and consequently , the PCE increased from 4.63 to 5.07 % . However , for PzNDTDTBT , the measured PCE was not improved by thermal annealing but , inversely , exhibited a slight decrease of photovoltaic values . Compared with PzNDTDTBT / PzNDTDTBO , PSCs based on PzNDTTPD shows higher V oc , which corresponds to the deepest HOMO energy level of PzNDTTPD ( see Table 2 ) . . . Figure 7 shows the AFM images of the active layer surfaces . Without additive or thermal annealing , both the blend films based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO demonstrate smooth morphology with low average surface roughness ( R a ) of 0.27 and 1.23 nm , respectively . After adding DIO , a nanoscaled fine interpenetrating network and smaller domain size of phase separation are formed , which is beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport . R a is raised from 0.27 to 1.91 nm for PzNDTDTBT and from 1.23 to 1.88 nm for PzNDTDTBO , which can explain the increase of FF of the photovoltaic devices to some degree . When the PzNDTDTBO blend film was then thermally annealed at 150 ° C for 10 min , R a is further increased .",

      "text": "The HOMO / the lowest occupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are -5.45 eV / -3.60 eV and -5.38 eV / -3.45 eV , respectively , as estimated from the oxidation and reduction potentials of cyclic voltammograms ( Fig . 1b and Table 1 ) . The energy levels of the copolymers are lower than those of other heteroarene - based DPP copolymers reported previously , [ 21][22][23][24][25][26 ] and their low - lying HOMO energy levels are expected to afford high V OC s of the polymer solar cells . The crystal properties of the copolymers were investigated by X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) . The two copolymers clearly showed a characteristic diffraction peak in the range of 3 - 5 ° with a weak diffraction peak in the range of 15 - 20 ° which are associated with ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) diffraction , respectively ( Fig . 2a ) , indicating that both copolymers form a crystalline lamellar structure in the thin film state . It should be noted here that these copolymers exhibit distinct X - ray diffraction without any thermal treatment . Both copolymers exhibit a sharp and intense ( 100 ) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.2 ° corresponding to the interchain distance ( d 100 ) of 21.0 Å , while the ( 010 ) diffraction peak was observed at 19.4 ° for PTATDPP and 19.1 ° for PTAFDPP , corresponding to the π - π stacking distance ( d 010 ) of 4.6 Å and 4.7 Å , respectively . For identifying the reason for high crystallinity of the copolymers , the density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation for the minimum energy conformations of the copolymers was performed to reveal the difference of the dihedral angle between the TA and DPP units in the copolymers . To simplify the calculation , one repeating unit of each polymer was used as the model compound , and long alkyl substituents were replaced by the ethyl group . As shown in Fig . 2b , TA and TDPP have a coplanar structure with a dihedral angle smaller than 1 ° while TA and FDPP have a slightly distorted structure with a dihedral angle of 3.8 ° . This difference of the dihedral angle between PTATDPP and PTAFDPP accounts for the difference of d 010 , and thus , PTATDPP is expected to form a more closely - packed lamellar structure than PTAFDPP . To investigate the charge transporting characteristics of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP , bottom - gate and top - contact fieldeffect transistors ( FETs ) were fabricated . Both copolymers clearly exhibit current modulation and saturation with unipolar p - type field - effect charge transporting behavior , as shown in Fig . 3 . The calculated saturation hole mobilities ( μ h ) for PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are 2.7 × 10 ^ -2 and 8.9 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , with high on / off ratios ( > 10 ^ 5 ) and low threshold voltages ( < 20 V ) .",
