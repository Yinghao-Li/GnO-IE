      "text": "Such high energy alignment would not enable to achieve a large open - circuit voltage and is eventually detrimental to the PCE output of PT - based PSCs such as in P3HT / PCBM systems with PCE ranging from 3 to 4 % . 21,22 Geng and co - workers synthesized two PT - based donor materials by incorporating carboxylate side chains and vinylene linkers between thiophene units . The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the resulting polymers , PBT and PTT , were substantially stabilized when compared to those of the parent P3HT . Such energy level lowering was attributed to the integration of carboxylate and vinylene groups giving rise to a push - pull structural motif , resulting in an enhanced PCE of the PV devices based on them . 21 Over the years , the use of the structural effect to enhance PSC performance has been extensively investigated , particularly the donor - acceptor ( D - A ) strategy , which has been proved to be an effective approach to develop donor polymers with wide absorption , low - lying energy levels , and enhanced electron properties . 23 - 32 Besides , conjugation expansion on the polymer backbone is an alternative tool to improve the electronic properties of polymers . By replacing a branched 2ethylhexyl side chain with a linear n - octyl group , Zhang and his co - workers synthesized a PTB7 - Th derivative namely , PBTT . PV cells based on PBTT : IEICO showed a superior device performance than that of the PTB7 - Th - based device with a PCE of 9.5 % , a V oc of 0.86 V , a J sc of 17.9 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 61.3 % . Such dramatic enhancement in efficiency was attributed to a higher charge mobility and improved morphology of the PBTT : IEICO blend film induced by the less steric hindered linear alkyl side chain . 1 Yang and coworkers used selenophene to replace thiophene π - bridge in the indacenodithiophene ( IDT)-benzo[1,2 - c:4,5 - c′]dithiophene-4,8 - dione ( BDD)-based copolymer ( PThBDDIDT ) to develop a donor - π - acceptor type copolymer , PSeBDDIDT . The PCE of solar cells based on polymer : PC71BM as an active layer was dramatically increased from 7.04 to 8.65 % , respectively . Such improvement could result from stronger intermolecular interactions , expanded absorption range , and better molecular planarity of selenophene contained PSeBDDIDT . 33 Random terpolymers comprised of thieno[2′,3′ : 5′,6′]pyrido [ 3,4- g]- thieno[3,2 - c]isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione , thiophene ( T ) , and dithiophene ( 2 T ) were synthesized by Yang and co - workers in which the crystallinity of terpolymers could be controlled by varying the compositions of T and 2T. The PSC based on a terpolymer with the optimized T / 2 T ratio of 7 : 3 showed a high J sc of 18.3 mA cm^-2 and a FF of 71.2 % , thus resulting in an enhanced PCE up to 10.8 % . 34 Fluorination on polymer backbones has also been widely adopted to tune and improve the functional properties of donor polymers such as stabilization of their energy levels and hence positively impacting on PSC performance .",

      "text": "Based on the definition , J ph equals to the difference between the current density of devices under 100 mW cm^-2 ( J L ) and that in the dark ( J D ) . V eff = V 0 - V , where V 0 is the voltage at which J L = J D and V is the applied voltage . When the reverse voltage is greater than 2 V , recombination will be suppressed because of a high internal electric field and thus the current density becomes saturated ( J sat ) . Consequently , P(E , T ) = J ph / J sat could be used to describe the charge dissociation probability . The charge dissociation probability of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based cells was estimated to be 0.86 , 0.94 , 0.98 , and 0.92 , respectively . The highest exciton dissociation of the PffBB-14 - based device is anticipated to give rise to the best photovoltaic performance among these series of polymers . Figure 7 demonstrates the dependence of V oc and J sc against light intensity , which could be used to describe the recombination process in BHJ films . The V oc is directly proportional to the incident light intensity in the semilogarithmic plot with a slope of kT / q , which describes bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film , where k represents the Boltzmann constant , T is the Kelvin temperature , and q is the elementary charge . Trap - assisted recombination exists if the slope is larger than kT / q. 42 Among devices fabricated , the PffBB-14 - based cell exhibited the smallest slope of 1.10 kT / q , suggesting the least trap - assisted recombination . Bimolecular recombination was also investigated by measuring the dependence of J sc against light intensity , in which the exponential factor α in the power law of J sc ∝ P light α is used Article to indicate bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film . The closer the estimated α to 1.0 , the weaker the bimolecular recombination occurs in the device . 43 Obviously , with α = 0.98 , the PffBB-14 - based device would exhibit the least occurrence of bimolecular recombination in the active layer . In contrast , the PffBB-10 - based device showed an α value of 0.86 , indicating that the bimolecular recombination loss was severe in its BHJ film . These results consistently indicate that the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend with superior balanced charge carrier transport exhibits the least recombination loss among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs , thus affording the highest J sc and FF . Morphology of the Active Layer . AFM images of PffBBn : PC71BM blended thin films were obtained to investigate their microphase separation behavior and the corresponding AFM height and phase images recorded in the tapping mode are shown in Figure 8 . Good miscibility could be observed in all of the PffBB - n : PC71BM blended thin films , which gives rise to desirable phase separation .",

Such a D - A strategy is now widely used as one of the most promising approaches to design efficient polymers for application to the polymer photovoltaic . Thiophene is a simple and fundamental block to construct new D - A type copolymers . Recently , the bridged dithiophene has attracted considerable attention as a donor unit because of its ability to fix the dithiophene system into a planar structure , which is much more efficient than the dithiophene in constructing highly - conjugated copolymers . Four bridging dithiophene units with the atoms of carbon ( C ) , silicon ( Si ) , germanium ( Ge ) and nitrogen ( N ) afford cyclopenta[2,1 - b;3,4 - b′]dithiophene ( CPDT ) , dithienosilole ( DTS ) , dithienogermole ( DTG ) and dithieno [ 3,2- b : 2′,3′-d]pyrrole ( DTP ) , respectively . CPDT was first introduced into the low band gap polymers , and the corresponding copolymer alternating CPDT with benzothiadiazole showed a PCE of 5.5 % , after using a small amount of alkanedithiols to control the morphology of the blend film . 14,15 Later on , large amounts of CPDT - based photovoltaic polymers were designed and synthesized . [ 16][17][18][19][20 ] In comparison with the C - C bond , a longer C - Si bond shows less steric hindrance , which directly resulted in better π - π stacking along the conjugated polymer backbones . 21,22 Polymers based on DTS normally have high hole mobility and strong light absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum and hence the improvement in photovoltaic performance , which reached 5.1 % . 12 DTG shows lower intermolecular steric hindrance than DTS because of the longer C - Ge bond compared to the C - Si , resulting in the corresponding DTG - containing solar cells exhibiting higher short - current and fill factor . [ 23][24][25 ] Planar dithieno[3,2 - b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole ( DTP ) , with good π - conjugation , showed great potential for use in organic electronic materials . 26 D - A type photovoltaic polymers with DTP as the electron - donating unit , exhibiting low band gap and enhanced solubility , have been intensively applied to PSCs . 27,28 In our previous study , PSCs based on DTP - containing copolymers and PC 70 BM showed a short - circuit current as high as 22.6 mA cm^-1 , 29 indicating that DTP - containing copolymers could be promising building blocks for superior photovoltaic performance . On the other hand , benzothiadiazole ( BT ) containing the electron - withdrawing imine ( -CvN- ) nitrogen has been widely used as a strong acceptor in D - A copolymers . 30,31 Numerous attempts to develop novel D - A copolymers have shown that 4,7 - dithien-2 - yl-2,1,3 - benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) is an effective acceptor unit , and photovoltaic devices made from blends with fullerene derivatives show PCE up to 5.4 % .",

In this regard , a simple and effective method might be to tune the properties of D - A type photovoltaic polymers by introducing thienyl groups as spacers between donor and acceptor segments in the backbone . In this study , three kinds of low band gap copolymers integrating DTP as the donor block and the most - used BT as the acceptor unit were synthesized . Different numbers of thienyl ( T ) as spacers were introduced along the copolymer main chain to investigate the effect on optical , electrochemical and photovoltaic performance . [ 6,6]-Phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) was used as an acceptor in the blended film of copolymers : PC 70 BM . Different solvents ( chlorobenzene ( CB ) and 1,2 - dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) ) were tested to build an optimized interpenetrated network in the active film , and the corresponding film properties and the photovoltaic device performance are discussed in detail . Fig . 1 shows the optical absorption spectra of PDTP - BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT in CHCl 3 solution and in thin films spin - coated on quartz plates . The absorption maximum wavelength in the solutions and the films and the optical band gap deduced from the absorption onsets are summarized in Table 1 . Judging from the splitting of the absorption bands , it can be speculated that the polymers have the typical absorption characteristics of D - A type copolymers with π - π * and charge transfer - type transitions . Comparing the polymers PDTP - BT and PDTP - DT2BT with the previously synthesized polymer PDTP - DTBT , 27 the difference in their absorption is distinct . The PDTP - DTBT solution showed two prominent absorption maxima at 450 and 671 nm , while PDTP - BT and PDTP - DT2BT solutions demonstrated two main absorption maxima at 413 and 711 nm and at 480 and 603 nm , respectively .

The best devices of PDTP - BT and PDTP - DTBT show PCE of 1.64 % and 2.37 % , respectively . The polymer PDTP - DT2BT exhibits the highest PCE of 3.12 % , ascribed to the largest J SC = 11.43 mA cm^-2 with a slightly lower V OC of 0.54 V and a slightly higher FF of 0.57 than the other polymers . The V OC values of the devices are around 0.5 V , suggesting that the addition of the thienyl units does not affect the main chain distortion . This coincides well with similar HOMO energy levels for the copolymers measured by CV . These results indicate that the PCEs of the photovoltaic devices based on PDTP - DT2BT : PC 70 BM were higher than those of PDTP - DTBT : PC 70 BM and PDTP - BT : PC 70 BM . Overall , it is an effective approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - based copolymers by increasing the number of unsubstituted thienyl units along the copolymers backbone . Fig . 5 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) plots of the devices based on three copolymer : PC 70 BM combinations under the illumination of monochromatic light . With the increase of thienyl spacers , the EQE response wavelengths show a blue shift , a similar tendency to the absorption spectra , but the EQE peak values were higher in PDTP - DT2BT ( 58 % ) compared to PDTP - BT ( 23 % ) or PDTP - DTBT ( 42 % ) . The shapes of the EQE curves of the devices in the range of 450 - 700 nm could be assigned to the stronger absorption of PC 70 BM . In conclusion , three low band gap D - A copolymers , based on the DTP donor and the BT acceptor , with different numbers of thienyl spacers along the backbone have been designed and synthesized . The thienyl spacer makes the absorption spectra peak blue - shift in the longer wavelength range and red - shift in the low wavelength range . Under 1.5 G^100 mW cm^-2 illumination , a best PCE of 3.12 % for PDTP - DT2BT was recorded , with V OC = 0.48 V , J SC = 11.43 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.57 . Although the best PCE is still not high enough for commercial use , our optimization by designing suitable molecular structures , selecting different solvents and changing other factors could provide useful information for further studies of the commercialized PSCs .",

      "text": "By taking into consideration using low bandgap polymers to harvest more solar photons , researchers have devoted much effort recently to reducing the bandgap of polymers . This approach has provided a remarkable short - circuit current density ( J SC ) of 16 mA / cm^2 , 3 whereas , in general , the V OC has suffered 4 because of a higher than the HOMO optimal energy level in order to pursue a lower bandgap . In the PSCs community , poly(2,7 - carbazole - altdithienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDTBT ) is one excellent exam - ple for a low HOMO ( -5.45 eV ) as required by the ' ideal ' πconjugated polymers , which led to a high V OC value over 0.8 V and outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures . 5 The initial PCE reached 3.6 % 6 in a typical BHJ device and has been subsequently improved to exceeding 6 % by BHJ layer thickness optimization and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures . 7 However , the bandgap of PCDTBT is still relatively larger than the proposed 1.5 - 1.7 eV of the ideal polymers for PCEs exceeding 10 % . Recently , to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT without sacrificing its high V OC , Hsu et al . 8 and our group 9 independently reported PCDTBT - based ladder - type polymers with forced planarity of which device performance showed impressive PCEs of up to 4.59 % with reduced bandgap ( ca . 0.2 eV ) in comparison with that of PCDTBT . However , the multiple synthetic steps for the ladder - type PCDTBTs have restricted the realization for their usage in BHJ devices . Herein , we present an easily obtainable selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , poly(2,7 - carbazole - alt - diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDSeBT ) by replacing thiophenes with selenophene rings in the polymer backbone . Such a structural modification would be expected the lower - lying LUMO with the HOMO being largely unaffected due to the individual effects of the smaller ionization potential ( IP ) and almost the same electronegativity of selenium relative to sulfur atom . 10 In addition , interchain - charge transfer should be facilitated by intermolecular Se ° ° ° Se contacts , most likely leading to a widen absorption band and enhanced mobility that are desirable for high photocurrents . 11 Our preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic properties of PCDSeBT in typical BHJ devices with [ 6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) shows a highly respectrable PCE of 4.12 % on account of the high J SC and V OC .

The target poly(2,7 - carbazole - alt - diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDSeBT ) was obtained by Suzuki polymerization of M1 and M2 in degassed toluene / water with K 3 PO 4 as an organic base , Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 as a catalyst , and P(o - tol ) 3 as the corresponding ligand at 90 ° C for 3 days . The crude polymer was purified by reprecipitation and Soxhlet extraction with methanol , acetone , hexane , and chlorobenzene . Details of synthesis of monomers , polymerization , and their characterizations are given in the Experimental Section . After purification , gel - permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis against PS standard exhibits a number - averaged molecular mass ( M n ) of 83 ^ 000 g / mol with a polydispersity ( PDI ) of 2.51 . The polymer is readily soluble in common solvents such as chloroform , toluene , THF , and chlorobenzene . As shown in Figure 1a , the UV - vis absorption spectra of PCDSeBT both in chloroform solution and solid state exhibit two distinct absorption bands , as typically observed for donor ( D)-acceptor ( A ) low bandgap materials . The absorption maxima ( λ max ) of the film are located at 403 and 589 nm . The shorter absorption band is due to π - π * transitions of the polymer backbone , 13 while the lower - energy peak is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) in the electron - rich and electron - deficient units . 14 It is worth noting that the maxima absorption values of PCDSeBT in the film are slightly broadened without any obvious red - shift when compared to the solution . This verifies that only a small reorganization via π - π stacking between the polymer chains is within view during the film formation because of the interchain aggregates in solution . 15 This observation is in contrast to many conjugated polymers , in which there is a red - shift that occurs in going from the solution to the solid state due to the aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state , 3,16 even the PCDTBT film is red - shifted by 30 nm vs solution . 5a Besides , the deep blue color of PCDSeBT solution is observed unlike the red color of PCDTBT in solution ( see the digital photograph in Figure 1a ) . Notably , although the absorption profile of PCDSeBT is similar to that of the thiophene analogue , PCDTBT , the absorption onset of PCDSeBT is significantly red - shifted by ∼ 70 nm , corresponding to a lower optical bandgap ( E g opt = 1.70 eV ) than PCDTBT ( E g opt = 1.85 eV ) .",

The electrochemical properties of PCDSeBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) . As shown in Figure 1b , PCDSeBT exhibits clear reversible n - doping / dedoping processes in the negative potential range , whereas quasi - reversible p - doping / dedoping behaviors in the positive potential range are observed . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be -5.40 eV and -3.70 eV , respectively , using the ferrocene - ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc+ ) redox couple ( 4.8 eV below the vacuum level ) . Both PCDTBT and PCDSeBT have nearly identical HOMO energy levels , but PCDSeBT exhibits 0.10 eV lower - lying LUMO level relative to PCDTBT ( LUMO = -3.60 eV , see also Supporting Information ) , 5a verifying our presumption aforementioned about the effect of selenium on the selective fine - tuning of LUMO level . The material - design rules described by Scharber et al . 19 suggested that the PCEs of a BHJ solar cell should be much more sensitive to changes of the donor LUMO level compared to variations of the donor bandgap . On the basis of the rules , the estimated PCE from the E g opt and the LUMO value of PCDSeBT is 7.8 % . This theoretical value is much higher than that of PCDTBT ( 6.5 % ) , indicating that a highly promising material for PSCs considering the frontier orbital energies . Upon utilizing a model dimeric system containing methyl groups , the optimized molecular geometry of PCDSeBT and its frontier molecular orbitals of the calculated HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces were computed by density functional theory ( DFT , B3LYP / 6 - 31 G ) ( Figure 1d ) .

Interestingly , in contrast , as the PCDSeBT thin films are annealed at a temperature of 120 and 150 ° C , the mobilities are systematically improved up to 1.0 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 / V ° s ( Figure 2b ) , which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of PCDTBT , possibly due to increased interpolymer chain contact induced by Se ° ° ° Se interactions with the thermal annealing process . To gain a better understanding of the influence of the thermal annealing , the crystallinity and molecular organization of PCDTBT and PCDSeBT thin films were investigated by Xray diffraction ( XRD ) , both before and after annealing at 150 ° C . Both the as - cast and annealed PCDTBT thin films fail to reveal any defined scattering patterns ( Figure 3a ) , indicating the macroscopically disordered , amorphous structure . In the case of PCDSeBT , the as - cast thin films show very weak diffractions ( Figure 3b ) . Upon thermal annealing , the primary peak at 4.42 ° , corresponding to a d - spacing of 19.99 Å , progressively intensifies and the secondary broad peak at ∼ 21.1 ° ( d = 4.21 Å ) that is probably related to π - π stacking becomes visible ( Figure 3b ) . On the basis of these XRD results , we can conclude that the oriented microstructure of the as - cast PCDSeBT thin films is kinetically limited but the polymer chains reorganize to ordered lamellar packing structures upon annealing . This observation is a plausible explanation for the sudden rise in mobility of PCDSeBT as a function of the thermal annealing .",

The lower bandgap with the broaden absorption band significantly improves a J SC of 11.7 mA / cm^2 , which is among the highest J SC values for PSCs based on PCDTBT derivatives , while the low HOMO energy level maintains the high V OC value . The corresponding PCE is 4.12 % , about 37 % higher than that obtained from a PCDTBT - based reference device . This work provides a feasible strategy for selective fine - tuning of LUMO levels , which achieves a high J SC value , while nearly remaining a high V OC .

PFDTBT showed a maximum PCE of 2.2 % , and PFDTBT derivatives containing branched alkyl chains ( BisDMO - PFDTBT ) showed higher PCEs . 10,11 Some molecules and polymers that have flat structures such as fluorene , 12 - 16 anthracene , 17 and pyrene 18,19 have been reported to form excimers or aggregates by strong interchain π - π interactions . Excimer formation could affect the emission properties of molecules or polymers , therefore , the excimer or exciplex formation has been used as a fluorescence probe for molecular recognition . 19 In organic photovoltaic devices , π - π interactions between low - band gap donor polymers are important for charge transportation . Enhanced π - π interactions in p - type donor polymers could improve their chargetransport ability , and thus increase short - circuit currents in solar cells . In this study we report on a new approach to improve PCE of OPVs by enhancing the interchain π - π interaction . To do this we introduced flat perylene units into the conjugated polymers . We synthesized poly[2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2 - thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole ) ] ( PFDTBT ) , poly[2,2′-(9,9 - dioctylfluorene-2,7 - diyl)dithiophene - alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2 - thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole ) ] ( PFD2TBT ) , and their ter - polymers with perylene units . Optical , electrical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated . Synthetic routes and polymer structures are shown in Schemes 1 and 2 . The UV - visible absorption spectra of the synthesized polymers were recorded in both chloroform solution and as a solid thin film . PFDTBT and the ter - polymer solutions exhibited two distinct absorption bands , where the first absorption peak is at around 387 nm , corresponding to the π - π * transition of the conjugated polymer backbone , 23,24 and the second absorption band in the longer wavelength region at around 530 nm , can be attributed to the strong internal charge - transfer ( ICT ) interaction between donating and accepting groups in the main chain . 21 Peak and edge positions were almost equivalent for PFDTBT , PFDTBT_5Per and PFDTBT_10Per , but the maximum absorption peak for PFDTBT_20Per moved to a shorter wavelength region . This might be due to a decrease in the internal charge - transfer ( ICT ) interaction cause by a decreased content of electron - withdrawing DTBT monomer in the copolymer . PFD2TBT and the ter - polymer solutions also exhibited two absorption bands at around 410 and 520 nm . The absorption maxima and edges of the polymer solutions showed little dependence upon perylene contents .

The fieldeffect mobility for PFDTBT , PFDTBT-5Per , PFDTBT-10Per , and PFDTBT-20Per was determined to be 1.0 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.2 × 10 ^ -4 , 5.3 × 10 ^ -4 , and 1.2 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively .

Figure 7 shows the current - voltage ( J - V ) characteristics of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices . It can be observed that the open circuit voltages of cells fabricated using PFDTBT and its ter - polymers range from 0.70 to 0.77 V. The device fabricated using PFDTBT showed higher open circuit voltages than those of perylene - containing copolymers . This coincides with the relative HOMO energy levels of the polymers . As the perylene content in the copolymers increased , the amount of DTBT contents decreased , and so the HOMO of the polymers moved to higher energy levels . PFDTBT has the deepest HOMO energy level , thus it showed the highest open circuit voltage ( 0.77 V ) .",

Even though PFDTBT_20Per showed the highest hole mobility among the PFDTBT - based copolymers , it is UV - visible absorption spectrum showed greater blue - shifting than PFDTBT , as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , and it showed the widest band gap energy among all of the polymers considered herein . This may be why the short circuit current of the device fabricated using PFDTBT_20Per is lower than that of PFDTBT , despite it higher mobility . The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the best photovoltaic performance among the PFDTBT - based polymers ( V oc = 0.74 V , J sc = 7.19 mA / cm^2 , PCE = 2.16 % ) . For the photovoltaic devices fabricated using PFD2TBT - based polymers , the shortcircuit currents of the devices also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased ; however , the PCEs of the devices using PFD2TBT - based polymers were lower than those of PFDTBT - based polymers because of lower open - circuit voltages and short - circuit currents .

The increase in the short circuit current originates from the introduction of the thin titanium suboxide ( TiO x ) layer ( ca . ∼ 10 nm ) . The titanium suboxide layer could block holes to the aluminum electrode , thus it could increase the short circuit current of the photovoltaic device . The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the highest PCE of 3.16 % with an open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , a short circuit current of 9.61 mA / cm^2 and the highest fill factor ( 0.41 ) among the fabricated devices .

Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) showed that PSFDTBT is of good thermal stability with less than 5 % weight loss up to 340 ° C. No clear glass transition was observed from 25 to 300 ° C in its DSC curves of the second heating and cooling runs ( 20 ° C / min ) . Optical and Electrochemical Properties . UV - vis absorption spectra of PSFDTBT in THF solution and in film are shown in Figure 1 . In THF solution , PSFDTBT exhibited a broad absorption in the range of ultraviolet to visible region with two peaks located at 395 and 527 nm , respectively . In film , the absorption of PSFDTBT became broader and slightly redshifted with two peaks located at 401 and 562 nm , respectively . In comparison with the absorption spectrum in solution , the absorption spectrum in film became broader and red - shifted for about 35 nm , indicating the aggregation or ordered packing of polymer chains in solid state . Ordered packing of polymer chains is beneficial for improving the charge mobility of resulting films . 14 The optical absorption onset of PSFDTBT film is at 629 nm , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.97 eV. PC71BM was chosen as the acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PC61BM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region with a broad peak from 440 to 530 nm , which compensates the absorption valley of the polymer . 15 As shown in Figure 1 , the PSFDTBT / PC71BM blending film ( 1 : 3 by weight ) has a strong absorption over a broad wavelength range of 400 ^ -700 nm . The electrochemical properties of PSFDTBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) . The HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT was determined to be -5.40 eV according to the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ) , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential in volts vs Ag / Ag + . 16 Since the open circuit voltage V oc of BHJ PSCs is correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , 5,17 therefore a higher V oc for PSFDTBT based polymer solar cells is anticipated due to the low - lying HOMO energy level .",

In Figure 6a , microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM , while the polymer formed a small fibril - type domain at a 1 : 1 PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio . As shown in Figure 6c , the fibril domain or microphase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size . It appears that this type of fibril domain occurred because PQCDTB formed effective π - π stacking based on outstanding crystallinity . 31 As shown in Figure 6b , in contrast , when the PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio was 1 : 2 , the polymers were assembled , and a large domain was formed . As a result , a relatively large - size phase separation took place . As shown in Figure 6d , the large domain or the large - size phase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size . The large - phase separation exhibits a low photocurrent by reducing the charge separation and increasing the exciton diffusion length and the recombination of electric charges . 32 Therefore , at a 1 : 2 polymer / PC71BM ratio , a large phase separation occurs between the polymer and the PC71BM . As a result , a low photocurrent would occur ; this is comparable to the 1 : 1 ratio . The same results were confirmed for the current device using the data in Table 3 . Similar results were observed between PQCDTB and PC61BM as well . When the PCZDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 4 , a smooth morphology was detected , and no fibril domain was observed , just like the PQCDTB , because the self - organization of PCZDTB is lower than that of PQCDTB . 9 In this study , PQCDTB has been successfully synthesized through the Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing planar quinacridone unit and a broad - absorption benzothiadiazole unit . PQCDTB had a high molecular weight and good thermal stability . Because of the appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels , an effective balance was produced . According to the X - ray diffraction measurement , a broad diffraction peak was observed at approximately 24.0 ° .

It could promote intrachain and interchain interactions along and between coplanar polymer chains . Zhang et al . pioneered to use thiophene imide as a building block in conjugated polymers . 15,16 Later , thiophene imide homopolymers were synthesized . 17 - 19 Recently , polymer solar cells based on blends of copolymers of thiophene imide and benzodithiophene 20 - 23 or cyclopentadithiophene 24 with soluble fullerene derivatives PC71BM or PC61BM exhibited PCEs of 3 - 6.8 % . Wudl et al . reported low - bandgap conjugated polymers based on thiophene - fused phthalimide , i.e. , isothianaphthene imides ( 5 , Figure 1 ) . 25,26 2,2 0 -Bithiophene-3,3 0 -dicarboximide ( BTI , 6 , Figure 1 ) with π - core planarity , antiparallel BTI packing , a short cofacial π - π distance of 3.43 Å , and a favorable solubilizing group orientation is a promising building block in n - type polymers . 27 Facchetti et al . reported that n - channel OFET based on a bithiophene imide homopolymer exhibited a μ e of 1.1 x 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , I on / I off of 2 x 10 ^ 7 , and a high V th ( 75 V ) in vacuum after annealing process at 240 ° C. 27 The fused - ring system can maximize the π - orbital overlap by restricting intramolecular rotation in the oligomer and possibly to induce face - to - face π - stacking , facilitating charge transport through intermolecular hopping . On the other hand , the fused rings can make the polymer backbone more rigid and coplanar , therefore enhancing effective π - conjugation , lowering bandgap , and extending absorption . 28 - 31 Therefore , fused - ring building blocks are widely used in synthesis of conjugated polymers . 32 - 34 For example , the large planar benzodithiophene ( BDT ) unit has emerged as an attractive building block for conjugated polymers . 35 Benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene ( 7 , Figure 2 ) with a curved structure prevents a fully conjugated pathway between substituents at the 2 - and 6 - positions . Hence , delocalization of the conjugated π - electron system along the copolymer backbone is disfavored by the incorporation of this unit . This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation . Additionally , compared to a single thiophene ring , it must be pointed out that due to the large resonance stabilization energy of BDT , the delocalization of electrons from the BDT unit into the backbone is less favorable than from the thiophene ring . As a result , a more stable copolymer with high performance can be obtained by using BDT as the core unit . OFETs based on a benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene copolymer manufactured on flexible substrate exhibited high hole mobility of 0.5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 when the source - gate voltage is increased to 60 V.",

The combination of benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene planarity and efficient π - π stacking with the electron - withdrawing capacity of the imide functionality serves as the foundation for this new class of materials . Introduction of the π - electron - deficient imide moiety can decrease the HOMO and LUMO energies of the polymers , which is necessary for air - stable polymers . Furthermore , substitution at the imide nitrogen allows introduction of functionalities and solubility improvement with varying degrees of steric bulk while not impinging on critical intermolecular π - π stacking characteristics . This motif also leaves the benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene 2 - and 7 - positions available for polymerization . Finally , the dipole moment caused by the imide could stabilize cofacial antiparallel intra - and interchain repeat unit orientations , planarize the backbone , and promote π - π stacking . 27 On the basis of this new building block , we designed and synthesized a series of conjugated copolymers : unit 8 coupled with electron - rich unit benzo[1,2b:4,5 - b 0 ] dithiophene ( P1 and P2 ) or with electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole ( P3 and P4 ) or benzo [ c ] [ 1,2,5]thiadiazole ( P5 ) and homopolymer ( P6 ) ( Figure 2 ) . The optical properties and electronic structure ( HOMO / LUMO levels and bandgap ) can be manipulated through adjusting copolymerized building blocks . ' RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization . The synthetic routes to the monomers and polymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2 . We chose very cheap , industrial product maleic anhydride as a starting material . Bromination of maleic anhydride with Br 2 gave its dibromide ( 1 ) . 41 Then , amination with alkylamine afforded the alkyl - substituted 3,4dibromopyrrole-2,5 - dione ( 2a , b ) . Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide 2a , b with 3 - thienylboronic acid gave 3,4 - bis(3 - thienyl)pyrrole-2,5 - dione ( 3a , b ) . The large sulfur - containing polycyclic aromatic imides , dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 4a , b ) , were synthesized through iron(III ) chloride - mediated oxidative cyclization , which is a general strategy for ring closure . 42 Bromination of 4a , b with Br 2 gave rise to the monomers 5a , b. Stille coupling reaction of 5a with tributyl(thiophen-2 - yl)stannane afforded 2,7 - bis(2 - thienyl)-dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 6a ) , which was brominated with NBS to afford monomer 7a . Copolymers P1 - P4 were synthesized through Stille coupling reaction of the dibromide monomers 5a , b or 7a with benzodithiophene-2,6 - ditin or 2,2 0 -bithiazole-5,5 0 -ditin , while P5 was synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide monomer 5b with benzothiadiazole-4,7 - diboronic ester . Homopolymer P6 was synthesized by palladium - catalyzed homocoupling of the dibromide 5b in the presence of hexabutylditin . P1 with three solubilizing n - dodecyl groups has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , THF , and toluene .",

The optical properties of these random terpolymers can be easily controlled by tuning the ratio between DPP and TPD ; an increase in TPD induced increased absorption between 400 and 650 nm and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level , while higher DPP contents resulted in stronger absorption between 600 and 900 nm . The best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.33 % was obtained from PBDTT - DPP75 - TPD25 with [ 6,6]-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) due to the improved light absorption and thus a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) higher than 16 mA / cm^2 . Interestingly , the trend observed in the PCE values differed from that of optical behavior of the PBDTT - DPP - TPD in terms of the DPP to TPD ratio , showing nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % . Density functional theory calculations showed that the small portions of strong electron - withdrawing DPP in PBDTT - DPP25 - TPD75 and PBDTT - DPP10 - TPD90 could provide trap sites , which suppress efficient charge transfer . In contrast , for PBDTT - DPP90 - TPD10 and PBDTT - DPP75 - TPD25 , the effect of minor portions of TPD on electron density distribution was found to be minimal . In addition , the polymer packing and nanomorphology were investigated by grazing - incidence X - ray scattering and atomic force microscopy . The findings suggested that controlling the ratio of electron - deficient units in the random terpolymers is critical for optimizing their performance in polymer solar cells because it affects the polymer packing structure , the optical and electrical properties , and the electron distribution in the polymers . Low - band - gap polymers for bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ)-type polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have been studied intensively with the aim of matching a greater part of the solar spectrum and thus harvesting more photon flux , to produce efficiencies greater than 7 - 9 % . 1 - 9 In most cases , low - band - gap polymers achieved by the donor - acceptor ( D - A ) approach do not show broad absorption , but instead the absorption maxima are redshifted , decreasing the number of absorbed photons in the visible region and ultimately limiting the achievable photocurrent . 10 - 13 One promising approach toward broadening the absorption of the solar spectrum is to develop random terpolymers based on the copolymerization of two different electron - rich units and one electron - deficient unit 14 - 16 or one electron - rich unit and two different electron - deficient units . 17 - 22 The judicious selection of two different electrondeficient or - rich groups with different electron - withdrawing or - donating strengths is critical to achieve complementary and broad visible light absorption , thus maximizing photon harvesting . However , successful examples of random terpolymers with broad light absorption and high efficiency are limited .",

The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / LiF / Al , where the polymers ( P1- P7 ) were used as electron donors and PC71BM ( or PC61BM ) was used as an electron acceptor . To optimize the morphology and ordering structure , different volume percentages of 1,8diiodooctane were added . 43 Figure 4 shows the current density versus voltage ( J - V ) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW / cm^2 .

From P1 to P4 , PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor , but for P5 , P6 , and P7 , PC61BM was used as the electron acceptor . P5 , P6 , and P7 blended with PC61BM showed higher PCE values than when they were blended with PC71BM in spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , which is most likely due to the lower miscibility of those polymers with PC71BM . 44 The V OC of these random terpolymers increased in the order P2 ( 0.74 V ) ∼ P3 ( 0.74 V ) < P4 ( 0.76 V ) < P5 ( 0.79 V ) < P6 ( 0.82 V ) . The trend in the V OC of the PSCs can be explained by the HOMO energy level of the polymers because the V OC is typically linearly proportional to the difference in energy between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor . 45 However , the PCE of the random terpolymers showed a the nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % in the order P3 ( 5.61 % ) > P4 ( 5.26 % ) > P2 ( 4.91 % ) > P5 ( 3.02 % ) > P6 ( 2.09 % ) ; this was consistent with the observed trend of the J SC .

In contrast , the PCE suddenly decreased in the blended device of P5 and PC61BM ( 3.02 % ) and further decreased in P6 ( 2.09 % ) , mainly due to the significant decrease of the J SC . The low J SC values of P5 and P6 were unexpected , considering the lower band gaps of P5 ( 1.49 eV ) and P6 ( 1.55 eV ) compared to that of P7 ( 1.85 eV ) . To better understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC values , the space - chargelimited current ( SCLC ) of hole - only devices of the P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 blended devices were measured and compared ( Figure S5 ) . The hole - only devices were constructed under optimized device conditions with the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / blends / Au . The hole mobilities of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 were 1.14 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.13 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.09 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.10 × 10 ^ -4 , and 1.18 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively , showing that the hole mobilities of all random terpolymers were similar to or 1 order of magnitude higher than their parent polymers . Therefore , the trend of the J SC can not be explained solely by the changes in the optical properties and the hole mobilities . To gain a better understanding of the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC and PCE values of the PBDTT- DPP - TPD random terpolymers , the molecular geometries and the electron density distribution were simulated using density functional theory ( DFT ) at the B3LYP / 6 - 31G(d , p ) level with the Spartan 08 software package . Three repeating units were taken as a model for calculations , and methyl was used instead of the long side chains to reduce the computational time . Four model compounds , ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 , ( BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP ) , ( BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD ) , and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 were used and calculated for comparison . The optimized molecular geometries of the models and their calculated HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals are depicted in Figure 5 and Figure S7 . In general , for alternative copolymers , the electron density in the HOMO wave functions is well delocalized . However , the LUMO wave function shows a different degree of localization in the electron density dependent on the types of the electron - withdrawing units . 46,47 This tendency was observed in ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 .",

In contrast , for ( BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD ) , the electron density distribution in the HOMO wave function is different from those of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 5c , d ) . Therefore , the small portions of DPP could hinder the preseparation of an exciton into a loosely Coulombically bound exciton , which suppresses electron transfer from donor ( polymer ) to acceptor ( PCBM ) . 48 - 50 Therefore , one possible explanation of the lower PCEs in P5 and P6 is that the DPP acts as a trapping site , resulting in poor intramolecular charge transfer . In contrast , as evidenced in the results of the DFT calculations for ( BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP ) , the electron distribution in the HOMO and LUMO wave functions is similar to those of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 ( Figures 5a , b ) . Such a trapping effect is expected to be trivial in P2 and P3 random terpolymers with a higher DPP to TPD ratio . Therefore , the incorporation of different electron - deficient units could significantly influence the intramolecular charge transfer , suggesting that the optimum composition is required to tune the intra - and intermolecular charge transfer and their performance of PSCs . More detailed studies are currently underway . Finally , to further improve the PCE of P3 : PC71BM , methanol was spin - coated on the top of the active layer before electrode deposition .

As more TPD was introduced into the polymer backbone , the domain spacing of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 gradually increased from 19.2 , 20.1 , 21.9 , 22.7 to 24.1 Å , respectively . This is likely due to the increased amount of structurally longer alkyl side chains of TPD . Figure S8 shows that the pristine polymers exhibited a distinctive arc scattering of the ( 010 ) peak along the out - of - plane direction at q = 1.62- 1.68 Å -1 , corresponding to π - π stacking . The π - π stacking is more prominent in the out - of - plane direction , which suggests that most of the polymer backbones are oriented parallel to the substrates . The π - π stacking distances of polymers were 3.85 , 3.86 , 3.84 , 3.85 , and 3.74 Å for P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 , respectively . The combination effects of the DPP to TPD ratio with changes in the alkyl chain could affect the π - π stacking distance of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 and backbone planarity , thus influencing their charge transport properties . The π - π stacking feature of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 in the blended films was significantly changed by the addition of PCBM , as shown in Figure 6 . No π - π stacking diffraction was observed in P1 , P3 , and P4 , and only a faint π - π stacking diffraction pattern in the out - of - plane direction appeared for P5 . However , P7 had a prominent π - π stacking peak even after the addition of PCBM , indicating that the polymer backbone adopts a preferential \" face - on \" orientation relative to the substrate . In spite of the \" face - on \" orientation of P7 , its mobility was observed to be slightly lower compared to the other polymers , which is most likely due to the presence of fewer percolating pathways for hole transport . 54 Therefore , the GIXS patterns revealed that the incorporation of the different units of DPP and TPD affects the polymeric ordering ( i.e. , domain spacing ) as well as its direction . For further characterization , the BHJ morphology of the polymer blends was investigated by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . The resulting AFM and TEM images are shown in Figure 7 and Figure S9 , respectively . The images of P1 , P3 , P4 , and P5 blends showed bicontinuous structures of polymer and PCBM as well as small - scale phase separation favorable for exciton dissociation .",

Also , integration of thiophene with acene rings into a rigid and coplanar entity facilitates π - electron delocalization and induces strong π - π stacking for efficient charge transport .

It was also reported that angular - fused NDT has a lower - lying HOMO energy level than that of linearfused NDT , which could be beneficial for better air stability and greater open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) for polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) . 9c Very recently , our group reported a broad bandgap D - A copolymer PzNDTTPD based on 4,9 - bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)-naphtho [ 1,2 - b:5,6 - b′]dithiophene and thieno [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-4,6dione ( TPD ) . 14 The polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) with PzNDTTPD as donor and [ 6,6]-phenyl - C71 - butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor demonstrated a PCE of 5.26 % with a high V oc of 0.91 V compared to the linear NDT - TPD - based copolymer PNDTTPD with a PCE of 4.0 % and a V oc of 0.69 V. 15 Meanwhile , high - performance p - channel fieldeffect transistors with hole mobility of 0.067 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and an on / off current ratio of 10 ^ 9 -10 ^ 10 were obtained .

In films , the absorption spectra of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are similar to those in solution , with obvious red - shifts ( 56 - 68 nm ) of their absorption maxima as shown in Figure 3b , which is a common phenomenon for conjugated polymers , owing to the aggregation of the conjugated polymer main chains in the solid films . In addition , both PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO display prominent vibronic shoulders at shorter wavelengths , implying an ordered arrangement in their solid films , with strong π - π stacking between the polymeric backbonesa feature that also appears in the spectra of regioregular poly(3 - hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT ) , which is beneficial to improve the charge mobility of resulting films . 21 The absorption edges for solid films of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are 703 and 704 nm , respectively , corresponding to nearly the same optical band gap ( E g opt ) of 1.76 eV. Compared with the reported copolymer PzNDTTPD , 14 both PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO show broader absorption spectra and smaller bandgaps , which can be attributed to the stronger electron - accepting ability of the BT / BO unit in the copolymer , and this is beneficial to increase the light - harvesting capacity for higher short - circuit current density ( J sc ) . 2d Electrochemical Properties . Cyclic voltammetry has been employed and considered as an effective tool in investigating electrochemical properties of conjugated organic molecules and polymers . 22 From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammogram , energy levels of HOMO and LUMO can be readily estimated , which correspond to ionization potential ( IP ) and electron affinity ( EA ) , respectively . Cyclic voltammogram of the polymer films are shown in Figure 4 . The onset oxidation potential ( E ox ) / onset reduction potential ( E red ) of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are 0.75 / -0.97 and 0.90 / -1.02 V vs Ag / AgCl , respectively . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer were The HOMO , LUMO , and electrochemical bandgaps ( E g ec ) of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO , calculated from the value of E ox and E red of the polymers , are -5.15 / -3.43 / 1.71 and -5.30 / -3.38 / 1.92 eV , respectively ( see Table 2 ) . For the convenience of comparison , the optical and electrochemical parameters of the PzNDTTPD are also given in Table 2 .

The PSCs based on PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than that based on PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM . With a weight ratio of PzNDTDTBO to PC71BM 1.5 : 1 , a PCE of 4.37 % with V oc of 0.76 V , J sc of 10.35 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 55.5 % was achieved while the devices based on PzNDTDTBT showed a relatively low PCE of 2.43 % , with V oc of 0.62 V , J sc of 8.21 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 47.7 % at the optimal PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ratio of 1 : 2 ( w / w ) . The increased value of V oc of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs is in accordance with the decreased value of the HOMO energy level of the polymer and the higher J sc and FF could be attributed to the higher hole mobility ( 4.4 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) .

R a is raised from 0.27 to 1.91 nm for PzNDTDTBT and from 1.23 to 1.88 nm for PzNDTDTBO , which can explain the increase of FF of the photovoltaic devices to some degree .

Herein , the EQE curves of the devices with the optimal performance are shown in Figure 8 . The devices showed a relatively high photoconversion efficiency over the whole wavelength range of 300 - 700 nm , with monochromatic EQE values around 50 - 60 % . Compared to the absorption spectra of pristine polymers , the significantly broadened EQE responses in the visible region can be attributed to both the intrinsic absorptions of the polymers and PC71BM . Also , it can be noted that devices based on PzNDTDTBO show stronger Field - Effect Transistor Properties . The performances of polymer field - effect transistors based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO were investigated using a bottom - gate , bottomcontact configuration . . ( Figure 9 ) . All devices with L = 5 μm showed the highest hole mobility at different annealing temperatures . The devices showed a typical p - type transporting characteristic measured under ambient conditions . As shown in Table 4 , for both polymers the annealing temperature tends to affect the hole mobility . All devices based on both polymers were annealed at 60 , 100 , 140 , 180 , 220 , and 260 ° C , and both polymers showed thermal stability on each device . Figure 10 shows the output curves and transfer characteristics of the OFETs based on the polymers at 25 ° C and optimal annealing temperature . ( Other OFETs data at different annealing temperatures are shown in Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2 . ) After thermal annealing , the hole mobilities of both copolymers are increased , which implies that the crystallinity of the polymer films and ordered lamellar structure of π - π closepacking for polymer main chain are significantly improved at higher temperatures . High current modulation is observed with on / off current ratio of 10 ^ 6 -10 ^ 7 for PzNDTBTBO while PzNDTDTBT shows relatively lower on / off ratio of 10 ^ 3 -10 ^ 4 . The resulting optimal P - channel transistors demonstrate high hole mobilities of 0.43 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and 0.34 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTBTBO . Both the hole mobilities are among the highest values for BT - or BO - based polymers . In order to deeply study the variation of the performances of OFETs of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO after annealing , the thin - film microstructures and topographies were investigated by X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) and AFM . Figure 11 shows XRD patterns of the polymer thin films deposited on OTSmodified Si / SiO 2 substrates . For both polymers , obvious diffraction peaks were detected before the samples were annealed , which indicates that some degree of crystallinity has been formed at room temperature .

Therefore , the spacers consist of thiophene or bithiophene functionalized with various alkyl side chains were introduced in between IDT and NT units to improve the solubility of the resulting polymers , which may also potentially lead to improved molecular weight that is favorable for the optimal morphology and charge carrier transport . 39 - 41 We notice that the incorporated side chains may also increase the dihedral angle of their contiguous aromatic units , 42,43 which may somewhat inhibit polymer backbone planarity and thereby increase band gap and lower the charge carrier mobility . 40,41 However , it should be tried several different alkyl side chains to achieve a delicate balance of the molecular weight , solubility as well as planarity of polymers as no comprehensive rule has yet emerged of the influences of specific side chains . 44,45 It was realized that by switching the spacer between the IDT and NT units , the processability , backbone planarity , charge carrier mobility and film morphology can be optimized . Further investigation of photovoltaic performances indicates all devices present high V oc because of the relatively deep HOMO energy levels of these polymers , and the highest PCE of 5.05 % was achieved based on PIDT - C12NT .

Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have important advantages over inorganic - based solar cells such as low material - cost , ease of fabrication with low processing - cost and the potential for fabrication of large area and flexible solar cells . 1 In the last decade , remarkable progress in the performance of PSCs has been achieved by introducing a bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure in the active layer .

To simplify the calculation , one repeating unit of each polymer was used as the model compound , and long alkyl substituents were replaced by the ethyl group . As shown in Fig . 2b , TA and TDPP have a coplanar structure with a dihedral angle smaller than 1 ° while TA and FDPP have a slightly distorted structure with a dihedral angle of 3.8 ° .

      "text": "The decent hole mobilities of both copolymers can be attributed to high crystallinity of the copolymers due to the highly coplanar structure of anthracene and DPP . It is also understood that the 3 - fold higher chargecarrier mobility of PTATDPP than that of PTAFDPP arises from its stronger π - π stacking with a shorter d 010 , as discussed above . When the photovoltaic properties of copolymers are measured using PC71BM as an electron acceptor , it is found that the optimum blend ratio of polymer : PC71BM is 1 : 2 to afford the best PCE of both copolymers with the conventional device architecture of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al ( Fig . S2 and Table S1 † ) . The best PCE was also achieved when o - dichlorobenzene was used as a solvent and the optimum thickness for the active layer was ca . 90 nm . The current density - voltage ( J - V ) characteristics of the optimized solar cells are shown in Fig . 4 , and the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Tables 2 and S2 . † PTATDPP showed a best PCE of 6.69 % ( V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 12.3 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.68 ) , while PTAFDPP showed a best PCE of 5.02 % ( V OC = 0.76 V , J SC = 11.2 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.59 ) . Both copolymers showed higher V OC s than other DPP - based copolymers due to their low - lying HOMO energy levels . Both copolymers also exhibited high J SC s and FFs , indicating their decent ability for charge generation and transport . Therefore , the TA unit is a promising electron - donating unit for low band - gap copolymers with a low - lying HOMO energy level . When the PSC devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture ( ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag ) in order to further improve the photovoltaic performance , the PCEs of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP - based devices were improved to 7.02 % and 5.22 % , respectively ( Fig . 4b , Tables 2 and S2 † ) , mainly due to enhanced J SC s ( V OC s and FFs were not changed significantly ) . It is noteworthy here that the PCE of over 7 % of PTATDPP is the highest efficiency of anthracene - based low band - gap conjugated copolymers . In spite of the same band - gap of the two copolymers , PTATDPP shows slightly higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP ( Fig . S3 † ) . This can be ascribed to the closely packed microstructures of PTATDPP and thereby its high charge - carrier mobility than PTAFDPP . When the crystal structures of blend films of the copolymers with PC71BM were examined by XRD , the PTATDPP / PC71BM blend had strong and intense ( 100 ) diffraction while the PTAFDPP / PC71BM blend showed weak and broad ( 100 ) diffraction ( Fig . 2b ) .",

      "text": "This result leads us to conclude that PTATDPP retains a higher crystalline nature in the blend with PC71BM , affording a better hole transporting pathway and thus exhibiting a higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP . When the morphologies of active layers were observed by transmission electron microscopy , the PTATDPP : PC71BM blend shows clearly a fibril nanostructure ( fibril width ∼ 30 nm ) with the formation of a bi - continuous network , whereas the PTAFDPP : PC71BM blend shows a phase - separated morphology without the formation of distinct nanostructures , as shown in Fig . 5 . It is well recognized that the nanoscale phase separation with a fibril structure is favourable for an efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport which are the prerequisites for high J SC and FF of PSCs . Therefore , the high FF ( 0.68 ) of PTATDPP - based device arises mainly from the efficient charge - carrier mobility and the formation of a nanoscale fibril structure of PTATDPP . To further evaluate the potential of PTATDPP as an electron donor material for PSCs , we fabricated a non - fullerene PSC device by blending PTATDPP with a non - fullerene small molecular electron acceptor , 2,2′9,9′-tetra(undecan-6 - yl)- [ 5,5′bianthra ( 2,1,9 - def:6,5,10 - d′e′f′)diisoquinolin]-1,1′,3,3′,8,8′,10,10′- ( 2H,2′H,9H,9′H)-octaone ( di - PBI ) . 38 As can be seen in Fig . 6a , PTATDPP and di - PBI have well - matched energy levels with a LUMO - LUMO offset of 0.4 eV , 39 which is enough for exciton dissociation , and also exhibit complementary absorption , i.e. , di - PDI and PTATDPP absorb 400 - 600 nm and 600 - 800 nm , respectively . As a consequence , the blend film ( 1 : 2 in weight ratio ) exhibits a broad light absorption from 400 to 800 nm . The compatibility of PTATDPP and di - PBI as an electron donor and an acceptor , respectively , was also examined by monitoring the photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching of each compound in the blend film . As shown in Fig . 6c , the blend film shows excellent PL quenching over 95 % of each PL from PTATDPP and di - PBI , indicating that photogenerated excitons from both PTATDPP and di - PBI are readily dissociated into free carriers at the interface of two materials . The non - fullerene PSC fabricated from the blend of PTATDPP and di - PBI exhibits a PCE of 4.23 % with V OC = 0.77 V , J SC = 9.8 mA cm^-2 and FF = 0.56 ( Fig . 7 ) . Interestingly , the blend morphology of PTATDPP and di - PDI as observed from atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and TEM reveals that PTATDPP forms a well - developed interconnected BHJ morphology with a fibrillar nanostructure ( Fig . S4 and S5 † ) . This fibril morphology affords the effective exciton dissociation as observed from the PL quenching experiment .",

We have designed and synthesized two anthracene - based low band - gap copolymers , PTATDPP and PTAFDPP .

In order to develop high - performance side - chain D - A conjugated polymers , it is necessary to develop new catalog of side - chain D - A polymers for efficient PSCs . Given that benzo [ 1,2 - b:4,5 - b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) unit has a large planar molecular structure by fusing a benzene with two flanking thiophenyl units and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) , i.e. , pyrrolo[3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione unit has a well conjugated structure with strong π - π interaction and electron - withdrawing effect , some main - chain D - A copolymers based on DPP or / and BDT units as prime building block had been designed for optoelectronic applications in both thin - film transistors and solar cells in recent years . 6 It is worthy to note that PSCs based on these copolymers with a tandem structure showed an increasing PCE of 8.62 % . 2a Here we report another novel sidechain D - A conjugated copolymer ( PBDT - TDPP - S ) for highperformance PSCs , in which the BDT and thiophene units are conjugatedly formed the main chain and the di(thiophen-2yl)pyrrolo [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione ( TDPP ) units are pended onto the thiophenyl units to build the side chain by a linkage of a 2 - vinylthiophenyl unit . Using PBDT - TDPP - S as electron donor and PC71BM as electron acceptor , the resulting PSCs exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a PCE of 4.89 % , an open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.84 V , a shortcircuit current ( J SC ) of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 56.0 % . To our best knowledge , the efficiency is among the highest reported to date for side - chain D - A conjugated copolymers and is twice higher than that of the main - chain D - A counterpart polymer PBDTDPP - OR in the single BHJ PSCs . synthesized by a common Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as catalyst with a high yield of 78.7 % , as shown in Scheme 1 . For comparison , the corresponding main - chain D - A conjugated copolymer of PBDT - DPP was made at the same time . The resulting PBDT - TDPP - S showed good solubility in common organic solvents , such as chlorobenzene , o - dichlorobenzene , and dichloromethane ( DCM ) , but PBDT - DPP was nearly not soluble in them .

The first one at ∼ 420 nm corresponds to the π - π * transition of the polymeric backbone in short wavelength region . The second one at ∼ 590 nm in long wavelength region is attributed to the ICT interaction between the donor unit in the main chain and the acceptor unit at the side chain . Compared with the absorption spectrum in DCM solution , the one in solid film displayed a red - shift absorption peak at 602 nm and an additional shoulder at 655 nm besides the highenergy peak . The extended absorption edge in long wavelength region can be attributed to the more aggregated configuration formed in solid state . Compared to the main - chain copolymer of PBDTDPP - OR reported by the Jo group , this side - chain copolymer of PBDT - TDPP - S exhibited a 100 nm blue - shifted maximum absorption peak . The observed blue - shifted absorption phenomenon should be related to the less planar conformation and weaker D - A interaction for the side - chain D - A copolymer than the main - chain D - A copolymer . As a result , the optical band gap ( E g opt ) of PBDT - TDPP - S was shifted to 1.73 eV as calculated from the onset of absorption spectra in the solid film . 2.3 . Electrochemical Properties . The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) curve of the PBDT - TDPP - S film coated on a platinum electrode is shown in Figure S3 ( see Supporting Information ) , and the electrochemical data are also summarized in Table 2 . An onset oxidation potential of 0.94 V and an onset reduction potential of -0.88 V ( vs SCE ) are observed .

This resulting E HOMO level is lower than those of the reported mainchain D - A copolymers of PDPP - BDT ( -5.16 eV ) and PBDTPP - OR ( -5.29 eV ) . 8 The relatively low E HOMO for PBDT - TDPP - S is beneficial to achieve high V OC in PSCs , given the strong correlation between the V OC and the difference between the E HOMO of donor and the E LUMO of acceptor in PSCs . 8 2.4 .

The resulting photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables S1 , S2 , and S3 , respectively . The optimized ratio of 1 : 1.3 , thickness of 80 nm , and annealing temperature of 120 ° C were obtained .

Device parameters , such as J SC , V OC , FF , and PCE are deduced from the J - V characteristics and summarized in Table 3 . It is clear that the PBDT - TDPP - S : PC71BM - based devices exhibited better photovoltaic properties as compared to the PBDT - TDPP - S : PC61BM - based devices , which can be attributed to the stronger absorption of PC71BM than PC61BM in the visible region from 440 to 530 nm , as shown in Figure 1b .

Up to now , the highest PCE of μmR - polymer was just 1.1 % , based on poly(di-2 - thienylthienopyrazine ) by using complicated doubled active layers photovoltaic devices . 7 The fundamental requirements for promising photovoltaic μmR - polymers include the following : ( a ) broad absorption extending to or surpassing 1 μm to absorb more sunlight ; ( b ) a high LUMO energy level to allow effective photoinduced charge transfer from the polymers to the acceptor in the BHJ device and at the same time , a low HOMO level to keep the open circuit voltage ( V OC ) as high as possible ; ( c ) high carrier mobility to ensure that effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes suppresses photocurrent loss ; and ( d ) good solubility and appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives to form high - quality films by solution processing . The lack of successful photovoltaic μmR - polymers might be due to the difficulty of fulfilling all these requirements simultaneously with one polymer . Very recently , 3,6 - dithien-2 - yl-2 , 5 - dialkylpyrrolo[3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione ( DTDPP ) was shown to be a promising building block for the design of photovoltaic polymers . 9 In our previous work , we also found the polymer , PDTP - DTDPP , based on DTDPP and dithieno[3,2 - b : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -d]pyrrole was one of potential μmRpolymers .

This new polymer , referred to as PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) , is designed to fulfill the abovementioned requirements simultaneously as much as possible .

The absorption spectrum of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) in film is shown in Figure 2 together with that of P3HT and normalized AM 1.5 G photon flux for comparison . The polymer has a broad absorption band in the range of 500 - 1100 nm with a tail extending to 1.3 μm . The full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) film is 324 nm , which is nearly a double that of P3HT film ( 158 nm ) . The optical band gap of the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) film is 1.13 eV , as estimated from the absorption onset ( 1100 nm ) . All these data indicate that PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) can utilize a larger fraction of solar light that P3HT as a possible material for applications in micrometer response photovoltaic devices . Electrochemical Properties . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was performed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of PDTP - DTDPP-(Bu ) . The CV curves were recorded referenced to an Ag / Ag þ electrode , which was calibrated against the ferroceneferrocenium ( Fc / Fc þ ) redox couple ( 4.8 eV below the vacuum level ) ; the CV curves are shown in Figure 3 . On the basis of the onset values of oxidation ( 0.10 V ) and reduction potential ( -1.17 V ) of the polymer , the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer were calculated as -4.90 and -3.63 eV , respectively . The electrochemical band gap thus determined is about 1.27 eV , which is slightly higher than the optical band gap . X - ray Diffraction ( XRD ) Measurements . The XRD patterns of the bulk samples of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH ) were recorded to understand their structures in the solid state . As shown in Figure 4 , both samples show diffraction peaks at low angles , which could be attributed to a lamellar structure . The d - spacings of the diffraction from ( 100 ) are 14.8 and 14.9 Å for PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH ) , respectively . The peaks around 24 ° for both polymers can be assigned to the face - to - face distance of the aromatic groups in the polymer chains arranged in the parallel direction . This π - π stacking distance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) was 3.64 Å , slightly lower than that of PDTP - DTDPP(EH ) ( 3.74 Å ) , which suggests that the butyl group in DPP segment is better for the close π - π stacking of the polymer backbones compared to the bulkier 2 - ethylhexyl group .

      "text": "We compared the experimental I SC under the simulated AM1.5 irradiation and the I SC calculated by integrating the EQE and the actual AM1.5 solar spectra . The calculated I SC from the EQE was 15 % less than the measured I SC . This discrepancy might be attributed to the spectral mismatch in the NIR region and / or device degradation during measurements in air . The highest PCE of PSCs based on the PDTP - DTDPP-(Bu ) : PC 70 BM system reached 2.71 % , which was lower than the 4 - 5 % of the P3HT : PCBM devices . This could be mainly attributed to the lower V OC ( ∼ 0.4 V ) . In addition , the charge separation efficiency in the current combination might not be as high as that in P3HT : PCBM , although it was difficult to estimate the internal quantum efficiency ( IQE ) accurately due to the light interference effect in the films . This might be attributed to the smaller LUMO offset or less ideal mixing morphology between the polymer and PCBM . Nevertheless , this performance is more than double of the highest PCE ( 1.1 % ) reported to date for μmR - polymers , even when the spectral mismatch in the NIR region above was considered . Such improvement of PCE comes from relatively highefficiency photon - to - electron conversion in the broad range of the absorption in the blend film of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PCBM . Considering the high EQE obtained in the range from 650 to 950 nm , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) is a promising candidate for applications in tandem photovoltaic devices in combination with conventional visible light absorbing materials . Furthermore , comparing the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) with PDTP - DTDPP(EH ) suggests that the alkyl chain in the DPP segment has a large influence on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers . A similar phenomenon was also observed for other D - A type photovoltaic polymers . 12 Synthesis of new μmR - polymers with different alkyl chain in both the DTDPP segment and the dithieno[3,2 - b : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -d]pyrrole segment and a detailed comparison of the properties of all these polymers are now in progress . The energy loss from the low output voltage of the photovoltaic devices ( 0.38 - 0.4 V ) can be attributed to the relatively large difference between the LUMO levels of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PCBM ( i.e. , small energy difference between the HOMO of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and LUMO of PCBM ) . There is still a room to lower the LUMO level of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) from 3.63 to ∼ 4.0 eV , which is ∼ 0.3 eV higher than the LUMO level of PCBM . If we can control the mixing morphology suitable for the charge separation , this energy offset might be enough to maintain a sufficient driving force for charge transfer and the higher V OC could be expected at the same time .",
