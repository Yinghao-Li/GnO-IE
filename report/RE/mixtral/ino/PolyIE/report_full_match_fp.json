PffBB - n exhibited not only strong and wide absorption but also controllable aggregation behavior in solution and thin films , in which aggregation behavior was greatly influenced by the length of alkyl side chains attached , temperature applied , and solvent used . Aggregation - induced spectral broadening further extended the absorption cutoff to ∼ 780 nm in thin films , leading to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Because of the strong aggregation strength , PffBB - n equipped with long alkyl side chains shows enhanced ordered molecular packing and good crystallinity as revealed by X - ray diffraction studies . In addition , temperature - dependent aggregation of the PffBB - n : PC71BM blend was investigated and optimized in the PSC fabrication . PSCs fabricated with the PffBB - n : PC71BM blend , conducted at 80 ° C optimized coating temperature , showed relatively high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) ranging from 8.22 to 9.93 % . The well - ordered BHJ film morphology of the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend led to superior balanced charge carrier mobility , good exciton dissociation , and the least recombination loss and hence PffBB-14 - based PSC reached the highest photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 9.93 % , a V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 and , a FF of 64.36 % . Our results demonstrated that the synergetic effect of alkyl side chain modification and processing temperature modulation to control aggregation provides practical and powerful tools to optimize the absorption broadening and optoelectronic properties of an active layer in a BHJ PSC , thus enhancing its ultimate performance . Polymeric materials show promising potential for the applications of future solar cell technology because of their advantages of solution processability , lightweight , cost efficiency , and mechanical flexibility . 1 Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) with power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) exceeding 10 % have been realized during the last decade , which was benefited from tremendous efforts on the development of advanced donor and / or acceptor materials , device engineering and optimized fabrication processes . 2 - 12 Nevertheless , the poor sunlight harvesting efficiency and low charge carrier mobility of organic semiconducting materials still hinder the further efficiency improvement of PSCs . Polythiophene ( PT ) materials have been proved to be promising donor materials as most PT materials exhibit high regioregularity for easy formation of well - organized active layer morphology , thus providing an auspicious way to develop new and efficient photovoltaic ( PV ) materials . 13 - 20 However , thiophene - based units are strongly electron - rich in nature , which often give rise to a high - lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level .",

The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the resulting polymers , PBT and PTT , were substantially stabilized when compared to those of the parent P3HT . Such energy level lowering was attributed to the integration of carboxylate and vinylene groups giving rise to a push - pull structural motif , resulting in an enhanced PCE of the PV devices based on them . 21 Over the years , the use of the structural effect to enhance PSC performance has been extensively investigated , particularly the donor - acceptor ( D - A ) strategy , which has been proved to be an effective approach to develop donor polymers with wide absorption , low - lying energy levels , and enhanced electron properties . 23 - 32 Besides , conjugation expansion on the polymer backbone is an alternative tool to improve the electronic properties of polymers . By replacing a branched 2ethylhexyl side chain with a linear n - octyl group , Zhang and his co - workers synthesized a PTB7 - Th derivative namely , PBTT . PV cells based on PBTT : IEICO showed a superior device performance than that of the PTB7 - Th - based device with a PCE of 9.5 % , a V oc of 0.86 V , a J sc of 17.9 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 61.3 % . Such dramatic enhancement in efficiency was attributed to a higher charge mobility and improved morphology of the PBTT : IEICO blend film induced by the less steric hindered linear alkyl side chain . 1 Yang and coworkers used selenophene to replace thiophene π - bridge in the indacenodithiophene ( IDT)-benzo[1,2 - c:4,5 - c′]dithiophene-4,8 - dione ( BDD)-based copolymer ( PThBDDIDT ) to develop a donor - π - acceptor type copolymer , PSeBDDIDT . The PCE of solar cells based on polymer : PC71BM as an active layer was dramatically increased from 7.04 to 8.65 % , respectively . Such improvement could result from stronger intermolecular interactions , expanded absorption range , and better molecular planarity of selenophene contained PSeBDDIDT . 33 Random terpolymers comprised of thieno[2′,3′ : 5′,6′]pyrido [ 3,4- g]- thieno[3,2 - c]isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione , thiophene ( T ) , and dithiophene ( 2 T ) were synthesized by Yang and co - workers in which the crystallinity of terpolymers could be controlled by varying the compositions of T and 2T. The PSC based on a terpolymer with the optimized T / 2 T ratio of 7 : 3 showed a high J sc of 18.3 mA cm^-2 and a FF of 71.2 % , thus resulting in an enhanced PCE up to 10.8 % . 34 Fluorination on polymer backbones has also been widely adopted to tune and improve the functional properties of donor polymers such as stabilization of their energy levels and hence positively impacting on PSC performance .",

The PSC based on J91 / m - ITIC as an active layer with thermal annealing gave a high PCE of 11.63 % with a high V oc of 0.98 V and a J sc of 18.03 mA cm^-2 . 36 The improved cell performance was attributed to the suppression of carrier recombination imposed by the difluorosubstituted side chain . In addition to influencing molecular and functional properties of donor polymers , the structural modification could lead to severe aggregation , which could hamper solution processability of a polymer . On the other hand , aggregation could be desirable and provide a useful tool to control the bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) film morphology and then the photovoltaic performance of a solar cell . Yan and co - workers employed the branched alkyl chains attached on the backbone of the difluorobenzothiadiazole - quaterthiophene ( PffBT4 T ) copolymer to acquire desirable temperature - dependent aggregation behavior . By spin - casting the polymer solution at an elevated temperature , they could control the morphology and crystallinity of the polymer films . Taking advantage of this aggregation control approach , high - performance PSCs based on PffBT4T-2OD : PC71BM were fabricated affording a PCE of up to 10.8 % . 9 Guo and co - workers used a number of fused thiophene spacers to tune the aggregation behavior of difluorobenzoxadiazole ( ffBX)-based donor polymers among which PffBX - TT with thieno[3,2 - b]thiophene as a spacer showed intermediate temperature - dependent aggregation strength allowing the control of blend film morphology during PSC fabrication . PSCs using PffBX - TT : PC71BM as an active layer gave a maximum PCE of 9.10 % . 37 Previously , we developed a class of benzodithiophene - based donor polymers with fluoro - dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole being an acceptor unit that showed interesting temperature - dependent aggregation behavior when equipped with linear alkyl side chains . PSCs based on these polymers : PC71BM blend layers showed good photovoltaic performance with a maximum PCE as high as 9.70 % . 38 In this contribution , we reported a new series of donor polymer materials based on benzodithiophene ( BDT ) and difluorinated dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole , PffBB - n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16 ) , which exhibited strong aggregation behavior in both solution and thin films . In addition to the size of alkyl side chains attached on the backbone of the polymer , aggregation can be modulated by the solvent used and temperature applied on the film with which the absorption cut - off extended down to ∼ 780 nm in thin films , resulting in a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Such wide absorption is desirable and complementary to that of the commonly used PC71BM acceptor material in the visible light region , which can increase light harvesting in BHJ PSCs .",

Such a superior device efficiency was attributed to the greatly enhanced exciton dissociation , higher and balanced charge carrier mobilities , and less recombination losses in the active layer of the PffBB-14 : PC71BM - based cells . Our results demonstrated that the modulation of aggregation behavior through structural modification and temperature tuning could effectively optimize the physical and optoelectronic properties of a material and device for solar cell applications . Synthesis and Physical Properties of Polymers . The PffBB - n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16 ) polymers were synthesized according to the optimized literature procedures and the synthetic scheme is shown in Scheme 1.^39 The Corey - House synthesis of 3 - bromothiophene and oxalyl dichloride gave 1,2di(thiophen-3 - yl)ethane-1,2 - dione ( 1 ) as a brown needle - like crystal in a good yield ( 70 % ) . Oxidative cyclization of 1 in the presence of iron(III ) chloride carried out in diluted dichloromethane ( DCM ) solution yielded a dark purple benzodithiophene-4,5 - diketone ( 2 ) crystal . Acetylation of 2 with Zn powder and acetic anhydride performed under basic conditions produced yellowish benzodithiophene-4,5 - diyl diacetate ( 3 ) powder in a good yield of 85 % . 3 was then alkylated with 2ethylhexyl bromide in the presence of Cs 2 CO 3 yielding 4,5bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)benzodithiophene ( 4 ) as a sticky colorless liquid . Proton abstraction of 4 by n - BuLi followed by the reaction with tri - butyltin chloride gave the polycondensation precursor , 4,5 - bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)-2,7 - bis(tri - n - butylstannyl)benzodithiophene ( 5 ) . To preserve high reactivity , the crude product was subjected to flash chromatography and kept under -20 ° C for the condensation reaction . Alkylation of the thiophene ring was carried out by Kumada coupling , yielding 3 - alkylthiophene as a colorless oil or a white solid ( 6 - 9 ) . Lithiation of alkylated thiophene followed by quenching with tri - butyltin chloride afforded tri - butyl(4alkylthiophene-2 - yl)stannane ( 10 - 13 ) . Subsequent coupling with 4,7 - dibromo-5,6 - difluorobenzo[c ] [ 1,2,5]thiadiazole afforded dithienyl - substituted difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole , 14 - 17 . NBS bromination of 14 - 17 produced the acceptor units , 18 - 21 , respectively , which were carefully purified through chromatography and recrystallization to ensure high reactivity for the condensation reaction . The Stille polycondensation reaction of donor unit 5 and acceptor units 18 - 21 was carried out under the catalyst of Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 in chlorobenzene solutions at 150 ° C for 3 days that could afford the corresponding polymers as a dark green solid . Gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) was used to determine the molecular weight using polystyrene as the standard and 1,2,3 - trichlorobenzene as the eluent ( Table 1 ) .",

Density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations was carried out to probe the molecular and electronic properties of the PffBB - n polymer by means of B3LYP / 6 - 311+(d , p ) as a basis set in a vacuum using the repeating conjugated units of the polymer backbone in which all of the alkyl substitutions were replaced by ethyl groups to reduce the calculation time . Figure 2 displays the optimized molecular conformation and the frontier molecular orbitals of the ethyl - substituted repeating units of PffBB - n. The dihedral angle between the BDT electron - donating unit and the electron - deficient unit was found to be ∼ 26.9 ° in the optimized structure , which is caused by the ethyl substitution on the thienyl ring . The HOMO delocalizes extensively over the π - conjugation framework , whereas the LUMO mainly populated on the benzothiadiazole Article unit . Such frontier molecular orbital electron distribution would greatly enhance efficient intramolecular charge transfer . The electrochemical properties of PffBB - n were determined by cyclic voltammetry . Their results are summarized in Table 2 , and the respective energy levels are delineated in Figure 2d . The HOMO energy levels of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 were estimated from the onset oxidation potential to be -5.66 , -5.73 , -5.72 , and -5.78 eV , respectively . The corresponding LUMO energy levels were calculated from the HOMO energy level and the onset absorption of polymers in thin films , which were -4.01 , -4.11 , -4.11 , and -4.16 eV , respectively . As a result , the HOMO energy levels of PffBB - n polymers are much lower than that of ITO and their corresponding LUMO energy levels of PffBB - n lied slightly above that of PC71BM . Such energy level alignment would facilitate charge transfer from the donor polymer to the PC71BM acceptor and provide a relatively large difference between the HOMO energy level of donor polymers and the LUMO level of PC71BM , which is important to achieve a large V oc of a solar device . As a result , BHJ PSCs fabricated from these polymers are promising to achieve high device performance . X - Ray Diffraction ( XRD ) . X - ray diffraction measurements were carried out to determine the crystallinity of PffBB - n polymers and the XRD spectra are shown in Figure 3 . Despite various sizes of alkyl side chains attached , polymers with the same backbone show very similar XRD patterns . The sharp peaks at around 5 ° correspond to the in - plane spacing ( d 1spacing ) between the polymer backbones , whereas the broad peaks lying above 20 ° ( d 2 -spacing ) is characterized as a π - π stacking distance .",

The decrease in both the J sc and FF could be due to inferior polymer chain packing in the active layer leading to a poor charge transporting network . Besides , the device performance generally varied with the length of alkyl side chains attached onto the polymer backbone . The device efficiency initially increases upon the incorporation of longer alkyl side chains from decyl to tetradecyl reaching a maximum at tetradecyl - substituted PffBB-14 and then declines with further alkyl side chain extension . Importantly , such chain Article length - dependent device performance trend is spin - coating temperature independent . The champion PffBB-14 - based device affords the highest PCE of 9.93 % with a V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36 % . The size of the alkyl side chain is known to affect the processability and interchain interactions of a polymer , which would provide a tool to optimize the π - π stacking interactions of a polymer in the solid state . A size - optimized alkyl side chain would provide a good balance between the π - π stacking interactions of the polymer backbone and the alkyl - alkyl side chain interactions resulting in a highly ordered molecular packing for efficient charge transport . Figure 5a shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of PffBB - n / PC71BM - based PSCs . Strong and broad photo - to - current responses were observed in the range from 330 to 780 nm in all of these PSCs , in which the absorption above 650 nm was attributed to the polymer aggregationinduced absorption broadening . Remarkably , the PffBB-14based device exhibited a much higher photoconversion Article response ranging from 350 to 500 nm than those of other devices , thus affording the highest J sc among all of these devices . As PffBB - n polymers showed similar absorption properties , the high current density of PffBB-14 - based PSC would result from well - ordered polymer : PC71BMnetwork / packing . J sc derived from the EQE spectra were estimated to be 14.12 , 14.92 , 16.29 , and 14.21 mA cm^-2 for PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based devices , respectively , which were in good agreement with those obtained from J - V characterization ( Figure 6 ) . Charge Transfer and Recombination . The charge carrier mobilities of PffBB - n - based devices were estimated on hole - only and electron - only devices using the space - chargelimited current ( SCLC ) model , and the results are summarized in Table 4 . Indeed , the highest and well - balanced charge carrier mobility of the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend affords a higher J sc and FF than those of other devices . Charge dissociation probability was characterized by photogenerated current density ( J ph ) vs effective applied voltage ( V eff ) measurements .",

V eff = V 0 - V , where V 0 is the voltage at which J L = J D and V is the applied voltage . When the reverse voltage is greater than 2 V , recombination will be suppressed because of a high internal electric field and thus the current density becomes saturated ( J sat ) . Consequently , P(E , T ) = J ph / J sat could be used to describe the charge dissociation probability . The charge dissociation probability of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based cells was estimated to be 0.86 , 0.94 , 0.98 , and 0.92 , respectively . The highest exciton dissociation of the PffBB-14 - based device is anticipated to give rise to the best photovoltaic performance among these series of polymers . Figure 7 demonstrates the dependence of V oc and J sc against light intensity , which could be used to describe the recombination process in BHJ films . The V oc is directly proportional to the incident light intensity in the semilogarithmic plot with a slope of kT / q , which describes bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film , where k represents the Boltzmann constant , T is the Kelvin temperature , and q is the elementary charge . Trap - assisted recombination exists if the slope is larger than kT / q. 42 Among devices fabricated , the PffBB-14 - based cell exhibited the smallest slope of 1.10 kT / q , suggesting the least trap - assisted recombination . Bimolecular recombination was also investigated by measuring the dependence of J sc against light intensity , in which the exponential factor α in the power law of J sc ∝ P light α is used Article to indicate bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film . The closer the estimated α to 1.0 , the weaker the bimolecular recombination occurs in the device . 43 Obviously , with α = 0.98 , the PffBB-14 - based device would exhibit the least occurrence of bimolecular recombination in the active layer . In contrast , the PffBB-10 - based device showed an α value of 0.86 , indicating that the bimolecular recombination loss was severe in its BHJ film . These results consistently indicate that the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend with superior balanced charge carrier transport exhibits the least recombination loss among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs , thus affording the highest J sc and FF . Morphology of the Active Layer . AFM images of PffBBn : PC71BM blended thin films were obtained to investigate their microphase separation behavior and the corresponding AFM height and phase images recorded in the tapping mode are shown in Figure 8 .

In short , AFM results confirm that the PffBB-14 : PC71BM blend layer exhibited a desirable morphology for efficient photovoltaic properties . Our results also indicated that the extremely strong aggregation strength of the donor polymer would hinder for the formation of a desirable homogeneous donor / acceptor interpenetration network for efficient photovoltaic performance .

Such an excellent device performance was attributed to the strong and aggregation - broadened absorption , superior exciton dissociation , desirable film morphology , better balanced charge carrier mobilities , and minimal recombination loss . Our results demonstrated that the side chain length modification and processing temperature modulation were proved to be useful for tuning polymer interchain interactions , absorption properties , active layer morphology , and charge carrier properties , thus optimizing the ultimate device performance of BHJ PSCs .

The optical band gaps of the polymers could be tuned from 1.41 eV to 1.61 eV by changing the number of thiophene spacers . Electrochemical measurements showed that the increase of band gap is mainly due to the change of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level . The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymer solar cells based on the three polymers and PC 70 BM reached 3.12 % with x = 2 under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . This approach could provide a simple strategy for designing high - performance D - A type photovoltaic polymers based on the existing polymers and a large potential to improve their performance further . † Electronic supplementary information ( ESI ) available : XRD patterns , DFT and TD - DFT calculations . See Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted much interest due to their great potential to be a renewable energy technology based on simple and low cost manufacture . [ 1][2][3 ] The concept of a bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) utilizing mixtures of a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative is regarded as an efficient system for photovoltaic application . 4 The most representative active layers of the blend of regioregular poly(3 - hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT ) with fullerene derivatives were extensively investigated . [ 5][6][7 ] While the advantage of P3HT is its simple structure with a relatively high hole mobility , the weak point of P3HT as the photovoltaic donor material towards efficient PSCs is the mismatch of its absorption spectrum ( absorption edge is about 650 nm ) with the terrestrial solar spectrum . The band gap of P3HT ( 1.9 eV ) is larger than the optimum band gap range ( 1.3 - 1.5 eV ) for polymer - fullerene BHJ solar cells . 8 Hence , design of photovoltaic polymers with broader absorption toward longer wavelengths , especially in the near - infrared ( NIR ) range , is necessary for high efficiency conjugated polymer donor materials . Thanks to the many attempts that have been made to develop NIR absorbing polymers , a notable improvement of the overall power - conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been achieved . [ 9][10][11 ] One of the most powerful and flexible strategies to design low band gap conjugated polymers involves an alternating sequence of electron - donor ( D ) and electron - acceptor ( A ) moieties along the conjugated polymer main chain .",

Such a D - A strategy is now widely used as one of the most promising approaches to design efficient polymers for application to the polymer photovoltaic . Thiophene is a simple and fundamental block to construct new D - A type copolymers . Recently , the bridged dithiophene has attracted considerable attention as a donor unit because of its ability to fix the dithiophene system into a planar structure , which is much more efficient than the dithiophene in constructing highly - conjugated copolymers . Four bridging dithiophene units with the atoms of carbon ( C ) , silicon ( Si ) , germanium ( Ge ) and nitrogen ( N ) afford cyclopenta[2,1 - b;3,4 - b′]dithiophene ( CPDT ) , dithienosilole ( DTS ) , dithienogermole ( DTG ) and dithieno [ 3,2- b : 2′,3′-d]pyrrole ( DTP ) , respectively . CPDT was first introduced into the low band gap polymers , and the corresponding copolymer alternating CPDT with benzothiadiazole showed a PCE of 5.5 % , after using a small amount of alkanedithiols to control the morphology of the blend film . 14,15 Later on , large amounts of CPDT - based photovoltaic polymers were designed and synthesized . [ 16][17][18][19][20 ] In comparison with the C - C bond , a longer C - Si bond shows less steric hindrance , which directly resulted in better π - π stacking along the conjugated polymer backbones . 21,22 Polymers based on DTS normally have high hole mobility and strong light absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum and hence the improvement in photovoltaic performance , which reached 5.1 % . 12 DTG shows lower intermolecular steric hindrance than DTS because of the longer C - Ge bond compared to the C - Si , resulting in the corresponding DTG - containing solar cells exhibiting higher short - current and fill factor . [ 23][24][25 ] Planar dithieno[3,2 - b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole ( DTP ) , with good π - conjugation , showed great potential for use in organic electronic materials . 26 D - A type photovoltaic polymers with DTP as the electron - donating unit , exhibiting low band gap and enhanced solubility , have been intensively applied to PSCs . 27,28 In our previous study , PSCs based on DTP - containing copolymers and PC 70 BM showed a short - circuit current as high as 22.6 mA cm^-1 , 29 indicating that DTP - containing copolymers could be promising building blocks for superior photovoltaic performance . On the other hand , benzothiadiazole ( BT ) containing the electron - withdrawing imine ( -CvN- ) nitrogen has been widely used as a strong acceptor in D - A copolymers . 30,31 Numerous attempts to develop novel D - A copolymers have shown that 4,7 - dithien-2 - yl-2,1,3 - benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) is an effective acceptor unit , and photovoltaic devices made from blends with fullerene derivatives show PCE up to 5.4 % .",

In this regard , a simple and effective method might be to tune the properties of D - A type photovoltaic polymers by introducing thienyl groups as spacers between donor and acceptor segments in the backbone . In this study , three kinds of low band gap copolymers integrating DTP as the donor block and the most - used BT as the acceptor unit were synthesized . Different numbers of thienyl ( T ) as spacers were introduced along the copolymer main chain to investigate the effect on optical , electrochemical and photovoltaic performance . [ 6,6]-Phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) was used as an acceptor in the blended film of copolymers : PC 70 BM . Different solvents ( chlorobenzene ( CB ) and 1,2 - dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) ) were tested to build an optimized interpenetrated network in the active film , and the corresponding film properties and the photovoltaic device performance are discussed in detail . Fig . 1 shows the optical absorption spectra of PDTP - BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT in CHCl 3 solution and in thin films spin - coated on quartz plates . The absorption maximum wavelength in the solutions and the films and the optical band gap deduced from the absorption onsets are summarized in Table 1 . Judging from the splitting of the absorption bands , it can be speculated that the polymers have the typical absorption characteristics of D - A type copolymers with π - π * and charge transfer - type transitions . Comparing the polymers PDTP - BT and PDTP - DT2BT with the previously synthesized polymer PDTP - DTBT , 27 the difference in their absorption is distinct . The PDTP - DTBT solution showed two prominent absorption maxima at 450 and 671 nm , while PDTP - BT and PDTP - DT2BT solutions demonstrated two main absorption maxima at 413 and 711 nm and at 480 and 603 nm , respectively . Although the absorption peaks in the Scheme 1 Synthetic route of three dithienopyrrole - based donor - acceptor type copolymers with thienyl spacers . long wavelength blue - shifted by 40 nm and 108 nm with insertion of one and two thienyl spacers to PDTP - BT , the absorption coefficients at the absorption maxima increase from 3.6 × 10 ^ 4 ( PDTP - BT ) to 4.0 × 10 ^ 4 ( PDTP - DTBT ) and 4.7 × 10 ^ 4 L mol^-1 cm^-1 ( PDTP - DT2BT ) , respectively .

These results suggest that on the absorption of the polymers , both absorption peaks and absorption coefficients could be readily controlled by tailoring the number of thienyl spacers along the polymers . 37,39,40 The absorption edge shifts from ca . 900 nm in PDTP - BT to ca . 850 nm in PDTP - DTBT and ca . 750 nm in PDTP - DT2BT , reflecting the broadening of the optical band - gap in sequence . Table 1 shows the optical band - gaps ( E opt g ) of all polymers estimated from the corresponding UV - vis absorption onset . PDTP - DT2BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - BT have optical band gaps of 1.61 , 1.46 and 1.41 eV , respectively , which are close to the ideal value of 1.5 eV for PSC application . These changes of the absorption spectra upon the introduction of thienyl groups can be qualitatively understood from density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations of the corresponding model compounds ( Fig . S1 † ) . The optimized structures show that all the polymer backbones are mostly planar . Time dependent DFT calculations show that the absorption band in the longer wavelength is mainly attributed to the transition from HOMO delocalized in the D - A backbone to LUMO localized in DTP units for all the polymers . On the other hand , the absorption in the shorter wavelength is largely contributed by the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1 , which is similar to π - π * transition in polythiophene judging by the shape of the orbitals . Therefore , the introduction of more thienyl spacer could stabilize LUMO+1 ( π * ) due to the better conjugation , resulting in the red - shift of the absorption band . At the same time , it could decrease the D - A nature of the polymer due to the weaker electron acceptability of DTP , resulting in the blueshift of the charge transfer bands . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the polymers and estimate the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers . Representative cyclic voltammogram ( CV ) curves of these copolymers are shown in Fig . 2 Crystalline order of the copolymer thin films was investigated by X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) scans ( Fig . S2 † ) . In the out - of - plane measurement , the XRD pattern of PDTP - BT reveals a weak peak near 6 ° , and there is no clear peak for PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT , suggesting that they exhibit amorphous structures in the film , which might be due to the bulky side chain in the DTP building block . A change in the number of thienyl spacers in this system does not significantly affect the aggregation behaviour of the polymer main chains .",

Here , the atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was applied to investigate the morphology of the blend film of the polymer : PC 70 BM fabricated from CB and DCB solutions , respectively , as shown in Fig . 3 . For PDTP - BT : PC 70 BM , both CB and DCB gave the films with obvious phase separation with a root mean square ( RMS ) of 2.222 nm and 0.880 nm , respectively , which might be due to the poor miscibility of the two materials . For PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT , the blend film of polymer / PC 70 BM spin - coated from CB was also rough , but the blend films fabricated from DCB displayed a much smoother surface with a RMS of 0.188 nm and 0.259 nm , respectively . This smaller roughness of the blend film indicates that the domain size of the phase separation of the donor - acceptor interpenetrating network could be reduced , which could be beneficial for the exciton charge separation and charge transport . These results indicate that the morphologies of these polymers with PC 70 BM are quite sensitive to the solvents used for device processing and the introduction of a thienyl spacer could improve the miscibility . The photovoltaic properties of the three copolymers PDTP - BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP - DT2BT were studied by fabricating bulk heterojunction BHJ - type PSCs with a conventional sandwich configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC 70 BM / Ca / Al . The effective areas of the PSCs , contributing to photocurrent , were defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light . The devices were optimized by changing many factors , such as the ratio of the donor and the acceptor , the thickness of blend films and the cathode metal . The best performance was obtained with the thickness of the active layer of 80 - 90 nm , the copolymers : PC 70 BM ratio of 1 : 2 ( by weight ) and the Ca / Al used as the cathode .

The V OC values of the devices are around 0.5 V , suggesting that the addition of the thienyl units does not affect the main chain distortion . This coincides well with similar HOMO energy levels for the copolymers measured by CV . These results indicate that the PCEs of the photovoltaic devices based on PDTP - DT2BT : PC 70 BM were higher than those of PDTP - DTBT : PC 70 BM and PDTP - BT : PC 70 BM .

The shapes of the EQE curves of the devices in the range of 450 - 700 nm could be assigned to the stronger absorption of PC 70 BM .

The newly developed DTPD moiety was carefully designed to lower a band gap via strong interaction between donor - acceptor moieties and keep polymer energy levels deep . Remarkably , the DTPD acceptor moiety effectively widens the light absorption range of the polymers up to ∼ 900 nm while positioning their HOMO and LUMO levels in the optimal range , i.e. , -5.3 and -4.0 eV , respectively , for high power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as we intended . Solar cell devices were fabricated according to the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / photoactive ( polymer : PC 70 BM ) / TiO 2 / Al . The POBDTPD devices exhibited a PCE of 4.7 % with a V oc of 0.70 V , a J sc of 10.6 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.64 .

Optical Properties and Electronic Structures . The UV - vis absorption spectra of POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers in a chlorobenzene solution or in a thin film state are shown in Figure 1a . The absorption peaks and optical band gaps are summarized in Table 1 . POBDTPD and PEBDTPD in solution showed similar characteristics , covering a wide range absorption band of 300 - 900 nm . A strong absorption was observed at short wavelengths with a maximum peak at ∼ 490 nm ; a broad absorption peak was observed over the longer wavelength range of 550 - 900 nm . The lower absorption of POBDTPD in 550 - 900 nm is presumably related with the higher fraction of lower molecular weighted POBDTPD polymer chains compared to the PEBDTPD . 46 POBDTPD and PEBDTPD films also showed similar absorption bandwidth and shape . However , there was a pronounced difference that the PEBDTPD film showed a higher extinction coefficient ( 4.1 × 10 ^ 4 cm^-1 at the peak of 675 nm ) than the POBDTPD ( 2.6 × 10 ^ 4 cm^-1 at the peak of 673 nm ) , reflecting that the polymer chain packing in PEBDTPD film is better than that in POBDTPD . Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements were carried out to determine the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers . The cyclic voltammograms of the polymers and energy level diagram for the materials used in the study are shown in Figures 2 and 1b , respectively . The oxidation and reduction potentials and the electrochemical band gaps ( E g EC ) of the polymers are summarized in Table 1 . The HOMO levels of the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers were -5.23 and -5.37 eV , respectively . Interestingly , the branched alkyl chains of 2ethylhexyloxy groups stabilized the HOMO level slightly more than the linear alkyl chains of octyloxy groups , which is in line with previous reports . 47 - 50 The LUMO levels of POBDTPD and PEBDTPD were -4.00 and -4.06 eV , respectively . This less dependence of the polymer LUMO level on substituted alkyl chains is again consistent with the previous report . 47 This different dependence of the HOMO or LUMO levels on the substituted alkyl chains might be originated from the fact that the alkoxy chains affect the position of the HOMO level than the LUMO level since they participate to some degree in the construction of HOMO but does little in the formation of LUMO according to our DFT calculation ( Figure 3 ) . It should be noted that the LUMO levels are on the borderline for fast electron transfer to PC 70 BM whose LUMO level is -4.3 eV. 51 This result indicated that the DTPD acted as a very strong electron - withdrawing unit in donor - acceptor - type low band gap polymers , as predicted in the DFT calculation .",

To understand the reasons of the higher J sc and the lower FF in the PEBDTPD device , as compared with the POBDTPD device more specifically , we investigated film morphology , exciton separation , and carrier mobility in the polymer films and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films .

In conclusion , we synthesized the low band gap POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers that consist of dialkoxybenzodithiophene ( BDT ) as the donor and N - octyl-2,7 - dithia-5azacyclopenta[a]pentalene-4,6 - dione ( DTPD ) as the acceptor . The DTPD acceptor moieties allow the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers to have a low band gap ( ∼ 900 nm ) and optimal HOMO and LUMO levels alignment for PSCs , yielding the PCEs of 4.7 and 5.3 % , respectively . In this study , we demonstrate , for the first time , that the DTPD unit is a promising electron - withdrawing building block for low band gap polymers , and it can be utilized to tailor the optical and electronic properties of conjugated polymers for photovoltaic devices and many other applications in plastic electronics .",

      "text": "In an attempt to further improve the performance of the PCDTBT - based polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , we have synthesized a selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , PCDSeBT , in which diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ( DSeBT ) monomer alternately flanks with a 2,7 - carbazole unit . The intrinsic properties of PCDSeBT are not only characterized by UV - vis absorption , cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) , and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) but also the surface morphology , mobilities of space charge - limited current ( SCLC ) model , and polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) in its bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) active layer with [ 6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) are evaluated in detail . It is found that PCDSeBT simultaneously has a low - lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level at -5.4 eV and a low bandgap of 1.70 eV as required by the ideal polymers for BHJ PSCs . The high current of 11.7 mA / cm^2 is obtained for PCDSeBT - based PSCs , to our knowledge , which is among the highest short - circuit current density ( J SC ) values obtained from a BHJ device consisting of PCDTBT derivatives and [ 6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) . The high J SC value , along with a moderate fill factor ( FF ) of 45 % and a high open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.79 V , yields a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 4.12 % , which is about 37 % increase in PCE from a PCDTBT - based reference device . On the basis of our results , one can be concluded that the DSeBT placement for construction of donor ( D)-acceptor ( A ) polymers is an easy and effective way to realize both the higher J SC and V OC values in PSCs , as a consequence of the selective lower - lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) with the HOMO being almost unchanged , together with the effective broadening on the absorption band . With deep understanding of efficient photoinduced electron transfer within an interpenetrating network by simple blending π - conjugated polymers ( electron donor ) with fullerene derivatives ( electron acceptor ) , 1 bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on poly(3 - hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT ) : [ 6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) have been extensively investigated , leading to great progress in power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of 4 - 5 % . 2 Yet , the PCE of P3HT - based PSCs is limited by its relatively large bandgap ( ∼ 1.9 eV ) with major loss of the solar radiation as well as low open circuit - voltage ( V OC ≅ 0.6 V ) due to the relatively small energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of P3HT and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of PCBM .",

      "text": "By taking into consideration using low bandgap polymers to harvest more solar photons , researchers have devoted much effort recently to reducing the bandgap of polymers . This approach has provided a remarkable short - circuit current density ( J SC ) of 16 mA / cm^2 , 3 whereas , in general , the V OC has suffered 4 because of a higher than the HOMO optimal energy level in order to pursue a lower bandgap . In the PSCs community , poly(2,7 - carbazole - altdithienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDTBT ) is one excellent exam - ple for a low HOMO ( -5.45 eV ) as required by the ' ideal ' πconjugated polymers , which led to a high V OC value over 0.8 V and outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures . 5 The initial PCE reached 3.6 % 6 in a typical BHJ device and has been subsequently improved to exceeding 6 % by BHJ layer thickness optimization and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures . 7 However , the bandgap of PCDTBT is still relatively larger than the proposed 1.5 - 1.7 eV of the ideal polymers for PCEs exceeding 10 % . Recently , to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT without sacrificing its high V OC , Hsu et al . 8 and our group 9 independently reported PCDTBT - based ladder - type polymers with forced planarity of which device performance showed impressive PCEs of up to 4.59 % with reduced bandgap ( ca . 0.2 eV ) in comparison with that of PCDTBT . However , the multiple synthetic steps for the ladder - type PCDTBTs have restricted the realization for their usage in BHJ devices . Herein , we present an easily obtainable selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , poly(2,7 - carbazole - alt - diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDSeBT ) by replacing thiophenes with selenophene rings in the polymer backbone . Such a structural modification would be expected the lower - lying LUMO with the HOMO being largely unaffected due to the individual effects of the smaller ionization potential ( IP ) and almost the same electronegativity of selenium relative to sulfur atom . 10 In addition , interchain - charge transfer should be facilitated by intermolecular Se ° ° ° Se contacts , most likely leading to a widen absorption band and enhanced mobility that are desirable for high photocurrents . 11 Our preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic properties of PCDSeBT in typical BHJ devices with [ 6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) shows a highly respectrable PCE of 4.12 % on account of the high J SC and V OC . The synthetic routes to the monomers ( M1 and M2 ) and PCDSeBT are shown in Scheme 1 . Compounds 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were synthesized according to the previously reported procedures . 5a,12 The diboronic ester monomer M1 was easily synthesized from precursor 3 , by dilithiation at -78 ° C , followed by quenching with 2 - iso - propoxy-4,4,5,5 - tetrametyl-1,3,2 - dioxaborolane in anhydrous THF in a yield of 79 % .",

The target poly(2,7 - carbazole - alt - diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ) ( PCDSeBT ) was obtained by Suzuki polymerization of M1 and M2 in degassed toluene / water with K 3 PO 4 as an organic base , Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 as a catalyst , and P(o - tol ) 3 as the corresponding ligand at 90 ° C for 3 days . The crude polymer was purified by reprecipitation and Soxhlet extraction with methanol , acetone , hexane , and chlorobenzene . Details of synthesis of monomers , polymerization , and their characterizations are given in the Experimental Section . After purification , gel - permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis against PS standard exhibits a number - averaged molecular mass ( M n ) of 83 ^ 000 g / mol with a polydispersity ( PDI ) of 2.51 . The polymer is readily soluble in common solvents such as chloroform , toluene , THF , and chlorobenzene . As shown in Figure 1a , the UV - vis absorption spectra of PCDSeBT both in chloroform solution and solid state exhibit two distinct absorption bands , as typically observed for donor ( D)-acceptor ( A ) low bandgap materials . The absorption maxima ( λ max ) of the film are located at 403 and 589 nm . The shorter absorption band is due to π - π * transitions of the polymer backbone , 13 while the lower - energy peak is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) in the electron - rich and electron - deficient units . 14 It is worth noting that the maxima absorption values of PCDSeBT in the film are slightly broadened without any obvious red - shift when compared to the solution . This verifies that only a small reorganization via π - π stacking between the polymer chains is within view during the film formation because of the interchain aggregates in solution . 15 This observation is in contrast to many conjugated polymers , in which there is a red - shift that occurs in going from the solution to the solid state due to the aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state , 3,16 even the PCDTBT film is red - shifted by 30 nm vs solution . 5a Besides , the deep blue color of PCDSeBT solution is observed unlike the red color of PCDTBT in solution ( see the digital photograph in Figure 1a ) . Notably , although the absorption profile of PCDSeBT is similar to that of the thiophene analogue , PCDTBT , the absorption onset of PCDSeBT is significantly red - shifted by ∼ 70 nm , corresponding to a lower optical bandgap ( E g opt = 1.70 eV ) than PCDTBT ( E g opt = 1.85 eV ) .",

      "text": "This apparently demonstrates that , in agreement with earlier studies and experimental studies , 17 the replacement of thiophene with selenophene results in a reduction of the optical bandgap due to the increase of quinoid character in the polymer backbone . 18 In a closer look of the film absorptions , it is also found that the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of PCDSeBT ( 155 nm ) is wider than that of PDCTBT ( 140 nm ) , as a matter of a characteristic of strong intermolecular Se ° ° ° Se interactions , which can potentially further increase J SC value . The electrochemical properties of PCDSeBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) . As shown in Figure 1b , PCDSeBT exhibits clear reversible n - doping / dedoping processes in the negative potential range , whereas quasi - reversible p - doping / dedoping behaviors in the positive potential range are observed . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be -5.40 eV and -3.70 eV , respectively , using the ferrocene - ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc+ ) redox couple ( 4.8 eV below the vacuum level ) . Both PCDTBT and PCDSeBT have nearly identical HOMO energy levels , but PCDSeBT exhibits 0.10 eV lower - lying LUMO level relative to PCDTBT ( LUMO = -3.60 eV , see also Supporting Information ) , 5a verifying our presumption aforementioned about the effect of selenium on the selective fine - tuning of LUMO level . The material - design rules described by Scharber et al . 19 suggested that the PCEs of a BHJ solar cell should be much more sensitive to changes of the donor LUMO level compared to variations of the donor bandgap . On the basis of the rules , the estimated PCE from the E g opt and the LUMO value of PCDSeBT is 7.8 % . This theoretical value is much higher than that of PCDTBT ( 6.5 % ) , indicating that a highly promising material for PSCs considering the frontier orbital energies . Upon utilizing a model dimeric system containing methyl groups , the optimized molecular geometry of PCDSeBT and its frontier molecular orbitals of the calculated HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces were computed by density functional theory ( DFT , B3LYP / 6 - 31 G ) ( Figure 1d ) . The HOMO of PCDSeBT is well - distributed along the conjugated chains ; its LUMO is mainly centralized on BT accepting core as shaped by orbital lobes , being predicted a p - type organic semiconductor . In order to corroborate the effect of the heteroatom substitution on charge transporting properties of the polymers , top - contact organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) were fabricated using solution processed PCDTBT and PCDSeBT , respectively , as the semiconducting layer on the octadecyltrichlorosilane ( OTS ) self - assembled monolayer ( SAM)-modified Si / SiO 2 substrates ( see the detailed devices fabrication in the Experimental Section ) .",

The summary of the performances is provided in Table 1 . I ds = ( W / 2L ) × μ × C i ( V gs - V th ) The OFET device using as - cast PCDTBT films without thermal annealing exhibits a hole mobility of 2.2 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 / V ° s with an on / off current ratio ( I on / I off ) of 4.44 × 10 ^ 3 . For PCDTBT thin films after annealing at evaluated temperatures , the mobilities are not markedly improved , implying that the PCDTBT thin films remain nearly amorphous for both as - cast and annealing at high temperature . On the other hand , it is found that the unannealed thin films of PCDSeBT exhibit a slightly higher mobility of μ h = 5.1 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 / V ° s , compared with that of pristine PCDTBT . Interestingly , in contrast , as the PCDSeBT thin films are annealed at a temperature of 120 and 150 ° C , the mobilities are systematically improved up to 1.0 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 / V ° s ( Figure 2b ) , which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of PCDTBT , possibly due to increased interpolymer chain contact induced by Se ° ° ° Se interactions with the thermal annealing process . To gain a better understanding of the influence of the thermal annealing , the crystallinity and molecular organization of PCDTBT and PCDSeBT thin films were investigated by Xray diffraction ( XRD ) , both before and after annealing at 150 ° C . Both the as - cast and annealed PCDTBT thin films fail to reveal any defined scattering patterns ( Figure 3a ) , indicating the macroscopically disordered , amorphous structure . In the case of PCDSeBT , the as - cast thin films show very weak diffractions ( Figure 3b ) . Upon thermal annealing , the primary peak at 4.42 ° , corresponding to a d - spacing of 19.99 Å , progressively intensifies and the secondary broad peak at ∼ 21.1 ° ( d = 4.21 Å ) that is probably related to π - π stacking becomes visible ( Figure 3b ) . On the basis of these XRD results , we can conclude that the oriented microstructure of the as - cast PCDSeBT thin films is kinetically limited but the polymer chains reorganize to ordered lamellar packing structures upon annealing . This observation is a plausible explanation for the sudden rise in mobility of PCDSeBT as a function of the thermal annealing .",

We can conclude that the formation of crystalline nanoscale domains would be slightly induced in PCDSeBT : PC71BM with a thermal treatment in consequence of the ordered crystalline nature of the PCDSeBT on annealing as supported by the XRD results above as well as the large quinoidal character in the polymer backbone as the inclusion of selenophene . 23 The AFM of the annealed film gives an evidence for slightly nanofibril - like organization ( see Figure 5b ) .

PFDTBT and the ter - polymer solutions exhibited two distinct absorption bands , where the first absorption peak is at around 387 nm , corresponding to the π - π * transition of the conjugated polymer backbone , 23,24 and the second absorption band in the longer wavelength region at around 530 nm , can be attributed to the strong internal charge - transfer ( ICT ) interaction between donating and accepting groups in the main chain . 21 Peak and edge positions were almost equivalent for PFDTBT , PFDTBT_5Per and PFDTBT_10Per , but the maximum absorption peak for PFDTBT_20Per moved to a shorter wavelength region . This might be due to a decrease in the internal charge - transfer ( ICT ) interaction cause by a decreased content of electron - withdrawing DTBT monomer in the copolymer . PFD2TBT and the ter - polymer solutions also exhibited two absorption bands at around 410 and 520 nm . The absorption maxima and edges of the polymer solutions showed little dependence upon perylene contents . The UV - visible absorption spectra of the synthesized polymers in a chloroform solution are shown in Figure 2 .",

Even though PFDTBT_20Per showed the highest hole mobility among the PFDTBT - based copolymers , it is UV - visible absorption spectrum showed greater blue - shifting than PFDTBT , as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , and it showed the widest band gap energy among all of the polymers considered herein . This may be why the short circuit current of the device fabricated using PFDTBT_20Per is lower than that of PFDTBT , despite it higher mobility . The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the best photovoltaic performance among the PFDTBT - based polymers ( V oc = 0.74 V , J sc = 7.19 mA / cm^2 , PCE = 2.16 % ) . For the photovoltaic devices fabricated using PFD2TBT - based polymers , the shortcircuit currents of the devices also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased ; however , the PCEs of the devices using PFD2TBT - based polymers were lower than those of PFDTBT - based polymers because of lower open - circuit voltages and short - circuit currents . The device fabricated using PFD2TBT_10Per showed the highest PCE ( 1.51 % ) among the PFD2TBT - based polymers . The characteristics of the ITO / 4 . Figure 8 shows that the J - V characteristics of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices provide a similar trend to those of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices but their PCEs increased mainly due to increased short circuit currents . The increase in the short circuit current originates from the introduction of the thin titanium suboxide ( TiO x ) layer ( ca . ∼ 10 nm ) . The titanium suboxide layer could block holes to the aluminum electrode , thus it could increase the short circuit current of the photovoltaic device . The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the highest PCE of 3.16 % with an open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , a short circuit current of 9.61 mA / cm^2 and the highest fill factor ( 0.41 ) among the fabricated devices .

Figure 9 shows the incident photon - to - current conversion efficiency ( IPCE ) spectra of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PFDTBT-10Per + PC71BM / LiF and TiO x / Al devices .

The Al electrode was removed by dipping the devices for 1 min in a mixed acid solution containing of 16 mL of concentrated phosphoric acid , 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid , 1 mL of acetic acid , and 2 mL of D 2 O. The blend films showed almost equivalently measured smooth surfaces ( according to their root - mean - square ( rms ) roughness ) with small degrees of phase separation . The rms roughness of the active layers were 0.49 nm for PFDTBT , 0.44 nm for PFDTBT-10Per , 0.51 nm for PFD2TBT , and 0.50 nm for PFD2TBT-10Per , respectively . This result suggests that the morphologies of all the active films are very similar , so that such a property will not affect the J sc of the photovoltaic devices . Therefore , the improvement of PCE and J sc in the fabricated photovoltaic devices is derived from the enhanced π - π interaction between polymers that results from the introduction of perylene units . We introduced perylene units into PFDTBT and PFD2TBT to enhance the interchain π - π interaction . The optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized copolymers showed were slight modification upon perylene addition . Interestingly , the field - effect mobility of the TFTs , using the polymers as the active layer increased with an increasing perylene content in the copolymers . The short circuit currents of the photovoltaic devices fabricated using the polymers as an electron donor , also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased , which is consistent with the field - effect mobility results of the polymers . We conclude that the introduction of perylene to the conjugated polymer chain enhances the π - π interaction between polymer chains and improves its charge - transport ability , leading to increases short circuit currents in the photovoltaic devices .

This is the first report on spirobifluorene - based conjugated polymers used for polymer solar cells , demonstrating the great potential of spirobifluorene moiety as an electron - donating unit for the construction of main chain donor - acceptor alternating conjugated polymers for high performance polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , as the most promising sustainable energy source alternative to inorganic - based solar cells , have received intensive attention in both academia and industry in recent years . 1 In comparison with inorganic solar cells , PSCs have the potential advantages of lightweight , flexibility , and manufacturing by low cost roll - to - roll process . 2 Up to date , bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure , in which the active layer consists of an interpenetrating blend of electron donating conjugated polymers and electron accepting fullerene derivatives , is still the most useful active layer structure for high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) polymer solar cells . 1,3 Intensive researches worldwide on polymer design and device fabrication have led to a rapid development in the field of PSCs . 1,4 Recently , power conversion efficiency higher than 7 % for BHJ polymer solar cells has been achieved by several groups through the developing of new polymer donor materials with the use of [ 6,6]-phenyl - C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or [ 6,6]phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as electron acceptors . 4a - i For the designing high power conversion efficiency donor polymers , the following three points should be considered : 5 ( 1 ) the polymer should have appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels for harvesting as more photons as possible from solar radiation ; 5b ( 2 ) the polymer / PCBM blend films should have high and balanced carrier mobility for generating more free charge carriers and efficiently collecting them at corresponding electrodes ; 6 ( 3 ) the polymer should be soluble in common organic solvent for solution processing . 7 Main chain donor - acceptor alternating design is a very efficient way to engineer the band gap of conjugated polymers through the internal charge transfer from donor to acceptor unit .",

In the past few years , spirobifluorene has been used as an ideal building block in construction of stable blue light - emitting materials . 11 In the spiro - annulated molecules , the two perpendicular conjugated moieties are connected with the sp 3 -hybridized carbon atom as the spiro center . This structural feature can minimize the extravagant aggregation of polymers containing spiro - annulated molecules and thus can improve their solubility and processability . 11,12 Furthermore , the spirobifluorene structure can prevent the possible photo / thermal oxidation of the 9 - position of the fluorene unit to form the undesired low energy ketonic defect . 13 In theory , stable polymer structures are beneficial for the long lifetime of polymer solar cells . Here , we demonstrate for the first time that spirobifluorene can be a very useful building block to construct main chain donor - acceptor alternating conjugated polymer , poly[2,7-(3′,6′-dioctyloxy)-9,9′-spirobifluorene - alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2 - thienyl-5′,6′-dioctyloxy-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole ) ] ( PSFDTBT ) as shown in Scheme 1 , for high efficiency polymer solar cells . The octyloxy chains on spirobifluorene and 2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole units can provide PSFDTBT with good solubility in common organic solvents . The transport properties of the polymer are investigated by fabricating organic thin film field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) .

Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) showed that PSFDTBT is of good thermal stability with less than 5 % weight loss up to 340 ° C. No clear glass transition was observed from 25 to 300 ° C in its DSC curves of the second heating and cooling runs ( 20 ° C / min ) . Optical and Electrochemical Properties . UV - vis absorption spectra of PSFDTBT in THF solution and in film are shown in Figure 1 . In THF solution , PSFDTBT exhibited a broad absorption in the range of ultraviolet to visible region with two peaks located at 395 and 527 nm , respectively . In film , the absorption of PSFDTBT became broader and slightly redshifted with two peaks located at 401 and 562 nm , respectively . In comparison with the absorption spectrum in solution , the absorption spectrum in film became broader and red - shifted for about 35 nm , indicating the aggregation or ordered packing of polymer chains in solid state . Ordered packing of polymer chains is beneficial for improving the charge mobility of resulting films . 14 The optical absorption onset of PSFDTBT film is at 629 nm , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.97 eV. PC71BM was chosen as the acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PC61BM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region with a broad peak from 440 to 530 nm , which compensates the absorption valley of the polymer . 15 As shown in Figure 1 , the PSFDTBT / PC71BM blending film ( 1 : 3 by weight ) has a strong absorption over a broad wavelength range of 400 ^ -700 nm . The electrochemical properties of PSFDTBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) . The HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT was determined to be -5.40 eV according to the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ) , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential in volts vs Ag / Ag + . 16 Since the open circuit voltage V oc of BHJ PSCs is correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , 5,17 therefore a higher V oc for PSFDTBT based polymer solar cells is anticipated due to the low - lying HOMO energy level .",

The transport properties of the polymer were investigated by fabricating organic thin film fieldeffect transistors ( OFETs ) . Typical p - channel field - effect transistor behavior was obtained . The hole mobility ( μ ) was estimated in the saturated regime from the derivative plots of the square root of source - drain current ( I SD ) versus gate voltage ( V G ) through equation 2 where W is the channel width , L is the channel length , C i is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer ( SiO 2 , 500 nm , C i = 7.5 nF / cm^2 ) , and V T is the threshold voltage .

      "text": "16 In the McCulloch group , in addition , a hole mobility of 0.24 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 and a PCE of 2.2 % were reported in a polymer containing benzo[1,2 - b:3,4 - b′:5,6 - d′]trithiophene ( BTT ) to produce effective intermolecular packing characteristics . 17,18 Quinacridone ( QC ) derivative , which is known as a red - violet pigment , has a high crystallinity and self - assembled characteristics , so it has drawn significant attention as an OTFT because of its high mobility . 19,20 However , these QC results were primarily reported for small molecules or oligomers . In the case of polymers , extremely limited results have been reported . 21,22 In the Takimiya group , recently , a polymer composed of QC derivatives has been reported for use in OTFTs that has a high hole mobility ( 0.2 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ) . 23 In this study , we synthesized a new donor - acceptor type ( D- A type ) polymer , poly[quinacridone - alt - octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole ] ( PQCDTB ) , which contained QC and octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole ( DTB ) . As a result , it is most likely that a broad absorbance could be obtained as the results of the effective charge transport and the strong electron - withdrawing caused by the high coplanarity . Table 1 shows the result of the molecular weight and the thermal properties of the obtained PQCDTB . As shown in this table , when the GPC was measured using polystyrene as the standard , the number - average molecular weights ( M n ) of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were 49.8 and 15.2 kg / mol , respectively . In contrast , the polydispersity indices ( PDIs ) showed a very narrow distribution of 1.92 and 1.77 , respectively . In terms of the degree of polymerization , PQCDTB was greater than other OPV polymers by 2 - 3 times because of the introduction of long , branched side chains of quinacridone and benzothiadiazole . As a result , the backbone structure became relatively favorable in terms of the solubility at polymerization ; polymerization had effectively occurred . 6 Table 1 showed the result of the thermal analysis through TGA . As shown in Table 1 , PQCDTB and PCZDTB had a 5 % weight loss at the temperatures of 323 and 324 ° C , respectively , displaying a high thermal stability because of the rigid QC and carbazole structure , which is applicable for optoelectronic devices and OPVs , both of which require a high thermal stability ( 300 ° C or above ) . 24 We investigated thermal behavior through DSC analysis ( see Supporting Information ) , which revealed no obvious thermal transitions for PQCDTB in the temperature range from 40 to 250 ° C. Thus , PQCDTB displayed amorphous property . Figure 1 showed X - ray diffraction measurements of film to analyze the ordering structure of the obtained polymers .",

      "text": "For the film , the maxima absorption spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were red - shifted by 9 - 23 nm compared with the solution . These results are explained by their much more planar conformations in the solid state . 10 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram of PCZDTB and PQCDTB , which were measured in 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate acetonitrile . As reported by Lidzey et al . , the PCZDTB oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potential were + 1.09 and -1.37 V , respectively , and the HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.44 and -2.98 eV. In the case of PQCDTB , unlike the PQA2 T ( poly[quinacridone - bithiophene ] ) reported by Takimiya et al . , a clear oxidation - reduction peak was observed . 19 This type of result has been obtained because PQCDTB was D - A structured , unlike the typical p - type structure of PQA2T. In PQCDTB , the oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potentials were + 0.89 and -1.36 V , respectively . The HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.24 and -2.99 eV , respectively . Table 2 summarizes the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers . As shown in Table 2 , the HOMO level of PQCDTB ( -5.24 eV ) was higher than that of PCZDTB by 0.2 eV because the HOMO level of the QC derivative was higher than that of carbazole . The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference between the HOMO energy levels and the optical bandgap energies . According to the calculations , the LUMO levels of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were -3.32 and -3.46 eV , respectively . They slightly differed from the levels calculated through CV , but they mostly exhibited a similar tendency . Figure 4 shows the band diagram of the energy levels that have been obtained through DFT calculations and experiments . The bandgap energies of PQCDTB and PCZDTB determined through UV - vis spectra were reported as 1.98 and 1.92 eV , respectively , which were lower than the results of the DFT calculation by 0.57 and 0.55 V. 28 Because the HOMO level is lower than the P3HT HOMO level ( -4.9 eV ) in both polymers , a relatively high air stability could be obtained . 29 In the case of PQCDTB , the LUMO level ( -3.32 eV ) was higher than the PC71BM LUMO level ( -4.0 eV ) by 0.68 eV. However , the HOMO level ( -5.24 eV ) was lower than the PEDOT : PSS HOMO level ( -5.0 eV ) by 0.24 eV. Therefore , if charge separation occurs after receiving light energy , a hole would exhibit more effective charge transport than an electron in the active layer of PQCDTB . 14,26 Figure 5 and Table 3 show the results of evaluating the characteristics of an OPV device .",

      "text": "The devices are structured as As shown in Figure 5a and Table 3 , the device that blended PQCDTB and PC61BM in a 1 : 1 ratio had an open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.76 V , a short - circuit current ( J SC ) of 4.4 mA cm^-2 , a fill factor ( FF ) of 47.5 % and a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 1.6 % . In the device that blended the PQCDTB and PC71BM in a 1 : 1 ratio , V OC , J SC , and FF were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , and 55.8 % , respectively . In terms of PCE , approximately 56 % was improved with 2.5 % , compared with the device in which the PC61BM was applied as an acceptor . Because PC71BM is greater than PC61BM in terms of photon absorption at 400 - 500 nm , it was able to improve the PCE by increasing J SC . 6 The V oc of PQCDTB was greater than the widely known poly(3 - hexylthiophene ) , P3HT ( V oc = 0.5 - 0.6 V ) . This type of result was obtained because PQCDTB ( -5.53 eV ) has a lower HOMO level than P3HT ( -4.9 eV ) . 19,24 The value of FF for PQCDTB ( FF = 55.8 % ) increased by 39 % compared to PCZDTB ( FF = 40.1 % ) . The series resistance at PQCDTB and PC71BM ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 , as shown in Table 3 , was 31 and 27 Ω / cm^2 , respectively . In contrast , the series resistance at PCZDTB and PC71BM ratio of 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 was 320 , 62 Ω / cm^2 , respectively . The series resistance of PQCDTB exhibited low value compared to that of PCZDTB . The decrease of series resistance could increase FF . PQCDTB showed high FF than PCZDTB due to decrease of series resistance by self - organization of quinacridone unit . 9 Figure 5b showed the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) data of the fabricated device . When PQCDTB was used as a donor and PC61BM and PC71BM were used as acceptors , the device had 38 % and 41 % EQE at 480 nm , respectively . The photovoltaic devices with PC71BM as an acceptor showed higher EQE values than those with PC61BM as an acceptor , although they absorbed photons in the same range of the solar spectra . This was because PC71BM has a stronger UV - vis absorption property than does PC61BM in the visible region , especially near 500 nm . 30 Hence , the PCE improved with an increase in J SC . In a device that used PCZDTB as a donor , an EQE of 48 % was observed at 440 nm . Interestingly , λ max was blue - shifted by -30 nm because of the low π - π stacking and the weak intermolecular interaction of PCZDTB compared with PQCDTB .",

      "text": "To investigate the morphology of the polymer / PCBM blend film , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was performed , and the result is shown in Figure 6 . In Figure 6a , microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM , while the polymer formed a small fibril - type domain at a 1 : 1 PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio . As shown in Figure 6c , the fibril domain or microphase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size . It appears that this type of fibril domain occurred because PQCDTB formed effective π - π stacking based on outstanding crystallinity . 31 As shown in Figure 6b , in contrast , when the PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio was 1 : 2 , the polymers were assembled , and a large domain was formed . As a result , a relatively large - size phase separation took place . As shown in Figure 6d , the large domain or the large - size phase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size . The large - phase separation exhibits a low photocurrent by reducing the charge separation and increasing the exciton diffusion length and the recombination of electric charges . 32 Therefore , at a 1 : 2 polymer / PC71BM ratio , a large phase separation occurs between the polymer and the PC71BM . As a result , a low photocurrent would occur ; this is comparable to the 1 : 1 ratio . The same results were confirmed for the current device using the data in Table 3 . Similar results were observed between PQCDTB and PC61BM as well . When the PCZDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 4 , a smooth morphology was detected , and no fibril domain was observed , just like the PQCDTB , because the self - organization of PCZDTB is lower than that of PQCDTB . 9 In this study , PQCDTB has been successfully synthesized through the Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing planar quinacridone unit and a broad - absorption benzothiadiazole unit . PQCDTB had a high molecular weight and good thermal stability . Because of the appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels , an effective balance was produced . According to the X - ray diffraction measurement , a broad diffraction peak was observed at approximately 24.0 ° . In terms of the π - π stacking distance ( d π ) , a significantly shorter distance ( 3.7 Å ) was observed . These values were similar to the results of the thiophene and thiophenefused aromatic system polymers . When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the highest efficiency was detected , and V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8 % , and 2.5 % , respectively . When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the polymer formed a fibril - type domain and microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM . Because of selforganization , PQCDTB showed a higher FF compared with PCZDTB .",

      "text": "Significant progress has been made in synthesis of conjugated polymers and their applications for optoelectronic device such as organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , organic photovoltaic cells ( OPVs ) , and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) since Heeger , MacDiarmid , and Shirakawa discovered conducting polymers in 1976.^1 As a result of the low - cost , light - weight , and flexibility advantages , optoelectronic devices based on conjugated polymers are a promising cost - effective alternative to inorganic materials - based microelectronics . Conjugated polymers can be classified as hole ( p - type ) or electron ( n - type ) transporting materials according to the type of orderly transferring charge carriers . Most of conjugated polymers are p - type semiconductors that have seen a dramatic rise in performance over the past decade while much less attention has been devoted to n - type semiconducting polymers that have lagged behind their p - type counterparts . 2 Organic n - type materials are essential for the fabrication of organic p - n junctions , OPVs , n - channel OFETs , OLEDs , and complementary logic circuits . 3 The n - type building blocks are the core components in n - type semiconducting polymers . Aromatic imides such as rylene diimides are one of the classical n - type building blocks and can exhibit relatively high electron affinities , high electron mobilities , and excellent chemical , thermal , and photochemical stabilities . 4 These materials are electron deficient due to the substitution of an aromatic core with one or two sets of π - accepting imide groups that are mutually conjugated . The widely used rylene diimides include perylene diimides ( PDIs , 1 ) and naphthalene diimides ( NDIs , 2 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Zhan and co - workers reported the synthesis of the first soluble rylene - based fully conjugated polymer . 5 Top - gate OFETs based on this PDI- dithienothiophene copolymer exhibited a saturation electron mobility ( μ e ) of 6 x 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , current on / off ratio ( I on / I off ) of 10 ^ 4 , and a low threshold voltage ( V th ) of 7 V in air . 6 Moreover , all - polymer solar cells based on blends of polythiophene derivative donors and PDI - dithienothiophene copolymer acceptors exhibited power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as high as 1.5 % ( AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 ) . 7 - 9 Facchetti et al . reported a conjugated copolymer of NDI and bithiophene ; 10 OFET devices based on this polymer fabricated in a top - gate , bottom - contact configuration with polymeric dielectrics exhibited μ e of 0.1 - 0.85 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 under ambient conditions with I on / I off > 10 ^ 5 . 11 The simplest aromatic imide system is phthalimide ( 3 ) and thiophene imide ( 4 ) ( Figure 1 ) . A few literatures reported phthalimide - containing conjugated polymers such as poly-(phenylene ethynylene)s , 12 a polyaniline derivative , 13 and a polythiophene derivative .",

It could promote intrachain and interchain interactions along and between coplanar polymer chains . Zhang et al . pioneered to use thiophene imide as a building block in conjugated polymers . 15,16 Later , thiophene imide homopolymers were synthesized . 17 - 19 Recently , polymer solar cells based on blends of copolymers of thiophene imide and benzodithiophene 20 - 23 or cyclopentadithiophene 24 with soluble fullerene derivatives PC71BM or PC61BM exhibited PCEs of 3 - 6.8 % . Wudl et al . reported low - bandgap conjugated polymers based on thiophene - fused phthalimide , i.e. , isothianaphthene imides ( 5 , Figure 1 ) . 25,26 2,2 0 -Bithiophene-3,3 0 -dicarboximide ( BTI , 6 , Figure 1 ) with π - core planarity , antiparallel BTI packing , a short cofacial π - π distance of 3.43 Å , and a favorable solubilizing group orientation is a promising building block in n - type polymers . 27 Facchetti et al . reported that n - channel OFET based on a bithiophene imide homopolymer exhibited a μ e of 1.1 x 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , I on / I off of 2 x 10 ^ 7 , and a high V th ( 75 V ) in vacuum after annealing process at 240 ° C. 27 The fused - ring system can maximize the π - orbital overlap by restricting intramolecular rotation in the oligomer and possibly to induce face - to - face π - stacking , facilitating charge transport through intermolecular hopping . On the other hand , the fused rings can make the polymer backbone more rigid and coplanar , therefore enhancing effective π - conjugation , lowering bandgap , and extending absorption . 28 - 31 Therefore , fused - ring building blocks are widely used in synthesis of conjugated polymers . 32 - 34 For example , the large planar benzodithiophene ( BDT ) unit has emerged as an attractive building block for conjugated polymers . 35 Benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene ( 7 , Figure 2 ) with a curved structure prevents a fully conjugated pathway between substituents at the 2 - and 6 - positions . Hence , delocalization of the conjugated π - electron system along the copolymer backbone is disfavored by the incorporation of this unit . This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation . Additionally , compared to a single thiophene ring , it must be pointed out that due to the large resonance stabilization energy of BDT , the delocalization of electrons from the BDT unit into the backbone is less favorable than from the thiophene ring . As a result , a more stable copolymer with high performance can be obtained by using BDT as the core unit . OFETs based on a benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene copolymer manufactured on flexible substrate exhibited high hole mobility of 0.5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 when the source - gate voltage is increased to 60 V.",

The combination of benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene planarity and efficient π - π stacking with the electron - withdrawing capacity of the imide functionality serves as the foundation for this new class of materials . Introduction of the π - electron - deficient imide moiety can decrease the HOMO and LUMO energies of the polymers , which is necessary for air - stable polymers . Furthermore , substitution at the imide nitrogen allows introduction of functionalities and solubility improvement with varying degrees of steric bulk while not impinging on critical intermolecular π - π stacking characteristics . This motif also leaves the benzo[2,1 - b:3,4 - b 0 ] dithiophene 2 - and 7 - positions available for polymerization . Finally , the dipole moment caused by the imide could stabilize cofacial antiparallel intra - and interchain repeat unit orientations , planarize the backbone , and promote π - π stacking . 27 On the basis of this new building block , we designed and synthesized a series of conjugated copolymers : unit 8 coupled with electron - rich unit benzo[1,2b:4,5 - b 0 ] dithiophene ( P1 and P2 ) or with electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole ( P3 and P4 ) or benzo [ c ] [ 1,2,5]thiadiazole ( P5 ) and homopolymer ( P6 ) ( Figure 2 ) . The optical properties and electronic structure ( HOMO / LUMO levels and bandgap ) can be manipulated through adjusting copolymerized building blocks . ' RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization . The synthetic routes to the monomers and polymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2 . We chose very cheap , industrial product maleic anhydride as a starting material . Bromination of maleic anhydride with Br 2 gave its dibromide ( 1 ) . 41 Then , amination with alkylamine afforded the alkyl - substituted 3,4dibromopyrrole-2,5 - dione ( 2a , b ) . Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide 2a , b with 3 - thienylboronic acid gave 3,4 - bis(3 - thienyl)pyrrole-2,5 - dione ( 3a , b ) . The large sulfur - containing polycyclic aromatic imides , dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 4a , b ) , were synthesized through iron(III ) chloride - mediated oxidative cyclization , which is a general strategy for ring closure . 42 Bromination of 4a , b with Br 2 gave rise to the monomers 5a , b. Stille coupling reaction of 5a with tributyl(thiophen-2 - yl)stannane afforded 2,7 - bis(2 - thienyl)-dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 6a ) , which was brominated with NBS to afford monomer 7a . Copolymers P1 - P4 were synthesized through Stille coupling reaction of the dibromide monomers 5a , b or 7a with benzodithiophene-2,6 - ditin or 2,2 0 -bithiazole-5,5 0 -ditin , while P5 was synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide monomer 5b with benzothiadiazole-4,7 - diboronic ester . Homopolymer P6 was synthesized by palladium - catalyzed homocoupling of the dibromide 5b in the presence of hexabutylditin . P1 with three solubilizing n - dodecyl groups has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , THF , and toluene .",

The redox behavior for P1 - P6 and small molecule 4b were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( Figure 6 ) . The monomer 4b shows a reversible reduction wave and an irreversible oxidation wave . The HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials , assuming the absolute energy level of ferrocene / ferrocenium to be 4.8 eV below vacuum , and the data are summarized in Table 2 . The LUMO of 4b is -3.12 eV , which is similar to that ( ca . -3.23 eV ) of n - type building block BTI ( 6 , Figure 1 ) . 27 As it is generally assumed that a high electron affinity ( > 3 eV ) is necessary for n - type materials , 4,45,46 we suggest that dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide functions as a n - type building block . However , compared to the very strong n - type building blocks PDI ( 1 , Figure 1 ) and NDI ( 2 , Figure 1 ) the imide moiety indeed significantly lowers the HOMO / LUMO .

The LUMO of P1 is higher than that of poly[thiopheneimide - alt - benzo[1,2 - b:4,5 - b 0 ] dithiophene ] ( -3.6 eV ) , 20 indicating that the electron - withdrawing ability of dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide is weaker than that of thiophene imide ( 4 , Figure 1 ) . As a result of two more electrondonating thiophenes in the polymer backbone , the HOMO of P2 increases by 0.22 eV relative to that of P1 . P3 and P4 with weak electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole exhibit similar HOMO / LUMO levels to homopolymer P6 , while the stronger electronaccepting unit benzo [ c][1,2,5]thiadiazole reduced the LUMO by 0.28 eV. The HOMO - LUMO gaps E g cv , estimated from electrochemistry , are larger than the optical bandgaps E g opt , very similar to that for BTI homopolymer and copolymer . 27 Photovoltaic Cells . To demonstrate potential application of dithieno[3,2 - f : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -h]phthalimide - based polymers in organic photovoltaics ( OPV ) , we chose P1 as an example to fabricate polymer solar cell devices because it possesses relatively broad absorption , proper HOMO / LUMO energy levels , and good solubility .",

The optical properties of these random terpolymers can be easily controlled by tuning the ratio between DPP and TPD ; an increase in TPD induced increased absorption between 400 and 650 nm and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level , while higher DPP contents resulted in stronger absorption between 600 and 900 nm . The best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.33 % was obtained from PBDTT - DPP75 - TPD25 with [ 6,6]-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) due to the improved light absorption and thus a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) higher than 16 mA / cm^2 . Interestingly , the trend observed in the PCE values differed from that of optical behavior of the PBDTT - DPP - TPD in terms of the DPP to TPD ratio , showing nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % . Density functional theory calculations showed that the small portions of strong electron - withdrawing DPP in PBDTT - DPP25 - TPD75 and PBDTT - DPP10 - TPD90 could provide trap sites , which suppress efficient charge transfer . In contrast , for PBDTT - DPP90 - TPD10 and PBDTT - DPP75 - TPD25 , the effect of minor portions of TPD on electron density distribution was found to be minimal . In addition , the polymer packing and nanomorphology were investigated by grazing - incidence X - ray scattering and atomic force microscopy . The findings suggested that controlling the ratio of electron - deficient units in the random terpolymers is critical for optimizing their performance in polymer solar cells because it affects the polymer packing structure , the optical and electrical properties , and the electron distribution in the polymers . Low - band - gap polymers for bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ)-type polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have been studied intensively with the aim of matching a greater part of the solar spectrum and thus harvesting more photon flux , to produce efficiencies greater than 7 - 9 % . 1 - 9 In most cases , low - band - gap polymers achieved by the donor - acceptor ( D - A ) approach do not show broad absorption , but instead the absorption maxima are redshifted , decreasing the number of absorbed photons in the visible region and ultimately limiting the achievable photocurrent . 10 - 13 One promising approach toward broadening the absorption of the solar spectrum is to develop random terpolymers based on the copolymerization of two different electron - rich units and one electron - deficient unit 14 - 16 or one electron - rich unit and two different electron - deficient units . 17 - 22 The judicious selection of two different electrondeficient or - rich groups with different electron - withdrawing or - donating strengths is critical to achieve complementary and broad visible light absorption , thus maximizing photon harvesting .

In contrast , the PCE suddenly decreased in the blended device of P5 and PC61BM ( 3.02 % ) and further decreased in P6 ( 2.09 % ) , mainly due to the significant decrease of the J SC . The low J SC values of P5 and P6 were unexpected , considering the lower band gaps of P5 ( 1.49 eV ) and P6 ( 1.55 eV ) compared to that of P7 ( 1.85 eV ) . To better understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC values , the space - chargelimited current ( SCLC ) of hole - only devices of the P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 blended devices were measured and compared ( Figure S5 ) . The hole - only devices were constructed under optimized device conditions with the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / blends / Au . The hole mobilities of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 were 1.14 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.13 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.09 × 10 ^ -4 , 1.10 × 10 ^ -4 , and 1.18 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively , showing that the hole mobilities of all random terpolymers were similar to or 1 order of magnitude higher than their parent polymers .

The optimized molecular geometries of the models and their calculated HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals are depicted in Figure 5 and Figure S7 .

In contrast , for ( BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD ) , the electron density distribution in the HOMO wave function is different from those of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 5c , d ) . Therefore , the small portions of DPP could hinder the preseparation of an exciton into a loosely Coulombically bound exciton , which suppresses electron transfer from donor ( polymer ) to acceptor ( PCBM ) . 48 - 50 Therefore , one possible explanation of the lower PCEs in P5 and P6 is that the DPP acts as a trapping site , resulting in poor intramolecular charge transfer . In contrast , as evidenced in the results of the DFT calculations for ( BDTT - DPP)-(BDTT - TPD)-(BDTT - DPP ) , the electron distribution in the HOMO and LUMO wave functions is similar to those of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 ( Figures 5a , b ) . Such a trapping effect is expected to be trivial in P2 and P3 random terpolymers with a higher DPP to TPD ratio . Therefore , the incorporation of different electron - deficient units could significantly influence the intramolecular charge transfer , suggesting that the optimum composition is required to tune the intra - and intermolecular charge transfer and their performance of PSCs .

As more TPD was introduced into the polymer backbone , the domain spacing of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 gradually increased from 19.2 , 20.1 , 21.9 , 22.7 to 24.1 Å , respectively . This is likely due to the increased amount of structurally longer alkyl side chains of TPD . Figure S8 shows that the pristine polymers exhibited a distinctive arc scattering of the ( 010 ) peak along the out - of - plane direction at q = 1.62- 1.68 Å -1 , corresponding to π - π stacking . The π - π stacking is more prominent in the out - of - plane direction , which suggests that most of the polymer backbones are oriented parallel to the substrates . The π - π stacking distances of polymers were 3.85 , 3.86 , 3.84 , 3.85 , and 3.74 Å for P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 , respectively . The combination effects of the DPP to TPD ratio with changes in the alkyl chain could affect the π - π stacking distance of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 and backbone planarity , thus influencing their charge transport properties . The π - π stacking feature of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 in the blended films was significantly changed by the addition of PCBM , as shown in Figure 6 . No π - π stacking diffraction was observed in P1 , P3 , and P4 , and only a faint π - π stacking diffraction pattern in the out - of - plane direction appeared for P5 . However , P7 had a prominent π - π stacking peak even after the addition of PCBM , indicating that the polymer backbone adopts a preferential \" face - on \" orientation relative to the substrate . In spite of the \" face - on \" orientation of P7 , its mobility was observed to be slightly lower compared to the other polymers , which is most likely due to the presence of fewer percolating pathways for hole transport . 54 Therefore , the GIXS patterns revealed that the incorporation of the different units of DPP and TPD affects the polymeric ordering ( i.e. , domain spacing ) as well as its direction . For further characterization , the BHJ morphology of the polymer blends was investigated by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . The resulting AFM and TEM images are shown in Figure 7 and Figure S9 , respectively .

It was also reported that angular - fused NDT has a lower - lying HOMO energy level than that of linearfused NDT , which could be beneficial for better air stability and greater open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) for polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) . 9c Very recently , our group reported a broad bandgap D - A copolymer PzNDTTPD based on 4,9 - bis(2 - ethylhexyloxy)-naphtho [ 1,2 - b:5,6 - b′]dithiophene and thieno [ 3,4 - c]pyrrole-4,6dione ( TPD ) . 14 The polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) with PzNDTTPD as donor and [ 6,6]-phenyl - C71 - butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor demonstrated a PCE of 5.26 % with a high V oc of 0.91 V compared to the linear NDT - TPD - based copolymer PNDTTPD with a PCE of 4.0 % and a V oc of 0.69 V. 15 Meanwhile , high - performance p - channel fieldeffect transistors with hole mobility of 0.067 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and an on / off current ratio of 10 ^ 9 -10 ^ 10 were obtained .

On the basis of the above consideration , herein , we designed and synthesized two new D - A copolymers PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO ( Scheme 1 ) based on zNDT flanked with two thiophene units as donor unit and BT or BO as acceptor unit . We introduced two dodecyloxy substituents on BT / BO rings to guarantee good solubility of the polymers . The thermal , photophysical , and optoelectronic properties of the resulting two polymers were systematically investigated . The results showed that both the two polymers exhibit not only high fieldeffect mobilities but also high photovoltaic properties . Synthesis and Thermal Stability . The synthetic routes of monomers and corresponding polymers are outlined in Scheme 1 . Monomer 1 was reacted with n - butyllithium and then with Me 3 SnCl to give compound M 1 in a good yield . Both polymers were synthesized by palladium - catalyzed Stille - coupling polymerization and purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction with methanol , hexanes , and CHCl 3 . The CHCl 3 fraction was then reduced in volume , precipitated into methanol , and collected by filtration , yielding shiny , bronze - colored solids . PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO can be readily dissolved in common solvents , such as chloroform , toluene , and chlorobenzene , and processed to form smooth and pinhole - free films upon spincoating . The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by GPC in THF solution relative to polystyrene standards , and the detailed GPC data are listed in Table 1 .. Both polymers have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures with 5 % weight loss at 313 - 320 ° C . Obviously , the thermal stability of these polymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs , OFETs , and other optoelectronic devices . Optical Properties . , including the absorption peak wavelengths ( λ abs ) , the absorption edge wavelengths ( λ onset ) , and the optical band gap ( E g opt ) . In Figure 3a , both of the absorption spectra recorded from dilute chloroform solutions display π - π * transitions at around 425 nm and large charge transfer features between 500 and 700 nm which are assigned by analogy to similar polymers , corresponding to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the acceptor ( BT / BO ) and donor ( NDT ) units .",

The stronger ICT within PzNDTDTBO is originated from a relatively stronger electron - withdrawing nature of BO unit compared to that of the BT one . In films , the absorption spectra of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are similar to those in solution , with obvious red - shifts ( 56 - 68 nm ) of their absorption maxima as shown in Figure 3b , which is a common phenomenon for conjugated polymers , owing to the aggregation of the conjugated polymer main chains in the solid films . In addition , both PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO display prominent vibronic shoulders at shorter wavelengths , implying an ordered arrangement in their solid films , with strong π - π stacking between the polymeric backbonesa feature that also appears in the spectra of regioregular poly(3 - hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT ) , which is beneficial to improve the charge mobility of resulting films . 21 The absorption edges for solid films of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are 703 and 704 nm , respectively , corresponding to nearly the same optical band gap ( E g opt ) of 1.76 eV. Compared with the reported copolymer PzNDTTPD , 14 both PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO show broader absorption spectra and smaller bandgaps , which can be attributed to the stronger electron - accepting ability of the BT / BO unit in the copolymer , and this is beneficial to increase the light - harvesting capacity for higher short - circuit current density ( J sc ) . 2d Electrochemical Properties . Cyclic voltammetry has been employed and considered as an effective tool in investigating electrochemical properties of conjugated organic molecules and polymers . 22 From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammogram , energy levels of HOMO and LUMO can be readily estimated , which correspond to ionization potential ( IP ) and electron affinity ( EA ) , respectively .

Since the open - circuit voltage V oc of bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs is positively correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , a higher V oc for PzNDTDTBObased polymer solar cells could be anticipated due to the lowerlying HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO . 24 Photovoltaic Properties . To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the NDT - based semiconductor , PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated . Figure 5 shows the current density - voltage characteristic of PSCs based on the blends of polymer : PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5 G , 100 mW cm^-2 . To further study the performance of the PSC devices , the hole mobilities in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method using devices with structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au at the optimized blend ratio of polymer / PC71BM . For unipolar transport in a trap - free semiconductor with an ohmic injecting contact , the SCLC can be approximated by the Mott - Gurney equation : ε ε μ γ ≅ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ J V L V L 9 ^ 8 exp 0.891 r 0 ^ 0 2 ^ 3 ( 3 ) Here J is the current density , ε r is the dielectric constant of the polymer , ε 0 is the free - space permittivity ( 8.85 × 10 ^ -12 F / m ) , μ 0 is the charge mobility at zero field , γ is a constant , L is the thickness of the blended film layer , V = V appl - V bi , V appl is the applied potential , and V bi is the built - in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode ( in this device structure , V bi = 0.2 V ) .

The blends of PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO with PC71BM at different weight ratios were used to optimize the device performances , and their J - V curves are shown in Figure 5 . The PSCs based on PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than that based on PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM . With a weight ratio of PzNDTDTBO to PC71BM 1.5 : 1 , a PCE of 4.37 % with V oc of 0.76 V , J sc of 10.35 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 55.5 % was achieved while the devices based on PzNDTDTBT showed a relatively low PCE of 2.43 % , with V oc of 0.62 V , J sc of 8.21 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 47.7 % at the optimal PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ratio of 1 : 2 ( w / w ) . The increased value of V oc of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs is in accordance with the decreased value of the HOMO energy level of the polymer and the higher J sc and FF could be attributed to the higher hole mobility ( 4.4 × 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) . By addition of 1 % 1,8 - diiodooctane ( DIO ) into o - DCB used for spin - coating , the PCEs of the solar cells based on PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO were improved to 3.22 and 4.63 % , respectively , mostly through an increase in the FF . 25 To further improve the photovoltaic performances of the PSC devices , thermal annealing was employed . , the FF of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs increased from 62.5 to 65.5 % , and consequently , the PCE increased from 4.63 to 5.07 % . However , for PzNDTDTBT , the measured PCE was not improved by thermal annealing but , inversely , exhibited a slight decrease of photovoltaic values .

After adding DIO , a nanoscaled fine interpenetrating network and smaller domain size of phase separation are formed , which is beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport . R a is raised from 0.27 to 1.91 nm for PzNDTDTBT and from 1.23 to 1.88 nm for PzNDTDTBO , which can explain the increase of FF of the photovoltaic devices to some degree .

Similarly , for PzNDTDTBO , after annealing at 220 ° C , weak diffraction peaks at 4.3 ° and 8.5 ° appeared , and the peak at 32.9 ° , corresponding to a π - π stacking distance of 2.7 Å , became stronger and sharper . These XRD studies clearly manifest the enhancement of molecular ordering within thin films of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO after annealing , which are in agreement with the observation that hole mobilities of devices increase with annealing . In addition , the high crystallinity of the PzNDTDTBO film can also explain the high hole mobility of the PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM blend film measured by SCLC method mentioned above . AFM images were performed on polymer thin films on OTSmodified SiO 2 / Si substrates as shown in Figure 12 . The highly uniform intertwined polymer fibers are observed for both of the two polymers . With film annealing treatments , the films form larger crystal grains and better film interconnectivity , which are favorable for the charge transport and lead to an increase of the mobility .

The energy levels , absorption spectra and band gaps of the resulting polymers were well tuned by utilizing different thiophene derivatives as spacer between IDT and NT units , and polymer PIDT - C12NT which employed bithiophene attached with dodecyl side chain as spacer exhibited superior properties compared to the other two copolymers . All polymers exhibited deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and subsequently lead to high open circuit voltages of fabricated solar cell devices . Best performance of the bulk - heterojunction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 5.05 % was achieved with PIDT - C12NT as donor and ( 6,6)-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor , which can be attributed to its higher charge carrier mobility , the optimized interpenetrating network as well as enhanced absorption coefficient of photoactive layer with respect to the other two polymers . The results demonstrated that the combination of IDT and NT with appropriate spacers was a promising molecular design strategy for the application of solar cells . During the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted extensive attention due to their lightweight , low cost and great potential for the fabrication of large - area flexible devices . 1 - 3 PSCs based on bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) architecture are of particular interests since high performance devices with power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) exceed 8 % can be achieved . 4 - 9 Typical BHJ devices comprise a phaseseparated donor / acceptor blend layer with low band gap conjugated polymers as the electron donor , and fullerene derivatives such as [ 6,6]-phenyl - C61 - butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or [ 6,6]-phenyl - C71 - butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as the electron acceptor . 10,11 Generally , when considering that open circuit voltage ( V oc ) is related to the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level of donor materials and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of acceptor , 12,13 deep HOMO levels for low band gap conjugated polymers are preferred in order to attain high V oc . However , lowering HOMO level would result in larger band gap , and thereby the absorption of resulted polymers would have less overlap with solar spectrum , which are unfavorable for high short circuit current ( J sc ) . To obtain the ideal low band gap polymer with appropriate energy levels that can make a tradeoff between open circuit voltage ( V oc ) and band gap so as to maximize the PCE , an intriguing approach involves incorporat - ing electron rich moieties ( donor , D ) and electron deficient moieties ( acceptor , A ) and alternating them on the backbone , which are so - called D - A type low band gap conjugated polymers .",

Therefore , the spacers consist of thiophene or bithiophene functionalized with various alkyl side chains were introduced in between IDT and NT units to improve the solubility of the resulting polymers , which may also potentially lead to improved molecular weight that is favorable for the optimal morphology and charge carrier transport . 39 - 41 We notice that the incorporated side chains may also increase the dihedral angle of their contiguous aromatic units , 42,43 which may somewhat inhibit polymer backbone planarity and thereby increase band gap and lower the charge carrier mobility . 40,41 However , it should be tried several different alkyl side chains to achieve a delicate balance of the molecular weight , solubility as well as planarity of polymers as no comprehensive rule has yet emerged of the influences of specific side chains . 44,45 It was realized that by switching the spacer between the IDT and NT units , the processability , backbone planarity , charge carrier mobility and film morphology can be optimized . Further investigation of photovoltaic performances indicates all devices present high V oc because of the relatively deep HOMO energy levels of these polymers , and the highest PCE of 5.05 % was achieved based on PIDT - C12NT . Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ; see Figure 1 ) were used to probe thermal properties .

Slightly improved device performance was realized based on PIDT - DTNT , which exhibited a V oc of 0.80 V , a FF of 45 % , but a dramatically improved J sc of 8.26 mA cm^-2 , leading to a moderate PCE of 2.97 % .

The energy levels of the copolymers are lower than those of other heteroarene - based DPP copolymers reported previously , [ 21][22][23][24][25][26 ] and their low - lying HOMO energy levels are expected to afford high V OC s of the polymer solar cells . The crystal properties of the copolymers were investigated by X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) . The two copolymers clearly showed a characteristic diffraction peak in the range of 3 - 5 ° with a weak diffraction peak in the range of 15 - 20 ° which are associated with ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) diffraction , respectively ( Fig . 2a ) , indicating that both copolymers form a crystalline lamellar structure in the thin film state . It should be noted here that these copolymers exhibit distinct X - ray diffraction without any thermal treatment . Both copolymers exhibit a sharp and intense ( 100 ) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.2 ° corresponding to the interchain distance ( d 100 ) of 21.0 Å , while the ( 010 ) diffraction peak was observed at 19.4 ° for PTATDPP and 19.1 ° for PTAFDPP , corresponding to the π - π stacking distance ( d 010 ) of 4.6 Å and 4.7 Å , respectively . For identifying the reason for high crystallinity of the copolymers , the density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation for the minimum energy conformations of the copolymers was performed to reveal the difference of the dihedral angle between the TA and DPP units in the copolymers . To simplify the calculation , one repeating unit of each polymer was used as the model compound , and long alkyl substituents were replaced by the ethyl group . As shown in Fig . 2b , TA and TDPP have a coplanar structure with a dihedral angle smaller than 1 ° while TA and FDPP have a slightly distorted structure with a dihedral angle of 3.8 ° . This difference of the dihedral angle between PTATDPP and PTAFDPP accounts for the difference of d 010 , and thus , PTATDPP is expected to form a more closely - packed lamellar structure than PTAFDPP . To investigate the charge transporting characteristics of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP , bottom - gate and top - contact fieldeffect transistors ( FETs ) were fabricated . Both copolymers clearly exhibit current modulation and saturation with unipolar p - type field - effect charge transporting behavior , as shown in Fig . 3 . The calculated saturation hole mobilities ( μ h ) for PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are 2.7 × 10 ^ -2 and 8.9 × 10 ^ -3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , with high on / off ratios ( > 10 ^ 5 ) and low threshold voltages ( < 20 V ) .",

      "text": "The decent hole mobilities of both copolymers can be attributed to high crystallinity of the copolymers due to the highly coplanar structure of anthracene and DPP . It is also understood that the 3 - fold higher chargecarrier mobility of PTATDPP than that of PTAFDPP arises from its stronger π - π stacking with a shorter d 010 , as discussed above . When the photovoltaic properties of copolymers are measured using PC71BM as an electron acceptor , it is found that the optimum blend ratio of polymer : PC71BM is 1 : 2 to afford the best PCE of both copolymers with the conventional device architecture of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al ( Fig . S2 and Table S1 † ) . The best PCE was also achieved when o - dichlorobenzene was used as a solvent and the optimum thickness for the active layer was ca . 90 nm . The current density - voltage ( J - V ) characteristics of the optimized solar cells are shown in Fig . 4 , and the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Tables 2 and S2 . † PTATDPP showed a best PCE of 6.69 % ( V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 12.3 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.68 ) , while PTAFDPP showed a best PCE of 5.02 % ( V OC = 0.76 V , J SC = 11.2 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.59 ) . Both copolymers showed higher V OC s than other DPP - based copolymers due to their low - lying HOMO energy levels . Both copolymers also exhibited high J SC s and FFs , indicating their decent ability for charge generation and transport . Therefore , the TA unit is a promising electron - donating unit for low band - gap copolymers with a low - lying HOMO energy level . When the PSC devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture ( ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag ) in order to further improve the photovoltaic performance , the PCEs of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP - based devices were improved to 7.02 % and 5.22 % , respectively ( Fig . 4b , Tables 2 and S2 † ) , mainly due to enhanced J SC s ( V OC s and FFs were not changed significantly ) . It is noteworthy here that the PCE of over 7 % of PTATDPP is the highest efficiency of anthracene - based low band - gap conjugated copolymers . In spite of the same band - gap of the two copolymers , PTATDPP shows slightly higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP ( Fig . S3 † ) . This can be ascribed to the closely packed microstructures of PTATDPP and thereby its high charge - carrier mobility than PTAFDPP . When the crystal structures of blend films of the copolymers with PC71BM were examined by XRD , the PTATDPP / PC71BM blend had strong and intense ( 100 ) diffraction while the PTAFDPP / PC71BM blend showed weak and broad ( 100 ) diffraction ( Fig . 2b ) .",

      "text": "This result leads us to conclude that PTATDPP retains a higher crystalline nature in the blend with PC71BM , affording a better hole transporting pathway and thus exhibiting a higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP . When the morphologies of active layers were observed by transmission electron microscopy , the PTATDPP : PC71BM blend shows clearly a fibril nanostructure ( fibril width ∼ 30 nm ) with the formation of a bi - continuous network , whereas the PTAFDPP : PC71BM blend shows a phase - separated morphology without the formation of distinct nanostructures , as shown in Fig . 5 . It is well recognized that the nanoscale phase separation with a fibril structure is favourable for an efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport which are the prerequisites for high J SC and FF of PSCs . Therefore , the high FF ( 0.68 ) of PTATDPP - based device arises mainly from the efficient charge - carrier mobility and the formation of a nanoscale fibril structure of PTATDPP . To further evaluate the potential of PTATDPP as an electron donor material for PSCs , we fabricated a non - fullerene PSC device by blending PTATDPP with a non - fullerene small molecular electron acceptor , 2,2′9,9′-tetra(undecan-6 - yl)- [ 5,5′bianthra ( 2,1,9 - def:6,5,10 - d′e′f′)diisoquinolin]-1,1′,3,3′,8,8′,10,10′- ( 2H,2′H,9H,9′H)-octaone ( di - PBI ) . 38 As can be seen in Fig . 6a , PTATDPP and di - PBI have well - matched energy levels with a LUMO - LUMO offset of 0.4 eV , 39 which is enough for exciton dissociation , and also exhibit complementary absorption , i.e. , di - PDI and PTATDPP absorb 400 - 600 nm and 600 - 800 nm , respectively . As a consequence , the blend film ( 1 : 2 in weight ratio ) exhibits a broad light absorption from 400 to 800 nm . The compatibility of PTATDPP and di - PBI as an electron donor and an acceptor , respectively , was also examined by monitoring the photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching of each compound in the blend film . As shown in Fig . 6c , the blend film shows excellent PL quenching over 95 % of each PL from PTATDPP and di - PBI , indicating that photogenerated excitons from both PTATDPP and di - PBI are readily dissociated into free carriers at the interface of two materials . The non - fullerene PSC fabricated from the blend of PTATDPP and di - PBI exhibits a PCE of 4.23 % with V OC = 0.77 V , J SC = 9.8 mA cm^-2 and FF = 0.56 ( Fig . 7 ) . Interestingly , the blend morphology of PTATDPP and di - PDI as observed from atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and TEM reveals that PTATDPP forms a well - developed interconnected BHJ morphology with a fibrillar nanostructure ( Fig . S4 and S5 † ) . This fibril morphology affords the effective exciton dissociation as observed from the PL quenching experiment .",

We have designed and synthesized two anthracene - based low band - gap copolymers , PTATDPP and PTAFDPP . Since the TA unit has a highly conjugated 2 - D structure with a weak electron - donating nature , the copolymer composed of TA and DPP units shows a relatively low band - gap , a low - lying HOMO energy level , high crystallinity , and efficient charge transporting characteristics .

Using PBDT - TDPP - S as electron donor and [ 6,6]-phenyl - C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as electron acceptor , the resulting polymer solar cells exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a power conversion efficiency of 4.89 % , an open - circuit voltage of 0.84 V , a short - circuit current of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor of 56.0 % .

Nowadays , most of the present polymers are in main - chain D - A frame , which may suffer from lower hole mobility due to the influence of acceptor units in the main chain . Aiming at investigating the effects of the D - A framework on device performance , Huang and co - workers proposed a new molecular design strategy toward side - chain D - A conjugated polymers , in which D moieties were employed to construct the main chain and A units were conjugatedly pended onto the D units in the side chain . 4 Compared to the corresponding main - chain D - A polymers , the side - chain ones mainly possesses three advantages . First , the highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) energy levels of the side - chain polymers can preserve in a deeper position . Second , a two - dimensional - like structural feature renders this class of polymers with better solubility . Finally , there exists an internal charge transfer ( ICT ) behavior from the side - chain D - A structure , which can fine - tune the band gap ( E g ) of the resultant polymers as well as promote an isotropic charge transport along the polymeric main chain . As a result of these merits , PSCs based on these previously reported side - chain D - A polymers exhibited a maximal PCE of 4.74 % .",

The first one at ∼ 420 nm corresponds to the π - π * transition of the polymeric backbone in short wavelength region . The second one at ∼ 590 nm in long wavelength region is attributed to the ICT interaction between the donor unit in the main chain and the acceptor unit at the side chain . Compared with the absorption spectrum in DCM solution , the one in solid film displayed a red - shift absorption peak at 602 nm and an additional shoulder at 655 nm besides the highenergy peak . The extended absorption edge in long wavelength region can be attributed to the more aggregated configuration formed in solid state . Compared to the main - chain copolymer of PBDTDPP - OR reported by the Jo group , this side - chain copolymer of PBDT - TDPP - S exhibited a 100 nm blue - shifted maximum absorption peak . The observed blue - shifted absorption phenomenon should be related to the less planar conformation and weaker D - A interaction for the side - chain D - A copolymer than the main - chain D - A copolymer .

The polymer has high molecular weight , good solubility , and a broad absorption spectrum in the range of 500 - 1100 nm . Field effect transistor charge mobility of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) arrived 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Bulk heterojunction type polymer solar cells based on PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PC 70 BM have broad photocurrent response wavelength range from 300 nm to 1.1 μm . High short - circuit current ( 14.87 mA / cm^2 ) and power conversion efficiency ( 2.71 % ) were achieved , which is a significant advance for efficient photovoltaic polymers that respond to the whole range of the solar spectrum . In the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have received a great deal of attention as a potential renewable energy source due to their potential advantages such as low fabrication cost , light weight , and fast production of large area devices by roll - to - roll solution processes . 1 Among photovoltaic polymers , regioregular poly(3 - hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT ) has been extensively studied . Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) photovoltaic device combining P3HT as the electron donor with [ 6,6]-phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) as the electron acceptor have achieved power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as high as 4 - 5 % . 2 However , the upper limit seems to have been reached for this material combination , as P3HT utilizes only photons located in the highenergy fraction of the solar spectrum with wavelengths below 650 nm . In fact , ∼ 40 % of the total solar energy lies in the range of 650 - 1100 nm , which is a strong driving force for developing lowbandgap polymers to utilize the solar energy in the near - infrared ( NIR ) range . 3 Recently , significant progress has been made in the photovoltaic application of novel low - bandgap polymers with optical absorption wavelengths in the range of 700 - 900 nm . 4 Nevertheless , design of efficient photovoltaic polymers with optical absorption and photocurrent response extending to wavelengths of micrometers remains challenging . The first example of this kind of micrometer - response polymer ( μmR - polymer ) was APFO - Green1 , reported by Ingan € as et al . in 2004.^5 Subsequently , considerable effort has been devoted to the design and synthesize of μmR - polymers via a synthetic strategy of combining electronrich units ( donors ) and electron - deficient units ( acceptors ) in a copolymer main chain . To date , no more than 10 μmR - polymers have been synthesized , which are primarily based on a very strong electron - deficient unit such as [ 1,2,5]thiadiazolo [ 3,4 - g]quinoxaline , 6 thienopyrazine , 7 or thieno [ 3,4 - c][1,2,5]thiadiazole .",

      "text": "8 The photocurrent response of all of these polymers extends to a wavelength of 1 μm ; however , the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of these PSCs in the wavelength range between 650 and 1100 nm is typically less than 10 % , which results in low overall PCEs under AM1.5 simulated solar light . Up to now , the highest PCE of μmR - polymer was just 1.1 % , based on poly(di-2 - thienylthienopyrazine ) by using complicated doubled active layers photovoltaic devices . 7 The fundamental requirements for promising photovoltaic μmR - polymers include the following : ( a ) broad absorption extending to or surpassing 1 μm to absorb more sunlight ; ( b ) a high LUMO energy level to allow effective photoinduced charge transfer from the polymers to the acceptor in the BHJ device and at the same time , a low HOMO level to keep the open circuit voltage ( V OC ) as high as possible ; ( c ) high carrier mobility to ensure that effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes suppresses photocurrent loss ; and ( d ) good solubility and appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives to form high - quality films by solution processing . The lack of successful photovoltaic μmR - polymers might be due to the difficulty of fulfilling all these requirements simultaneously with one polymer . Very recently , 3,6 - dithien-2 - yl-2 , 5 - dialkylpyrrolo[3,4 - c]pyrrole-1,4 - dione ( DTDPP ) was shown to be a promising building block for the design of photovoltaic polymers . 9 In our previous work , we also found the polymer , PDTP - DTDPP , based on DTDPP and dithieno[3,2 - b : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -d]pyrrole was one of potential μmRpolymers . The PCE based on this polymer arrived 1.1 % , one of highest value for μmR - polymers . 10 Herein , we present a new donor - acceptor alternative conjugated polymer , changing the alkyl chain in the diketopyrrolopyrrole segment of PDTP - DTDPP from 2 - ethylhexyl to n - butyl . This new polymer , referred to as PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) , is designed to fulfill the abovementioned requirements simultaneously as much as possible . As a result , bulk heterojunction - type polymer solar cells based on PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PC 70 BM have broad photocurrent response wavelength range from 300 nm to 1.1 μm . High shortcircuit current ( 14.87 mA / cm^2 ) and PCE ( 2.71 % ) were achieved , which is a significant advance for efficient μmR - polymers . * Corresponding author .

      "text": "The polymer exhibits excellent stability with an onset decomposition temperature ( 1 % weight loss ) at 280 ° C in air . This level of thermal stability is adequate for applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices . Optical Properties . The absorption spectrum of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) in film is shown in Figure 2 together with that of P3HT and normalized AM 1.5 G photon flux for comparison . The polymer has a broad absorption band in the range of 500 - 1100 nm with a tail extending to 1.3 μm . The full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) film is 324 nm , which is nearly a double that of P3HT film ( 158 nm ) . The optical band gap of the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) film is 1.13 eV , as estimated from the absorption onset ( 1100 nm ) . All these data indicate that PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) can utilize a larger fraction of solar light that P3HT as a possible material for applications in micrometer response photovoltaic devices . Electrochemical Properties . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was performed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of PDTP - DTDPP-(Bu ) . The CV curves were recorded referenced to an Ag / Ag þ electrode , which was calibrated against the ferroceneferrocenium ( Fc / Fc þ ) redox couple ( 4.8 eV below the vacuum level ) ; the CV curves are shown in Figure 3 . On the basis of the onset values of oxidation ( 0.10 V ) and reduction potential ( -1.17 V ) of the polymer , the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer were calculated as -4.90 and -3.63 eV , respectively . The electrochemical band gap thus determined is about 1.27 eV , which is slightly higher than the optical band gap . X - ray Diffraction ( XRD ) Measurements . The XRD patterns of the bulk samples of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH ) were recorded to understand their structures in the solid state . As shown in Figure 4 , both samples show diffraction peaks at low angles , which could be attributed to a lamellar structure . The d - spacings of the diffraction from ( 100 ) are 14.8 and 14.9 Å for PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH ) , respectively . The peaks around 24 ° for both polymers can be assigned to the face - to - face distance of the aromatic groups in the polymer chains arranged in the parallel direction . This π - π stacking distance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) was 3.64 Å , slightly lower than that of PDTP - DTDPP(EH ) ( 3.74 Å ) , which suggests that the butyl group in DPP segment is better for the close π - π stacking of the polymer backbones compared to the bulkier 2 - ethylhexyl group . Hole Mobility . It has been strongly suggested that high hole mobility is an important requirement for effective photovoltaic polymers .",

      "text": "We compared the experimental I SC under the simulated AM1.5 irradiation and the I SC calculated by integrating the EQE and the actual AM1.5 solar spectra . The calculated I SC from the EQE was 15 % less than the measured I SC . This discrepancy might be attributed to the spectral mismatch in the NIR region and / or device degradation during measurements in air . The highest PCE of PSCs based on the PDTP - DTDPP-(Bu ) : PC 70 BM system reached 2.71 % , which was lower than the 4 - 5 % of the P3HT : PCBM devices . This could be mainly attributed to the lower V OC ( ∼ 0.4 V ) . In addition , the charge separation efficiency in the current combination might not be as high as that in P3HT : PCBM , although it was difficult to estimate the internal quantum efficiency ( IQE ) accurately due to the light interference effect in the films . This might be attributed to the smaller LUMO offset or less ideal mixing morphology between the polymer and PCBM . Nevertheless , this performance is more than double of the highest PCE ( 1.1 % ) reported to date for μmR - polymers , even when the spectral mismatch in the NIR region above was considered . Such improvement of PCE comes from relatively highefficiency photon - to - electron conversion in the broad range of the absorption in the blend film of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PCBM . Considering the high EQE obtained in the range from 650 to 950 nm , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) is a promising candidate for applications in tandem photovoltaic devices in combination with conventional visible light absorbing materials . Furthermore , comparing the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) with PDTP - DTDPP(EH ) suggests that the alkyl chain in the DPP segment has a large influence on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers . A similar phenomenon was also observed for other D - A type photovoltaic polymers . 12 Synthesis of new μmR - polymers with different alkyl chain in both the DTDPP segment and the dithieno[3,2 - b : 2 ^ 0 , 3 0 -d]pyrrole segment and a detailed comparison of the properties of all these polymers are now in progress . The energy loss from the low output voltage of the photovoltaic devices ( 0.38 - 0.4 V ) can be attributed to the relatively large difference between the LUMO levels of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PCBM ( i.e. , small energy difference between the HOMO of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and LUMO of PCBM ) . There is still a room to lower the LUMO level of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) from 3.63 to ∼ 4.0 eV , which is ∼ 0.3 eV higher than the LUMO level of PCBM . If we can control the mixing morphology suitable for the charge separation , this energy offset might be enough to maintain a sufficient driving force for charge transfer and the higher V OC could be expected at the same time .",
