      "text": "The more effective quenching in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend than in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend implies two possibilities : ( i ) better exciton separation in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend films and ( ii ) a larger contact area between the polymer and the PC 70 BM through more optimal nanoscale phase separation . The former could be ruled out because the PEBDTPD polymer had a slightly higher LUMO level as the POBDTPD polymer . The latter was thus mainly responsible for the effective PL quenching , as confirmed from the film morphology studies . That is , the miscibility between polymers and PC 70 BM is an important factor for efficient exciton separation . Conclusively , morphology and PL quenching studies revealed that the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film has more favorable features for the higher J sc . Carrier mobilities were measured to estimate the ability of hole and electron transport and the carrier mobility balance . The hole mobilities of the polymers or the polymer : PC 70 BM blends were measured via the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method using hole - only devices ( ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer or polymer : PC 70 BM / Au ) . The JL 3 -V characteristics of the polymers and the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films are shown in Figure 7 . For all films , a slope of 2 in the log JL 3 - log V plot was observed , which is a signature of SCLC transport . The hole mobilities of the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers were estimated to be 1.5 × 10 ^ -4 and 1.3 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively . Although these hole mobilities of homopolymers were nearly identical , the hole mobility in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film decreased only slightly to 1.2 × 10 ^ -4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , whereas that in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film decreased significantly to 3.5 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The considerable mobility decrease in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film may result from the less uniform , more aggregated morphology as aforementioned . In addition , the electron mobilities of the polymer : PC 70 BM blends were measured using electron - only devices ( Al / polymer : PC 70 BM / Al ) . The electron mobilities were 8.8 × 10 ^ -6 and 1.1 × 10 ^ -5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM and PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blends , respectively . The hole and electron mobilities of the polymers and polymer : PC 70 BM blends are summarized in Table 3 . From this carrier mobility measurement , we concluded that the higher hole mobility of the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blends contributed to the higher J sc values as well . Moreover , the lower FF for the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend can be explained in terms of the balance between hole and electron transport .",

      "text": "their ter - polymers containing perylene units were synthesized using Suzuki coupling polymerization . The perylene units were introduced to improve the charge - transport ability by enhancing the π - π interaction between polymer chains . The resulting polymers were characterized by 1H NMR , elemental analysis , DSC , and TGA . The synthesized polymers were soluble in common organic solvents , and formed smooth and uniform spin - coated thin films . All of the polymers studied were found to exhibit good thermal stability , losing less than 5 % of their weight upon heating to approximately 350 ° C. Perylene - containing polymers showed higher field - effect mobilities than the corresponding PFDTBT or PFD2TBT polymers because of the enhanced π - π interaction between polymer chains upon the introduction of perylene units . Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al . The devices using the perylene - containing polymers showed higher short - circuit currents , and fill factors than the corresponding PFDTBT or PFD2TBT devices . One of the fabricated devices using a perylene - containing copolymer showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.16 % , with a short circuit current density of 9.61 mA / cm^2 , open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , and fill factor of 41 % . Extensive research has been carried out during the past decade on bulk heterojunction solar cells that utilize organic semiconducting materials . 1 The main advantages of organic photovoltaic devices ( OPVs ) are their lightweight , flexible nature , and their cost - effective manufacture by various printing technologies . The photoconversion process in OPVs is accomplished by efficient light absorption by conjugated polymers and accepting materials , charge separation at the interface of the donor polymer and the accepting materials , and subsequent charge collection at the electrodes . Matching the absorption of the conjugated polymer to the solar spectrum determines the ultimate performance of the solar cell . Among the variety of conjugated polymers that have been studied , poly(p - phenylenevinylene ) ( PPV ) , 2 poly(alkylfluorene ) ( PF ) , and polythiophene ( PT ) 3 derivatives are typical p - type electron donor materials . However , the performance of photovoltaic cells with these polymers is limited by their relatively large band gap energies , which are not yet optimized with respect to the solar spectrum . Therefore , the design and synthesis of new low - band gap polymers become very important to better harvest the solar spectrum , especially in the red and near - infrared ranges , which can lead to possible enhancements in the photocurrents of OPVs . 4 The most widely used approach for obtaining low - band gap structures is to utilize internal charge transfer ( ICT ) from an electron - donating to an electron - accepting moiety . 5 - 7 Some interesting structures using the ICT approach have been reported .",

The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / LiF / Al , where the polymers ( P1- P7 ) were used as electron donors and PC71BM ( or PC61BM ) was used as an electron acceptor . To optimize the morphology and ordering structure , different volume percentages of 1,8diiodooctane were added . 43 Figure 4 shows the current density versus voltage ( J - V ) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW / cm^2 . The V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE values of the PSC devices are summarized in Table 3 . From P1 to P4 , PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor , but for P5 , P6 , and P7 , PC61BM was used as the electron acceptor . P5 , P6 , and P7 blended with PC61BM showed higher PCE values than when they were blended with PC71BM in spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , which is most likely due to the lower miscibility of those polymers with PC71BM . 44 The V OC of these random terpolymers increased in the order P2 ( 0.74 V ) ∼ P3 ( 0.74 V ) < P4 ( 0.76 V ) < P5 ( 0.79 V ) < P6 ( 0.82 V ) . The trend in the V OC of the PSCs can be explained by the HOMO energy level of the polymers because the V OC is typically linearly proportional to the difference in energy between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor . 45 However , the PCE of the random terpolymers showed a the nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6 % in the order P3 ( 5.61 % ) > P4 ( 5.26 % ) > P2 ( 4.91 % ) > P5 ( 3.02 % ) > P6 ( 2.09 % ) ; this was consistent with the observed trend of the J SC . P3 exhibited the highest PCE value of 5.61 % among all polymers , including P1 and P7 , which was attributed to the broad absorption and increased V OC due to the deeper HOMO energy level .",

Herein , the EQE curves of the devices with the optimal performance are shown in Figure 8 . The devices showed a relatively high photoconversion efficiency over the whole wavelength range of 300 - 700 nm , with monochromatic EQE values around 50 - 60 % . Compared to the absorption spectra of pristine polymers , the significantly broadened EQE responses in the visible region can be attributed to both the intrinsic absorptions of the polymers and PC71BM . Also , it can be noted that devices based on PzNDTDTBO show stronger Field - Effect Transistor Properties . The performances of polymer field - effect transistors based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO were investigated using a bottom - gate , bottomcontact configuration . . ( Figure 9 ) . All devices with L = 5 μm showed the highest hole mobility at different annealing temperatures . The devices showed a typical p - type transporting characteristic measured under ambient conditions . As shown in Table 4 , for both polymers the annealing temperature tends to affect the hole mobility . All devices based on both polymers were annealed at 60 , 100 , 140 , 180 , 220 , and 260 ° C , and both polymers showed thermal stability on each device . Figure 10 shows the output curves and transfer characteristics of the OFETs based on the polymers at 25 ° C and optimal annealing temperature . ( Other OFETs data at different annealing temperatures are shown in Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2 . ) After thermal annealing , the hole mobilities of both copolymers are increased , which implies that the crystallinity of the polymer films and ordered lamellar structure of π - π closepacking for polymer main chain are significantly improved at higher temperatures . High current modulation is observed with on / off current ratio of 10 ^ 6 -10 ^ 7 for PzNDTBTBO while PzNDTDTBT shows relatively lower on / off ratio of 10 ^ 3 -10 ^ 4 . The resulting optimal P - channel transistors demonstrate high hole mobilities of 0.43 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and 0.34 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTBTBO . Both the hole mobilities are among the highest values for BT - or BO - based polymers . In order to deeply study the variation of the performances of OFETs of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO after annealing , the thin - film microstructures and topographies were investigated by X - ray diffraction ( XRD ) and AFM . Figure 11 shows XRD patterns of the polymer thin films deposited on OTSmodified Si / SiO 2 substrates . For both polymers , obvious diffraction peaks were detected before the samples were annealed , which indicates that some degree of crystallinity has been formed at room temperature . PzNDTDTBT showed a sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = 21.4 ° and two weak peaks at 23.8 ° and 26.6 ° for the as - prepared thin film .",

The weak electron - donating characteristic of TA , which has 2 - D extended conjugation by thiophene side groups , makes the copolymer exhibit a low - lying HOMO level of -5.5 eV with a low band - gap of 1.65 eV , which affords both high photo - voltage and photocurrent of the polymer solar cells . As a result , the solar cell device fabricated from the blend of the copolymer and PC71BM exhibits a promising power conversion efficiency of 7.02 % ( V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 13.1 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.67 ) . Moreover , the polymer solar cell as fabricated from the blend of the copolymer and di - perylene bisimide ( di - PBI ) as a non - fullerene electron acceptor exhibits a promising power conversion efficiency of 4.23 % with V OC = 0.77 V , J SC = 9.8 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.56 . This photovoltaic performance of the copolymer not only demonstrates that the TA is a promising electron - donating building block for a high performance low band - gap copolymer , but also the copolymer is compatible with both PC71BM and a non - fullerene acceptor for high efficiency polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have important advantages over inorganic - based solar cells such as low material - cost , ease of fabrication with low processing - cost and the potential for fabrication of large area and flexible solar cells . 1 In the last decade , remarkable progress in the performance of PSCs has been achieved by introducing a bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure in the active layer . [ 2][3][4][5 ] It has also been demonstrated that low band - gap conjugated polymers with broad absorption of the solar spectrum are promising active layer materials to achieve a high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) . 6,7 Hence , an effective approach to achieve a high PCE of PSC is to design and synthesize high performance conjugated polymers . [ 8][9][10][11 ] In recent efforts to develop high performance conjugated polymers , building blocks have been carefully designed for the conjugated polymers to have adequate energy levels , broad light absorption and strong self - assembly for use in BHJ PSC . [ 12][13][14][15][16][17][18 ] As one of the most promising building blocks for constructing low band - gap conjugated polymers , diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) has emerged as the desirable electron - withdrawing moiety . 19,20 Over the past five years , a variety of conjugated polymers containing DPP have been investigated as promising semiconductors for application in organic optoelectronics such as field effect transistors , memory devices and PSCs . Indeed , DPP - based conjugated polymers have achieved impressive PCEs up to 9 % by the combination of DPP and various electron - donating building blocks .",

In addition , two different DPP derivatives flanked with thiophene ( TDPP ) and furan ( FDPP ) were used to further optimize the energy levels and photovoltaic properties of the copolymer . 27 Both polymers exhibit a low band - gap of 1.65 eV , a deep HOMO energy level of -5.45 eV and a high hole mobility of ca . 10 ^ -2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Interestingly , a nanoscale BHJ morphology in the blend of the copolymer and PC71BM was well developed without the addition of a processing additive . The solar cell devices fabricated from the copolymers and PC71BM exhibited high PCEs of 7.0 % and 5.2 % for PTATDPP and PTAFDPP , respectively . Furthermore , the PSC fabricated from the blend of PTATDPP and a non - fullerene electron acceptor ( di - PBI ) showed a promising PCE of 4.23 % , demonstrating that PTATDPP has good compatibility with multiple electron acceptors for high efficiency PSCs .

Both copolymers also exhibit distinct vibronic shoulder peaks at 710 nm which are derived from the coupling of the electronic and vibrational transition . Therefore , these vibronic shoulder peaks at lower energy provide the evidence of strong π - π interactions , indicating that polymer chains are aggregated in the solution state . As compared to the solution state , the absorption onsets in the solid state are extended to 770 nm while the vibronic shoulders become stronger , indicating that both polymer chains exhibit a strong tendency to selfassemble in the solid state , which may induce crystallization . 37 This strong self - assembly of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP arises mainly from highly coplanar nature of the polymer backbone . Therefore , the two copolymers are expected to possess high crystallinity in the solid film state , which is beneficial to efficient charge transport in the device .",

Figure 5 shows the typical output and transfer curves of a representative device with PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) as the channel semiconductor . The hole mobility was estimated to be 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of other effective D - A type low - bandgap photovoltaic polymers ( 2.6 x 10 ^ -4 -3 x 10 ^ -3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) . 5 Although the FET mobility might not be directly correlated to the photovoltaic performance since the situation of the charge transport is quite different from each other , the higher carrier mobility still suggests effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes in the photovoltaic devices . Photovoltaic Properties . The bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) : PCBM ( or PC 70 BM ) / LiF / Al . PEDOT : PSS was spin - coated on a precleaned ITO - coated glass substrate . The film was dried at 150 ° C under a N 2 atmosphere for 5 min . After cooling the substrate , a solution of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) and PCBM ( or PC 70 BM ) mixture ( 1 : 2 w / w ) was spin - coated , where a blend of chloroform and o - dichlorobenzene ( 4 : 1 v / v ) was used as the solvent . The devices were completed by evaporating LiF / Al as the cathode . The effective area ( 2 mm x 3 mm ) of the PSCs was defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light ( Scheme 2 ) . PC 70 BM was also used as an acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PCBM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region , which can compensate for the poor absorption of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu ) in this range . Figure 6 shows the I - V curves of the devices with the best photovoltaic performance under the illumination of AM 1.5 ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) .
