    "sentence": "The relatively deep HOMO energy level of the polymer can be favourable for achieving high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) in PCS devices and also might benefit the stability of the polymer by avoiding unintentional p-doping. 15 The photovoltaic properties of the polymer were investigated in BHJ solar cell devices with the device structure of ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC61BM / MoO 3 / Al ( Table 1 and Fig. 4 ). The polymers were used as donor and PC61BM was used as acceptor. The active layer was processed with chlorobenzene ( CB ) and the concentration of donor material was 10 mg / mL. Solar cells were characterized under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm^-2 from a Newport solar simulator. The short - circuit current densities ( J sc ) of devices were significantly enhanced with the raising weight ratios of PC61BM to donor polymer ( Table 1 ). The fill factors ( FF ) of devices also increased with the raising of the ratios. However , the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) showed little change with change of the ratios. Solar cells based on PNDFT-DTBT:PC61BM ( 1 : 3 ) as the photoactive layer ( thickness of 85 nm ) exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 5.22% , a J sc of 8.21 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.89 V , and a high FF of 0.72. The PNDFT - DTBT achieved the highest performance in solar cell devices among all polymers based on NDF building blocks. The thermal annealing of the active layers resulted in dropping of photovoltaic performances. The adverse effect of annealing on photovoltaic performance could be ascribed to the macro-scale phase separation. The similar phenomenon has been reported on other poly(3-alkylthiophene ). 32 Addition of processing additive , diiodooctane ( DIO ) 33 before spin - coating did not show any improvement on device performances. Chloroform was also used as processing solvent. The devices processed with chloroform showed similar performances as devices processed with CB. from 300 to 700 nm and the highest EQE value of the devices exceeded 60% ( Fig. 4b ). The morphology of active layer plays an important role in the device performances. Proper morphology is necessary not only for exciton dissociation but also for charge transport to respective contacts. Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) 5 was used to investigate the morphology of polymer / PC BM active layer. Topography and phase images were taken from the film of polymer / PC61BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) blends casted from CB ( Fig. 5 ). The active layer showed good phase separation with a rootmean - square roughness ( RMS ) of 2.46 nm. 10 A new NDF building block ( NDFT ) has been designed and synthesized as building block for conjugated polymer. The new monomer was fully characterized and was applied in synthesis of conjugated polymer ( PNDFT - DTBT ).",

    "sentence": "We have developed a new multifused indacenodithieno [3,2-b]thiophene arene ( IDTT ) unit where the central phenylene is covalently fastened with the two outer thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( TT ) rings , forming two cyclopentadiene rings embedded in a heptacyclic structure. This rigid and coplanar IDTT building block was copolymerized with electron - deficient acceptors , 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( BT ) , 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( FBT ) and 1,3-dibromo-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) via Stille polymerization , respectively. Because the higher content of the thienothiophene moieties in the fully coplanar IDTT structure facilitates π-electron delocalization , these new polymers show much improved light - harvesting abilities and enhanced charge mobilities compared to PDITTBT copolymer using hexacyclic diindenothieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( DITT ) as the donor moieties. The device using PIDTTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) exhibited a decent power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.8% . Meanwhile , the solar cell using PIDTTFBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 in wt % ) blend exhibited a greater V oc value of 0.9 V and a larger J sc of 10.08 mA / cm^2 , improving the PCE to 4.2% . The enhanced V oc is attributed to the lower - lying of HOMO energy level of PIDTTFBT as a result of fluorine withdrawing effect on the BT unit. A highest PCE of 4.3% was achieved for the device incorporating PIDTTTPD : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 in wt % ) blend . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) using organic p - type ( donor ) and ntype ( acceptor ) semiconductors have attracted tremendous scientific and industrial interest. 1 The most critical challenge at molecular level is to develop p - type conjugated polymers that can simultaneously possess sufficient solubility for processability and miscibility with an n - type material , low band gap ( LBG ) for strong and broad absorption spectrum to capture more solar photons , and high hole mobility for efficient charge transport. 2 The most useful approach to make a LBG polymer is to connect electron - rich donor and electron - deficient acceptor segments along the conjugated polymer backbone. Thiophene and benzene aromatic rings are the most important ingredients to comprise p - type conjugated polymers. Benzenebased derivatives such as tricyclic 2,7-fluorene or 2,7-carbazole units have shown to serve as useful building blocks to construct donor - acceptor polymers having deep - lying HOMO energy levels that contribute to achieve high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) ( > 0.8 V ) for PSCs. 3 However , the intrinsic drawback is that these polymers usually possess relatively large optical band gaps ( > 2 eV ) that limit their ability to harvest sunlight and thus result in moderate short - circuit current ( J sc ). On the other hand , because of the lower aromaticity to adapt more quinoidal resonance structure , thiophene - based D-A polymers have better light absorption ability to permit greater J sc .",

    "sentence": "5,6-Difluorobenzothiadiazole ( FBT ) unit with two fluorine atoms on BT unit also emerges as a superior derivative for adjusting the molecular properties. 14 In this research , we report the detailed synthesis of the distannyl-IDTT monomer which was copolymerized with BT , FBT , TPD acceptor moieties to prepare a new class of D-A alternating IDTT - based copolymers ( Scheme 1 ). Their thermal , optical and electrochemical properties have been carefully characterized. Preliminary results showed that the IDTT - based polymers are promising for photovoltaic solar cell applications. Synthesis. The synthetic route for Sn-IDTT monomer is depicted in Scheme 2. Stille coupling of diethyl 2,5dibromoterephthate with 2-(tributylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene yielded compound 1. Double nucleophilic addition of the ester groups in 1 by (4-octyloxy)phenyl magnesium bromide led to the formation of benzylic alcohols in 2 which was subjected to intramolecular Friedel - Crafts cyclization under acidic condition to furnish the heptacyclic IDTT arene in a good yield of 81% . Bromination of IDTT by Nbromosuccinimide generated Br - IDTT in a high yield of 87% . Finally , Br - IDTT was lithiated by n-butyllithium followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride to afford the distannyl Sn-IDTT in a moderate yield of 54% . Sn-IDTT monomer was copolymerized with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( BT ) , 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( FBT ) and 1,3-dibromo-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) acceptor monomers via Stille coupling to afford three donor - acceptor copolymers , poly(indacenodithieno [3,2-b]thiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole ) ( PIDTTBT , M n = 16.6 kDa , PDI = 1.7 ) , poly ( indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-alt-difluorobenzothiadiazole ) ( PIDTTFBT , M n = 24.0 kDa , PDI = 1.2 ) and poly ( indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-alt-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ) ( PIDTTTPD , M n = 31.3 kDa , PDI = 2.0 ) , respectively ( Scheme 3 ). These copolymers purified by successive Soxhlet extraction and precipitation showed narrower molecular weight. The resulting copolymers flanked with four side chains on IDTT unit possess excellent solubilities in common organic solvents , such as chloroform , toluene , and THF. Thermal and Optical Properties. The thermal stability of the polymers was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ). PIDTTBT , PIDTTFBT , and PIDTTTPD exhibited sufficiently high decomposition temperatures ( T d ) of 414 , 391 , and 384 °C , respectively. UV - vis absorption spectra of the three polymers in THF solutions and in thin films are shown in Figure 1 and the correlated optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. PIDTTBT and PIDTTFBT showed two obvious absorption bands in the spectra. The longer wavelength absorbance is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the electron - rich and the electron - deficient segments. However , the localized transition bands and ICT bands of PIDTTTPD overlap into a broad band covering the whole visible region from 400 to 700 nm , indicating that the accepting strength of TPD is weaker than that of BT unit.",

    "sentence": "The absorption spectra of the three polymers shift toward longer wavelengths from the solution state to the solid state , indicating that the coplanar structure of IDTT is capable of inducing strong interchain interactions. The optical band gaps ( E g opt ) deduced from the onset of absorption in the solid state are determined to be 1.69 eV for PIDTTBT , 1.77 eV for PIDTTFBT and 1.95 eV for PIDTTTPD. Note that the optical band gap of PDITTBT is 2.15 eV , which is significantly larger than that of PIDTTBT , suggesting that the heptacyclic IDTT unit with higher content of thienothiophene moieties indeed facilitates the π-electron delocalization compared to the hexacyclic DITT unit. Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to examine the electrochemical properties and determine the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energies of the polymers ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ). The three polymers showed stable and reversible p - doping and n - doping processes , which are important prerequisites for p - type semiconductor materials. The LUMO energy levels of PIDTTBT , PIDTTFBT , and PIDTTTPD are determined to be -3.40 , -3.50 , and -3.18 eV , respectively. The LUMO energy levels are higher than that of the PC71BM acceptor ( -3.8 eV ) to ensure energetically favorable electron transfer. It should be noted that the HOMO energy of PIDTTFBT ( -5.30 eV ) is lower than that of PIDTTBT ( -5.43 eV ) due to the two electron - withdrawing fluorine atoms on the BT units. 14 Furthermore , PIDTTTPD shows the lowest HOMO energy level of -5.45 eV , indicating that TPD acceptor unit is also capable of lowering the HOMO energy level of the resulting polymer. The HOMO energy levels are within the ideal range to ensure better air - stability and greater attainable V oc . Theoretical Calculations. In order to gain more insight into the molecular orbital properties of the polyaromatic πelectron systems , quantum - chemical calculations were performed with the Gaussian09 suite employing the B3LYP and TD-B3LYP density functionals in combination with the 6-311G ( d,p ) electronic properties , all the side - chain substituents were replaced with methyl groups for simplicity. Repeating units , denoted as IDTTBT , IDTTFBT , and IDTTTPD , in their most stable conformations were used as simplified model compounds for PIDTTBT , PIDTTFBT , and PIDTTTPD , respectively. The calculated HOMO / LUMO energy , excitation energy , oscillator strength , and configurations of the excited states are summarized in Table 2 and the frontier orbitals , HOMO ( H ) , LUMO ( L ) and the closeby LUMO+1 ( L+1 ) are illustrated in Table 3. The HOMO electron density distribution of IDTTTPD is analogous to that of IDTTFBT and IDTTBT , where the electron density is not only distributed homogeneously along the molecular backbone of the IDTT moiety but also on parts of the acceptor.",

    "sentence": "Given that the contribution of the IDTT moiety to the HOMO energy level should be similar among the three compounds , the difference in the HOMO energy level therefore mainly depends on the nature of the acceptors. Consistent with the electrochemical experiments , the calculated HOMO energy levels of the three model compounds follow the order : IDTTTPD ( -5.25 eV ) < IDTTFBT ( -5.23 eV ) < IDTTBT ( -5.18 eV ). On the contrary , the LUMO of IDTTTPD is higher in energy than that of IDTTFBT and IDTTBT. IDTTFBT and IDTTBT have similar LUMO electron density patterns of which the electron density is mainly located on the acceptors ( BT and FBT ). Instead , the electron density of LUMO in IDTTTPD is not only localized on TPD unit but span from TPD to IDTT moieties. Involvement of the IDTT orbitals in the LUMO of IDTTTPD may result in a high - lying energy level of LUMO. As listed in Table 2 , although there are variations in the absolute values , the calculated absorptions are still in good agreement with the experimental values. In order to have further understanding of these electronic transitions , electron density difference maps ( EDDMs ) were conducted ( Figure 3 ). 15 The electronic transitions can therefore be visualized through EDDMs. Red indicates a decrease in charge density , while green indicates an increase. For IDTTBT , the lowest energy singlet electronic transition ( λ calc = 597 nm ; λ max,exp = 622 nm ) indicates a pronounced intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) from IDTT to BT. The transitions at λ calc = 433 and 430 nm are close in energy and may not be separable. In fact , in the UV absorption spectrum , only one absorption peak ( λ max,exp = 420 nm ) was observed. On the basis of the EDDMs , both transitions belong to charge separations from the molecular backbone of IDTT and one 4-methoxyphenyl side chain to the BT unit. The lowest energy singlet electronic transition ( λ calc = 607 nm ; λ max,exp = 616 nm ) of IDTTFBT is a ICT band , which is basically caused by the electron transfer from IDTT to FBT. The transitions at λ calc = 435 and 431 nm are also inseparable in the experimental spectrum ( λ max,exp = 415 nm ). One at λ calc = 435 nm is assigned to the ICT from the flanking 4methoxyphenyl groups of IDTT to BT , and the other one at λ max = 431 nm only occurs at localized regions. Lastly , the most probable vertical excitation of IDTTTPD is calculated to be 521 nm , which deviates slightly from the λ max,exp of 589 nm. It mainly results from the ICT from IDTT to TDP and the π-π* transition within the IDTT unit has a minor contribution. Organic Field Effect Transistors.",

    "sentence": "To investigate the mobilities of the polymers , organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) were fabricated in the bottom - contact / top - contact geometry as described in the Experimental Section ( Table 4 and Figure 4 ). The hole mobilities were deduced from the transfer characteristics of the devices in the saturation regime. The polymers - based OFETs using SiO 2 as gate dielectric was treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane ( ODTS ) to form a selfassembly monolayer ( SAM ). With the modification of a ODTS - SAM layer along with annealing temperature at 150 and 200 °C , the hole mobilities of the three polymers were determined to be 7 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , 1 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , and 1 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with the on - off ratios of 1.9 × 10^3 , 1.4 × 10^7 , and 3.2 × 10^4 for PIDTTBT , PIDTTFBT , and PIDTTTPD devices , respectively. It should be mentioned that PDITTBT using hexacyclic DITT as the donor showed a much lower mobility of 7 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . 11 This result again indicates that higher content of thienothiophene unit can improve the charge transporting properties. Photovoltaic Characteristics.

The characterization data are summarized in Table 5 and the J-V curves of these polymers are shown in Figure 5. The blend ratio of the active layers shown in the Table 5 is the result of the optimized conditions for the devices.

Even though the device derived from PIDTTFBT has the highest V oc and J sc , it does not show a better PCE than the PIDTTTPD - based device , which is due to the fact that the device of PIDTTTPD has a much larger FF than that of PIDTTBT. To confirm the accuracy of the measurements of the devices , the corresponding external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra were measured under illumination of monochromatic light ( Figure 4 ). The J sc values calculated from integration of the EQE spectra agree well with the J sc obtained from the J-V measurements . Compared to thiophene unit , C 2h -symmetry thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( TT ) unit with higher aromatic stabilization energy and coplanar geometry is a promising building block for donor - acceptor conjugated polymers to obtain higher V oc and J sc . However , introducing aliphatic side chains on the βpositions of TT units leads to severe steric hindrance - induced twisting between the neighboring aryls in the polymer backbone. A straightforward approach to circumvent this deficiency is to embed TT units in a multifused ladder - type structure. A hexacyclic diindenothieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( DITT ) unit has been first developed. Nevertheless , DITT possesses high content of high - aromaticity benzene rings resulting in relatively large optical band gap and thus limited J sc . By reversing the arrangement of TT and benzene units in the DITT framework , we have successfully developed a new multifused heptacyclic structure , indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( IDTT ) , where the central phenylene ring is fused with two outer TT rings. The ladder - type IDTT framework can be easily constructed by Friedel - Crafts annulation. The optical and electrochemical properties of the resulting polymers have been characterized experimentally and theoretically. Compared to the hexacyclic DITT unit , this heptacyclic IDTT has extended conjugation length with significantly increasing the content of the thiophene moieties. Because of the more favorable π-electron delocalization , IDTT - based polymers show much improved light - harvesting abilities and enhanced charge mobilities.

Due to the introduce of hyperconjugated side chain , the resulted polymer exhibited good thermal stability with a high decomposition temperature of 437 °C , low band - gap of 1.67eV with an absorption onset of 742 nm in solid film , and a deep highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) energy level of -5.26eV. Finally , the polymer solar cells ( PSC ) device based on this polymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) showed a best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.57% with an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.78 V , a short - circuit current density ( Jsc ) of 8.83 mA / cm^2 and a fill factor ( FF ) of 53% . Polymer solar cells ( PSC ) have recently attracted significant attention as the most promising technique due to their potential advantages , such as lightweight , flexible nature and cost - effective manufacturing process. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] As a research focus in both industry and academia , the development of PSC has achieved significant progress recently and a large amount of polymers with high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6-9 % have been developed. [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] In PSC , the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) devices structure has been proven to be the most successful structure , 15 where the active layer is consisted of a nanoscale bicontinuous phase - separated conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives. The molecular design of new conjugated polymers is one of the most important , though challenging topics. Most efforts have been focused on conjugated polymers with alternating electron - rich ( Donor ) and electron - deficient ( Acceptor ) units , known as D-A structured polymers. [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] As the donor unit , benzodithiophene ( BDT ) unit has a symmetric and planar conjugated structure , which can easily realize ordered π-π stacking with a large domain size. Since Hou and Yang reported primarily the synthesis and electronic properties of BDT - based copolymers with alkoxy substituent in 2008 , 24 the BDT unit has become one of the most employed donor moieties for polymers in PSC. [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] However , in addition to the planar backbone , the BDT core offers the flexibility of attaching different substitutes on the central benzene core to fine - tune the energy level of the polymer. In 2010 , Yang group synthesized a donor - acceptor polymer ( PBDTTBT ) containing an alkyl substituted thienyl side chained BDT on the copolymer backbone , and the polymer based solar cells exhibited a 5.66% PCE which is one of the highest values at that time.",

    "sentence": "34 Then the use of conjugated side chain has been demonstrated to both enhance the solubility of the copolymer and contribute to extending the π-conjugation from the backbone to the lateral substituents , leading to two - dimensional or 2D π-conjugated systems. [35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46] Thiophene - based π-conjugated side chains , with the high electronic density and strong tendency to aggregate , are particularly suitable for the described purposes. For example , Huo et al. 11 have attached different substituents , alkoxy and alkylthienyl , to the benzene core of BDT and exploited the properties of corresponding polymers. The results show that replacing the alkoxy with alkylthienyl substituents on the BDT core increases the thermal stability , gives broader absorption spectra , lowers the highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbit ( LUMO ) energy levels , and overall enhances the photovoltaic properties ( PCE up to 7% ) of the polymers. In 2012 , the Mihaela C. Stefan group extended the π-conjugation of the side chain from a single thiophene unit to two thiophenes , and reported the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of two donor - acceptor polymers containing 3,3′,5-trihexylbithienyl substituted benzodithiophene and benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole or 5-hexylthieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as donor and acceptor. The resulted polymers exhibited good solubility and high V oc values up to 1.04 V because of the low HOMO energy level but moderate Jsc of 5.36 mA / cm^2 and FF of 47% . 47 In this paper , we further extended the π-conjugation by attaching a hyperconjugated side chain to the BDT unit and synthesized the polymer P3TBDTDTBT. In this polymer , four dodecyl chains were selected to guarantee that high molecular weight polymer would be soluble in organic solvents and no side - chained DTBT was chosen to lower the band - gap and reduce the steric repulsion between the adjacent monomer units , which would assist the polymer backbone to adopt a more planar conformation. The polymer exhibited a high decomposition temperature of 437 °C , a broad absorption in the range of 300-742 nm , and a low - lying HOMO energy level of -5.26eV. The Polymer Chemistry Accepted Manuscript best PSC device based on this polymer and PCBM showed a PCE of 3.57% with a V oc of 0.78 V , a Jsc of 8.83 mA / cm^2 and a FF of 52% . The thermal properties of the polymer P3TBDTDTBT was measured by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ). Seen from Fig. 1 , TGA indicates that P3TBDTDTBT exhibits high thermal stability and the decomposition temperature ( T d ) at 5% weight loss is about 437 ° C. This high decomposition temperature prevents the deformation of the polymer morphology and the degradation of the polymeric active layer under applied electric fields in solar cell devices. DSC reveals that there is no obvious glass transition for the polymer before 437 °C .",

The absorption peak wavelength ( λ max ) is 628 and 656 nm in solution and thin film , while the absorption onset wavelength ( λ onset ) is 730 and 742nm. The polymer shows broad absorption from 300 to 742 nm , covering the whole visible spectrum , with two distinct absorption bands at around 392 and 628 nm in solution. The peak at 392 nm is corresponding to the π-π* transition of the conjugated polymer backbone and the peak at 628 nm is attributed to a strong intermolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the electron - donating BDT and the electron - accepting DTBT units in the main chain. In the solid film , the absorption spectra become broader and show a 28 nm red - shift in comparison with their solution absorption , which indicates planar polymer chain structure and effective interchain π-π stacking in the solid state. Very interestingly , the solid absorption spectra demonstrate a more pronounced shoulder peak at Page 9 of 28 Polymer Chemistry approximately 615 nm , which can be attributed to the slightly increased interchain π-π stacking and extension of the conjugation of two dimensional structures in the solid state 49 . The optical band - gap of P3TBDTDTBT is 1.67eV determined from the onset of the UV - vis absorption in thin solid film . Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was performed to investigate the redox behavior of the polymer and also to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer 50 . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined by measuring the onset oxidation potential ( E onset ox ) and reduction potential ( E onset re ) of the polymer film. To obtain the oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymer film , the reference electrode was calibrated using ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) , which had a redox potential with an absolute energy level of -4.80eV in vacuum ; the potential of this external standard under the same conditions was 0.44 V versus Ag / Ag + . As shown in Fig. 3 , the polymer showed an E onset ox at 0.90 V and an E onset re at -0.80V. Accordingly , the HOMO and LUMO energy values ( E HOMO and E LUMO ) were calculated using the following equation : 50 The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated to be -5.26eV and -3.56eV. The energy band - gap calculated from the HOMO and LUMO energy levels is 1.70eV which is consistent with the optical band - gap ( 1.67eV ) estimated from absorption onset in thin solid film. E HOMO = -(E onset ox +4.36)eV ; E LUMO = -(E onset re +4.36)eV .

Replacing the carbon atom in the side chain of polymer PBDTQS with a thiophene ring could increase the conjugation length and improve the absorption in the visible region of the copolymer PBDTQTS and PTQTS. Furthermore , polymer PTQTS exhibited a more planar backbone and increased intermolecular π-stacking compared to PBDTQTS , which was because the thiophene unit in PTQTS had smaller size and less steric hindrance than those of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']-dithiophene unit in PBDTQTS.

The results implied that the PTQTS with thiophene as the donor unit and QTS as the acceptor unit in the main chain would be a promising donor candidate in the application of polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on the bulk hetero - junction ( BHJ ) active layers of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives have attracted significant attention due to their light weight , low cost , and flexibility. [1][2][3][4] To obtain donor materials with ideal performance , tremendous efforts have been devoted to tuning their properties through molecular designs. [5][6][7][8] The key issue in the studies of PSCs is to increase power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of the devices. Recently , PCEs of the BHJ PSCs have acquired significant improvement due to the development of new polymers with low band gap via intra-molecular charge - transfer ( ICT ) donor (D)-acceptor ( A ) strategy.

[12][13][14][15][16] PCE has exceeded 9% for single junction solar cells 17,18 and 10% for tandem solar cells. 19,20 It is still very challenging to simultaneously balance the absorptions , energy levels , and charge mobilities of PSCs for linear D-A conjugated polymers. In recent years , side chain conjugated polymers , which had the donor or acceptor building block with conjugated structure in the side chain directions , are attracting attention for modulating the electronic structures of polymers. [21][22][23][24][25] Based on this strategy , Hou et al. have successfully proven the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (BDT)-polymers with conjugated structure in the side chain directions show higher hole transport property and photovoltaic performance. 26 In addition , some acceptor building blocks , with conjugated side chain have also been reported.",

Therefore , some groups designed new quinoxaline derivatives by replacing a phenyl group with a thiophene moiety , 29,30 which may further improve the absorption capability of the donor materials. Moreover , it is important to improve the packing orders of the D-A conjugated polymer because the mobility of the polymer film is highly related to the inter-chain π-π stacking of the polymers. Considering the donor - acceptor interaction and the spatial steric hindrance caused by the branched alkyl chains , it could be better that the small donor units dock into the cavity of large acceptor cores. 31 This \" molecular docking \" strategy would reduce the steric hindrance of side chains and increase the inter-chain π-π stacking of the polymer , and improve the carrier mobility of the active layer in devices. Pei 's group has introduced a \" molecular docking \" strategy and demonstrated that polymer symmetry and backbone curvature affect the inter-chain of isoindigo - based polymers in film , ultimately leading to improved device performance. 32 Based on the above considerations , a delicate balance between the steric hindrance and conjugated length is needed via judiciously designed polymers. For example , it is well known that increasing the length of the side chains will enhance the steric hindrance , thus increase the solubility of the polymer , which may further lead to better film processability. 33 However , it is also obvious that too much steric hindrance will force the backbone of the polymer to bend out of coplanarity , which may influence the mobility and light - harvesting ability of the active layer. 34 In the case of conjugated length , a similar problem exists. Large conjugated length will enhance the π-π stacking and decrease the band gap of the polymers , which would surely increase the mobility and light harvesting - ability of the active layer. 35 However , if the conjugated length is significantly large , the solubility and film processability of the polymers will be influenced , which may further affect the morphology of the active layer. 36 In this context , we tried to improve the photovoltaic performance of quinoxaline - based conjugated polymer from the view of both conjugated length in the side chain direction and steric hindrance of building blocks. Firstly , we introduced an alkylthio substitute on the quinoxaline and synthesized a new low band gap conjugated polymer poly{4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-alt-2,3-bis(n-octylthiomethyl)qui-noxaline} ( PBDTQS ).

The UV - vis absorption properties of the obtained copolymers were measured in both chloroform solution ( Fig. 2a ) and as thin films on quartz slides ( Fig. 2b ). As shown in Fig. 2 , all the resulting copolymers had similar absorption profiles and showed two absorption peaks at around 380 and 600 nm , which is a typical feature for D-A copolymers.",

    "sentence": "The absorption peak around 380-410 nm originated from the π-π* transition of the polymer main chain , and the absorption in the wavelength range of 500-800 nm were mainly due to the charge transfer from the donor units to acceptor units. In comparison with PBDTQS , the maximum absorption peaks of PBDTQTS and PTQTS in the long wavelength range were obviously redshifted , suggesting that thiophene unit could increase the conjugated length in the backbone of the copolymers. A Similar behavior was observed for the absorption spectra of these copolymers as thin solid films ( Fig. 2b ). Compared to the absorption peaks in solution , the absorption peaks of the films in the wavelength range of 500-800 nm showed larger red - shifts around 25 , 8 , 51 nm for PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS , respectively. The reason could be explained by the formation of π-stacked structures in the solid state which could facilitate charge transportation for photovoltaic applications. Moreover , it also indicated that PTQTS possessed stronger π-stacking ability than the other two copolymers in solid state due to the small thiophene unit , which could decrease the steric hindrance of building blocks and improve the interchain π-π stacking. The optical band gaps calculated from the onset of the film absorption spectra were about 1.77 , 1.70 and 1.58 eV for PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS , respectively. It is worth noting that the E opt g of PTQTS was considerably lower than those of PBDTQS and PBDTQTS , which would facilitate a high absorption in green - red region of the solar spectrum. Thus , PSCs based on PTQTS and PC61BM probably exhibited a better J sc value and photovoltaic performance than that of other two polymers . To investigate the differences in electrochemical properties , the redox potentials of PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS films deposited onto a platinum electrode were studied by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurement. The HOMO and LUMO levels of polymers were calculated from their onset oxidation potential ( φ ox ) and onset reduction potential ( φ red ) according to the following equations : E HOMO = -e(φ ox + 4.8 - φ 1 / 2 , FeCp 2 ) ( eV ) and E LUMO = -e(φ red + 4.8 - φ 1 / 2 , FeCp 2 ) ( eV ) , where the unit of potential is V ( vs. SCE ). 45 As shown in Fig. 3 , the onset oxidation potentials of PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS were determined to be 0.88 , 0.88 and 0.85 V , corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of -5.29 , -5.29 and -5.26 eV , respectively. Compared with polymer TTQ ( -5.06 eV ) , 28 these three copolymers showed lower HOMO levels due to the introduction of the alkylthio side chain.",

This was mainly due to the increased light absorption in long wavelength range of this polymer. It could be seen that replacing the BDT unit in PBDTQS and PBDTQTS with a smaller thiophene unit could reduce the steric hindrance of the backbone of PTQTS , which leads to an enhanced intermolecular π-π stacking. Thus , the J sc and FF of PTQTS were obviously improved compared with PBDTQS and PBDTQTS. The device performance of our polymer PTQTS , especially the V oc value , was lower than that of the reported polymer TQ1 by Ergang Wang 's group , 28 which was mainly due to the higher HOMO level of polymer PTQTS because the thiophene substitute group on quinoxaline unit may have stronger electron - donating nature than the phenyl group in TQ1. 48 To verify the accuracy of the J-V measurements , the corresponding external quantum efficiencies ( EQE ) of the devices were measured and shown in Fig. 5. All the three polymers displayed broadened absorption from 350-800 nm.

As shown in Fig. 6 , the surface of PBDTQS : PC61BM blend film exhibited a root - meansquare roughness ( RMS ) of 2.09 nm and a large phase separation , which was not favorable for the charge transfer from the polymer to PC61BM , thus limited the efficiency of the resulting device. 47 The surfaces of PBDTQTS : PC61BM and PTQTS : PC61BM blend films spin - coated from CB showed relatively smooth surfaces with RMS of 1.51 and 1.80 nm , respectively.",

In addition to the absorption and energy levels , charge carrier mobility is another crucial factor for achieving high - efficiency devices. The hole mobilities of the three polymers were measured using the space - charge - limited current ( SCLC ) method , with the device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymers : PC61BM / Au ( as shown in Fig. 7 ). The SCLC is described as J SCLC = 9^8 ε 0 ε r μ h V 2 L 3ð1Þ here J stands for current density , ε 0 is the permittivity of free space , ε r is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium , μ h is the hole mobility , V is the internal potential in the device and L is the thickness of the active layer.

In summary , three copolymers ( PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS ) with alkylthio side chain on the quinoxaline acceptor were designed and synthesized. The UV - vis absorptions , thermal stability , energy levels , morphology and photovoltaic characteristics of the three copolymers were systematically evaluated to understand the relationships between the polymer structures and the photovoltaic performances.

Furthermore , polymer PTQTS exhibited a more planar backbone and increased intermolecular π-stacking compared to PBDTQTS , which was due to the thiophene unit in PTQTS having a smaller size and less steric hindrance than those of BDT unit in PBDTQTS.",

Three polymers were prepared by Suzuki polymerization , using the same donoracceptor - donor segment but with different comonomers. The goal was to investigate how the optical and electronic properties of the polymers were influenced by the different comonomers. Electrochemical spectroscopy , using square - wave voltammetry , shows that increasing the electrondonating strength of the comonomer will raise the HOMO energy level of the polymer , resulting in a decreased band gap. This result is also manifested by comparing open - circuit voltages from the corresponding laboratory fabricated solar cells. The best performing photovoltaic cell , based on APFO - Green15 / [60]PCBM ( 1 : 4 w / w ) , reached a J sc of 4.2 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.73 V , and a FF of 0.54 , giving a PCE of 1.7% . Conjugated polymers are promising candidates for photoinduced charge generation and transport media in solar cells , with efficiencies of around 6% recently reported. [1][2][3] In order to make polymer solar cells competitive , their efficiencies need to be increased , a challenge addressed to polymer design , synthesis , and device fabrication. An ideal p - type conjugated polymer has to simultaneously combine strong absorption , small band gap , high hole mobility , good film - forming properties , and suitable energy levels with respect to the n - type material. If the band gap of the polymer is decreased , the absorption spectrum will be broadened , making it possible to utilize more photons for charge generation in the photovoltaic cell. Decreasing the band gap means that either the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of the conjugated polymer is raised or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) is lowered. A raised HOMO gives a lower photovoltage of the device and a lowered LUMO decreases the offset to the LUMO of the n - type material used. An offset of approximately 0.3 eV is required to maintain a sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation and prevent recombination of photogenerated charges. 4,5 In this report we present three small band gap polymers with alternating electron - donating ( D ) and electron - accepting ( A ) units. This design , using DAD - segments in the polymer backbone , creates an internal charge transfer , which reduces the band gap. [6][7][8][9] To investigate how the choice of comonomer influences the polymer properties , one DAD - monomer was Suzuki polymerized with three different comonomers resulting in two low band gap para-phenylene ( LBPP ) polymers and one alternating polyfluorene ( APFO ) polymer. The three comonomers differ in electron - donating strength , which results in three polymers with different optical and electrochemical properties.",

    "sentence": "The relative position of the onsets of the CV oxidation waves is in agreement with the SWV data presented in Table 2. Additionally , the results from CV in Fig. 1b clearly indicate the electrochemical reversibility of the polymers. The electrochemical data show , that when going from APFO - Green15 to LBPP-4 and finally to LBPP-3 , the oxidation waves are raised towards vacuum implying a smaller band gap. The reason for this is explained by the increasing electron - donating strength of the comonomers. The dioctyloxy phenylene unit present in LBPP-3 is very electron rich due to the electrondonating character of the octyloxy side - chains. This strengthens the electron - donating moieties of the DAD - segment which results in a strong intramolecular charge transfer. The smaller band gap of LBPP-3 compared to LBPP-4 is mainly a result of a raised HOMO , whereas the LUMO position is practically unaffected by the substitution of comonomer. Consequently , APFO - Green15 shows the lowest lying HOMO and largest electrochemical band gap as a result of having the weakest electron - donating comonomer of the three polymers. Looking at the estimated LUMO positions it is evident that all three polymers guarantee a downhill energy offset for charge transfer to [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM , which LUMO positions previously have been estimated to be -4.1 eV by SWV. 17 The electrochemical band gaps of the three polymers range from 1.7 - 2.0 eV . Absorption spectroscopy , measuring transitions between electronic states , provides essential information about the spectral coverage and the magnitude of the band gap. Although information about the location of molecular orbital energies can not be obtained , optical absorption measurements have great resemblance with the charge - generation process in a photovoltaic cell and are of utmost importance when characterizing solar cell materials. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the polymers are given in Fig. 2. The optical band gap of the polymers were estimated from the onset of absorption ( Table 3 ) because vibronic structures often yield broad low - energy absorption peaks , making it hard to distinguish absorption maxima. Estimation of optical band gap from absorption onset is also the preferred method used in scientific publications on conjugated polymers , facilitating comparisons of polymer band gap reported by different research groups. The optical band gaps ( 1.2 - 1.6 eV ) are smaller than the electrochemical band gaps , which is almost always the case when characterizing conjugated polymers. It is important to realize that there should be a difference which can be explained by the dissimilar nature of the measurements where different energy processes contribute to band gap estimation. However , results from optical absorption are in agreement with the conclusion from electrochemistry that an electron - rich comonomer gives a smaller band gap. LBPP-3 shows an absorption spectrum furthest extended to lower energies , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.2 eV , as a direct result of incorporation of the electron - rich dioctyloxy para-phenylene comonomer into the polymer backbone .",

The regioregular copolymer P1 showed a lower optical bandgap and a high degree of crystallinity compared to the random P2 copolymer. These copolymers were used as electron donors along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed bulk heterojunction solar cells. After the optimization of the weight ratio between the donor and the acceptor and the concentration of the solvent additive i.e. DIO in chloroform , the solar cells based on regioregular P1 exhibit higher power conversion efficiency ( 7.66% ) than the random P2 ( 5.33% ). The enhancement in the power conversion efficiency has been attributed to the increased hole mobility due to the high regioregularity of the conjugated copolymer backbone and effective ordering between the polymer chains. This work brings forth and establishes the importance of copolymers having a regioregular A-D-A-D structure so as to offer significant performance benefits over the random D-A copolymer.

See Throughout the last decade , polymer solar cells ( PSC ) with a bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) based on nano-composites ( polymer donor : fullerene acceptor ) have attracted significant attention as renewable energy sources due to their unique advantages , such as low cost , manufacturability , easy possibility for large - area flexible devices manufacturing , 1,2 attaining , at the same time , impressive progress in PSC effectiveness by more than 10% . [3][4][5][6] This progress has been achieved not only through better understanding and control of charge generation and transport , but also via development of a wide range of new narrow bandgap D-A conjugated copolymers 7,8 using generally the donor - acceptor ( D-A ) approach , i.e. copolymers based on alternating fragments of electron donor ( D ) and electron acceptor ( A ) units. However , common D-A copolymers have several disadvantages including the fact that common polycondensation does n't permit obtaining regioselective polymers D-A using asymmetrical monomers. It is well known , that electronic and optical properties of D-A copolymers are strongly dependent on structural order. PSC based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) with alternating regular structures exhibit higher efficiency with light absorption and charge carrier mobility improved by intermolecular π-stacking interactions in comparison with statistical P3HT where substituents are oriented randomly along the backbone chain. 9 Moreover the regioregular D-A copolymer showed a higher charge carrier mobility than its random counterpart. Recently , Lee et al. synthesized the regioregular PBDTTT-C-T copolymer which exhibited a narrower optical bandgap ( 1.55 eV ) and a higher crystallinity degree compared to the random polymer PBDTTT-C-T. Inverted PSC based on regioregular PBDTTT-C-T possessed a conversion efficiency of 7.79% , which was 19% higher than for PSC based on the random PBDTTT-C-T polymer.",

    "sentence": "10 Müllen and co-workers have also developed the random copolymer BFR1 and the corresponding regioregular BFS3 conjugated copolymer. The random BFR1 copolymer had an efficiency of 3.91% and the corresponding regioregular BFS3 polymer analogue ( as a part of polymer solar cell ) was found to have an effectiveness of 5.92% , which was 51% higher than that of the PSC based on the random BFR1 copolymer. 11 Using molecular modeling and 2D-GISAXS methods , they have proved conclusively that the intermolecular π-stacking interactions have been improved. These data were confirmed by AFM. Thus , photo - absorption improvement and charge carrier mobility increase due to high regioregularity of the conjugated polymers and efficient ordering of polymer chains are the most likely reasons for the increased PSC energy conversion efficiency. Moreover , fluorination has attracted much attention due to its multiple effects on the optical and electronic properties of resulting copolymers , i.e. the strong withdrawing ability of the fluorine atom can effectively modulate the energy levels of copolymers with minor effects on their bandgap and induce the strong dipole along the C-F bond resulting in the strong inter / intramolecular interaction which benefits exciton dissociation and charge transport. 12 Recently , Li et al. have developed a D-A structured copolymer denoted as PBDD-4ff4T with the benzodithiophene-4,8-dione acceptor and difluorinated bithiophene ( ff2T ) as the donor unit , used it as a donor along with PC71BM as the acceptor for BHJ PSC and achieved an impressive PCE of 9.2% without any extra treatment. 13 Inspired by these results , in this article , we have synthesized the regioregular copolymer P1 based on fluorine - containing 2,6-bis(7-bromo-6-fluoro-2-hexyl-2H-benzotriazol-4-yl)-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene ( M3 ) and the distannyl monomer M1 and the corresponding random D-A polymer analogue P2 based on asymmetric dibromide 2-hexyl-4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole ( M2 ). As shown in Scheme 2 , we present a step - by - step synthetic strategy based on the A-D-A intermediate , which allows obtaining regioregular polymers through the fixed orientation of the acceptor unit. To demonstrate this strategy we have chosen the monofluorinated precursor , 2-hexyl-4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole ( M2 ) , which exhibits asymmetrical reactivity between ortho-and meta-positions. The obtained random polymer based on P2 inherently possesses a structural disadvantage negatively affecting photovoltaic solar cells characteristics. Due to the fact that the acceptor monomer M2 has an asymmetric molecular structure , it is impossible to control the 2-hexyl-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole unit orientation in the conjugated polymer chain during the polycondensation reaction. So , the P2 copolymer generally has random structural regioregularity. Regioregular P1 exhibits a narrow bandgap ( E opt g = 1.75 eV ) , and a higher crystallinity degree compared with random P2. These copolymers were used as donors along with PC71BM as the acceptor for the fabrication of conventional BHJ PSC solar cells.",

    "sentence": "After the optimization of the weight ratio of the donor to the acceptor and concentration of solvent additive ( DIO ) , the PSC based regioregular P1 showed an overall PCE of 7.66% which is higher than that for the random copolymer P2 ( 5.33% ) fabricated and characterized under identical conditions . The UV - visible absorption spectra of the P1 and P2 in chloroform solutions and in thin films are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding optical data are summarized in Table 1. Both polymers showed a strong absorption peak around 600 nm ( molar extinction coefficient 3.4 × 10^5 and 2.45 × 10^5 mol^-1 cm^-1 for P1 and P2 , respectively ) originating from delocalized excitonic π-π* transitions of the conjugated polymer backbone. Interestingly , the regioregular P1 exhibited stronger absorption intensity than the random P2 which could be ascribed to vigorous π-π* transitions of the conjugated polymer chain. In dilute solutions , the main absorption band of the regioregular polymer P1 is bathochromically shifted by 15 nm and broadened to some extent in comparison to that of its random counterpart P2. This difference can be attributed to enhanced intermolecular π-π interactions resulting from the regioregular arrangement of the polymer main chain. 16 In the solid - state absorption spectra these differences were even more pronounced. It was found that the absorption spectrum of P1 in the solid thin film has a stronger shoulder peak at 641 nm than those of random P2 , indicating good intermolecular π-π* stacking of regioregular P1. This result clearly indicates that the structural regioregularity of the conjugated backbones in P1 copolymers can have a significant effect on their optical properties. The maximum absorption peak of P1 was at 592 and 578 nm for P2 with onset absorption wavelengths at 707 nm and 693 nm corresponding to optical bandgaps ( E opt g ) of 1.75 eV and 1.79 eV , respectively. The electrochemical properties of polymers were investigated to elucidate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The cyclic voltammetry characteristics of these copolymers are illustrated in Fig. 5 and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. HOMO and LUMO energy levels , electrochemical band gaps ( E ele g ) are -5.40 eV / -3.40 eV and 2.00 eV for P1 and -5.31 eV / -3.33 eV and 1.96 eV for P2 , respectively , according Fig. 3 TGA curves of polymers P1 and P2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min -1 .

    "sentence": "In order to examine the influence of the structural regioregularity of conjugated copolymer backbones on the photovoltaic performance of solar cell devices , conventional BHJ polymer solar cells were fabricated with the structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / copolymer : PC71BM / PFN / Al. The active layers were spin coated from copolymer / PC71BM solutions prepared from either the CF or 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO , 3v % )-CF mixture. First of all , we have varied the weight ratio of the copolymer to PC71BM in chloroform solution and found that the best photovoltaic response was observed for the active layers with weight ratios of 1 : 2 for both copolymers and the photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. Without DIO the devices showed PCEs of 3.87% ( J sc = 8.58 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.46 ) and 2.53% ( J sc = 6.88 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.92 V and FF = 0.40 ) for P1 and P2 , respectively. In order to improve the PCE further , we have employed the solvent additive method as reported in the literature for PSCs. 26 We are only discussing the results on the devices based on the optimized active layer , i.e. the weight ratio of the copolymer to PC71BM is 1 : 2 and the concentration of DIO is 3v % in CF. The current - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of devices based on P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM processed with DIO ( 3v % ) / CF are shown in Fig. 9a and photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. It can be seen from Fig. 9a and Table 3 that a clear improvement in PCE was observed in going from random ( P2 ) ( 5.33% ) to the regioregular ( P1 ) ( 7.66% ) copolymer. The higher value of V oc for P1 as compared to P2 is related to the deeper HOMO level of P1 as compared to P2. Moreover , compared to the PSC with random P2 , the improvement in PCE of the PSC with P1 may also result from enhanced values of J sc and FF. The IPCE spectra of the devices were investigated and shown in Fig. 9b. The IPCE spectra of the devices closely resemble the absorption spectra of the blended active layers. The response in the short wavelength region of 350-500 nm is attributed to the contribution of PC71BM. 27 The IPCE spectra in the longer wavelength region ( 500-750 nm ) correspond to the absorption of copolymers and are different for these devices. The values of IPCE for the device based on P1 are higher than that for P2 , which also supports the higher value of J sc for the former polymer than for the later one.",

It is well known that the charge carrier mobility in the active layer is very important in polymer solar cells. In order to get information about the influence of the intermolecular interactions on the hole mobility of the active layers , we have prepared the hole only and electron only devices and measured the hole and electron mobilities in the active layers based on P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM films. The measured J-V characteristics of the hole and electron only devices are shown in Fig. 10 and charge carrier mobilities are estimated by fitting these curves with the space charge limited current model. 28 The hole mobility values for P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM are 1.16 × 10^-4 and 8.04 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. The regioregular P1 showed an improved mobility compared to random P2. This may be attributed to the highly improved π-π stacking due to the structural regioregularity of conjugated copolymer backbones. 29 This is also supported by the observed red - shift and clear vibronic shoulder in the absorption spectrum of P1 in a thin film in the longer wavelength region. Moreover , XRD data also clearly indicate that the improved hole mobility of regioregular P1 due to the high regioregularity of conjugated polymer chains and effective ordering between polymer chains may be the most likely reason for enhancement of PCE. 30 The electron mobilities for P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM are about 2.56 × 10^-4 and 2.42 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. Therefore , the ratios of electron to hole mobilities are 2.19 and 3.00 , for P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM based devices , respectively , indicating more balanced charge transport in the device based on P1 : PC71BM as compared to P2 : PC71BM , leading to a higher value of FF and PCE. The nanoscale morphology of P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM thin films processed with DIO / CF solvent was investigated using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and is shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen from Fig. 11 that both the active layers processed with DIO / CF exhibit nanoscale features , indicating fine phase separation of copolymers and PC71BM with DIO additive. 31 The black domain is assigned to PC71BM aggregation because its ordered aggregation gives a relatively high electron density compared to polymer aggregation. 32 The P1 : PC71BM film has a more uniform morphology and better interpenetrating networks than the P2 : PC71BM film.",

    "sentence": "The P1 : PC71BM layer showed a finer network of bright and dark regions with appropriate nanoscale phase separation between the copolymer P1 and the PC71BM phase , which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport , resulting in improved J sc , FF and PCE. In order to get information about the charge generation in the devices based on P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM due to the different structures of copolymers , we measured the photocurrent density ( J ph ) as a function of effective voltage ( V eff ) as shown in Fig. 12. The measured J ph is defined as J ph = J L - J D , where J L and J D are the current density under illumination ( 100 mW cm^-2 ) and in the dark , respectively. V eff is given as V eff = V o - V appl , where V o is the compensation voltage at which J ph = 0 and V appl is the applied voltage. It can be seen from J ph -V eff plots that at low V eff , the J ph increases linearly with V eff and tend to saturate at higher V eff in both the devices , at which the internal electric field is large enough to dissociate all the photogenerated excitons into free charge carriers. This voltage is also responsible to sweep out all free charge carriers towards the electrodes. 33 We have observed that the J ph starts to saturate at lower V eff for P1 : PC71BM as compared to P2 : PC71BM , indicating that due to the regioregular nature of P1 with the enhanced intermolecular interactions , the low internal electric field in needed to sweep out the charge carriers in this device as compared to the P2 based device. We have estimated the probability of charge collection ( P c ) of separated carriers using P c = J sc / J phsat and the values of P c are 0.86 and 0.80 for P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM based devices , respectively. The higher value of P c for the P1 : PC71BM device is attributed to the better nanoscale morphology and balanced charge transport. We have estimated the series resistance ( R s ) and shunt resistance ( R sh ) from the slope of the J-V characteristics of the devices , under illumination , around the V oc and J sc , respectively , and compiled them in Table 3. In general , the R s of the organic solar cell is composed of the bulk resistance of the active layer and depends on the charge transportability within the active layer and the morphology of the active layer. It can be seen from Table 3 that the R s of the device based on P1 : PC71BM is lower than that for P2 : PC71BM which may be attributed to the better morphology and balanced charge transport.",

Improved photo - absorption and charge carriers mobility due to the high regioregularity of conjugated copolymers and efficient ordering of copolymer chains are most likely the cause of PSC energy conversion efficiency increasing.

Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have drawn great attentions [1][2][3][4][5] as a promising technology for renewable energy in recent years , because of their advantages of simple device structure , low cost , light weight , and easy largearea fabrication on exible substrates. The key point of the studies of PSCs is increasing the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) by developing new low band gap polymer donors , [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] new fullerene derivative acceptors [16][17][18][19] and new interface modication layers. [20][21][22] In the molecular design of polymer donor and fullerene acceptor photovoltaic materials for higher efficiency PSCs , there are several factors which should be considered , 5 including ( i ) broad absorption with high absorption coefficient in the visiblenear infrared region , ( ii ) good matching of electronic energy levels between the donor and acceptor materials , i.e. , the LUMO and HOMO of the donor should be higher than the corresponding energy levels of the acceptor by at least 0.3 - 0.5 eV for efficient charge separation at the donor - acceptor interface , and the energy difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor should be as large as possible to get higher open circuit voltage ( V oc ) ; ( iii ) high and balanced hole mobility of the donor phase and electron mobility of the acceptor phase in the active layer ; and ( iv ) capability to selfassemble into a nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the BHJ blend of the donor and acceptor to enable efficient charge separation and charge transportation. For conjugated polymer donor materials , a planar molecular structure , broad absorption , and lower HOMO energy levels are very important to meet the above mentioned requirements. Substitution by electron - withdrawing groups 6,23 and donor (D)acceptor ( A ) copolymerization [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] are efficient approaches to broaden the absorption and downward - shi of the HOMO energy levels of the conjugated polymer.",

    "sentence": "Considering the importance of the application of the new acceptor ICBA on the high efficiency D-A copolymers to further increase the V oc and PCE , it is very important to nd more D-A copolymer examples which match with ICBA , for designing high efficiency D-A copolymer donor materials . Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of PDTS - DTFBTA solution in chloroform and lm on quartz plate , together with the absorption spectrum of PDTS - DTBTA lm 31 for comparison. It can be seen that PDTS - DTFBTA demonstrates a broad absorption band both in solution and in solid lm with absorption maxima at 566 nm for the polymer solution and at 577 nm for the polymer lm. The absorption in solid state is red shied by 11 nm compared with that of the polymer solution. In comparison with the absorption spectrum of PDTS - DTBTA lm , PDTS - DTFBTA lm displayed a similar absorption spectrum , but a stronger shoulder peak at ca. 630 nm , indicating that the uorine substitution in PDTS - DTFBTA results in stronger interchain interactions in the polymer lms. The XRD pattern of PDTS - DTFBTA displayed a stronger peak at 2q = 5.34 , as shown in Fig. S2 in ESI. † The XRD diffraction peak at 2q = 5.34 corresponds to an interchain d-spacing of 16.6Å , which indicates that there is some ordered structure in the PDTS - DTFBTA lm. The absorption spectra of the blend lms of PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM and PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA with a weight ratio of 1 : 1 were compared in Fig. 1b. The absorption spectrum of the PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM lm is stronger than that of the PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA lm in the range of 350-550 nm ( see Fig. 1b ) because of the stronger absorption of PC 70 BM in this region. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the polymers and estimate its highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels. 36 Fig. 2a shows the cyclic voltammogram ( CV ) of the PDTS - DTFBTA lm on Pt disk electrode in 0.1 mol L -1 Bu 4 NPF 6 acetonitrile solution. The onset reduction potential ( 4 red ) of PDTS - DTFBTA is -1.48 V vs. Ag / Ag + , while the onset oxidation potential ( 4 ox ) is 0.43 V vs. Ag / Ag + . From the values of 4 red and 4 ox of the polymer , the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of PDTS - DTFBTA were calculated to be -3.23 and -5.14 eV , respectively , according to the equations of LUMO = -e(4 red + 4.71 ) ( eV ) and HOMO = -e(4 ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ).",

    "sentence": "36a,37 The HOMO energy level of PDTS - DTFBTA is lower than that ( -5.05 eV ) of PDTS - DTBTA due to the double uorine substitution. The electronic energy level diagrams of the two different donor and acceptor materials were displayed in Fig. 2b. The HOMO energy levels of PDTS - DTBTA and PDTS - DTFBTA are -5.05 and -5.14 eV , respectively. The lower HOMO energy level of PDTS - DTFBTA is desirable for its application as a donor in PSCs to get a higher V oc . In addition , compared to PC 70 BM , the higher LUMO energy level of ICBA could also result in a higher V oc of the PSCs because the V oc is usually proportional to the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor . The photovoltaic properties of PDTS - DTFBTA were studied by fabricating bulk heterojunction PSCs with the device conguration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PDTS - DTFBTA : acceptor / Ca / Al. Here , two different fullerene derivatives , PC 70 BM and ICBA , were used as acceptors in the PSCs. Fig. 3a shows the J-V curves of the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA and PC 70 BM under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . The PSCs with varied weight ratios ( PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM from 1 : 1 to 1 : 2 ) in the active layer were investigated , and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 1. Optimized performances were achieved with a PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM weight ratio of 1 : 1 , and the optimized devices annealed at 120 °C for 10 min show an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.64 V , a short circuit current density ( J sc ) of 9.65 mA cm^-2 , and a ll factor ( FF ) of 63.7% , giving a PCE of 3.93% . The efficiency of 3.93% is slightly improved over that ( 3.80% ) of the PSC device based on PDTS - DHBTA. 31 Increasing the PC 70 BM content to the weight ratios of 1 : 1.5 and 1 : 2 resulted in a decrease of the J sc and PCE values of the PSCs , as shown in Fig. 3a. The performance decrease could be due to the reduction of the polymer donor content , which results in the reduction of absorption and unbalanced hole - electron transportation of the active layer.",

The V oc value of the PSCs based on PDTS - DHFBTA is lower than that expected from the lower HOMO energy level of PDTS - DHFBTA which could be limited by a relatively higher carrier recombination rate at the polymerfullerene interface. 37a A similar phenomenon has been observed by Wang et. al. 37b The relatively higher concentration of the terminal end group ( structural defects ) brought about by its low molecular weight M n of 6.3 K for PDTS - DTFBTA could serve as charge carrier traps and is a possible reason for boosting the charge recombination. To further improve the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA , we tried to use ICBA instead of PC 70 BM as acceptor. ICBA possesses a higher LUMO level than PCBM , which leads to a higher V oc and PCE of the PSCs based on P3HT. 16,20 The J-V curves of the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA / ICBA are shown in Fig. 3b , and the detailed photovoltaic results are also listed in Table 1.

The increase of V oc benets from the higher LUMO energy level of ICBA , and the higher PCE resulting from the increased V oc and improved FF. Nevertheless , the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) of the PSC with ICBA as acceptor is slightly decreased from 9.65 mA cm^-2 for the PSC with PC 70 BM as acceptor to 8.69 mA cm^-2 , probably due to the weak visible absorption of ICBA than PC 70 BM and the enhanced recombination caused by the structural defects of the polymer end group.",

Aer thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min , the V oc , J sc , FF and PCE were all improved to 0.85 V , 8.69 mA cm^-2 , 67.6% and 4.99% respectively. By annealing , higher photovoltaic parameters of the PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA devices were obtained , and the PCE of the devices was improved from 2.7% to 4.99% . External quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM ( or ICBA ) are shown in Fig. 4. The PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM device showed a high photoconversion efficiency with a peak EQE value of over 60% , which agrees with the high J sc of the devices. The PSC based on PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM displayed higher EQE values than that of device based on PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA in the region of 350 to 550 nm , which could be ascribed to the stronger absorption of PC 70 BM in the wavelength region. In addition , the effect of thermal annealing on the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA was also conrmed from the EQE measurements. The EQE spectra of the device without thermal annealing showed obviously lower EQE values , which is consistent with the lower J sc of the corresponding PSCs . The morphology of the photoactive layer is also very important for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. 38 We used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to investigate the morphology of the blend lms of PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM and PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA without and with thermal treatment , as shown in Fig. 5. The lm smoothness is an important factor affecting the device performance because a smooth surface induces better contact with the electrode.

Both P1 and P2 were blended with PCBM to study the photovoltaic response of bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells. The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) levels of both P1 and P2 are well aligned with those of PCBM acceptor. This allows efficient photoinduced charge transfer and high open circuit voltage , leading to an overall power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.15% and 2.60% for the as cast P1 : PCBM - and P2 : PCBM - based devices , respectively. The PCE of the devices has been further improved up to 4.06% and 3.35% for the devices based on thermally annealed P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM blends , respectively .

From the materials perspective , these donor polymers should not only have a low band gap ( to increase the short circuit current , J sc ) but also bear a low energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) ( to improve the open circuit voltage , V oc ). 13 Typically , a low band gap polymer is designed via a \" donor - acceptor \" ( D-A ) approach , which is to incorporate electron - rich and electron - deficient moieties in the polymer backbone. The low band gap is mainly caused by the intramolecular charge transfer between donor and acceptor units. 14 In D-A copolymer , the electron unit provides a deeper HOMO level , whereas electron acceptor is used to tune the electronic bang gap. 10 In fact , several low band gap polymers have been demonstrated with decent efficiencies ( 3-6 % ) when they were blended with PCBM or [6,6]-phenyl C70 - butyric acid methyl ester ( PC70BM ) in typical BHJ devices.",

Recently , a PCE about 7.4% has been achieved from PTB7 / PC71BM solar cell devices. 40 However , the PCE of the PSCs is still low , which is mainly suffered from the narrow absorption band and the low charge carrier mobility of the π-conjugated polymers. To fabricate high - efficiency solar cells , the promising conjugated polymers should possess a broader absorption to enlarge absorption spectrum range and higher charge carrier mobility to reduce charge recombination and increase the photocurrent.

    "sentence": "The higher value of PCE for P1 : PCBM has been attributed to ( i ) the higher difference in the LUMO levels between P1 and PCBM as compared to the difference in LUMO levels of P2 and PCBM and ( ii ) the relatively higher value of the hole mobility for P1. When thermally annealed P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM active layers are used in the device , the PCE was further increased up to 4.06% and 3.35% , respectively. This enhanced PCE with thermally annealed blends has been related to the increase in both crystallinity of donor material in blend and hole mobility. On the other hand , in order to improve organic photovoltaic cells , our efforts should not be solely focused in enhancing their power conversion efficiency as it will be proved pointless without addressing their weaknesses , i.e. , poor UV - light stability and reduced lifetime. These limiting factors must be taken seriously into account as they are responsible for the loss of the electronic properties of the material used in the active layer after a very short time in use conditions. Several recent reports concerning the study of lifetime of the organic devices , during storage both in the dark 46 and under illumination , 47,48 have been published. The degradation of organic solar cells may be caused by several factors , and the photodegradation of the organic active layer is one of them. 49,50 It has been well established that the component has to be protected from the atmosphere ; 51 however , the behavior of the active layer materials under illumination and in the absence of oxygen has to be further investigated. Despite the efforts of providing an efficient protection to the solar cell against oxygen and humidity , the photodegradation of the materials can not be avoided. The direct absorption of UV - vis light by the chromophores of polymeric matrix can be responsible for photophysical processes and direct photochemical reactions. It is well - known that under the impact of light and without involvement of oxygen , [52][53][54][55] aromatic polymers for instance can undergo various reactions , involving rearrangement ( photo - Fries , Norrish y ) , chain scissions , or cross-linking. Several experiments have been conducted , involving the artificially accelerated aging of the materials. The data obtained from these experiments suggest that , if well protected of oxygen ( encapsulation ) , this active layer is photochemically stable for several years in real conditions of aging. 56 Synthesis and Characterization. Copolymer P1 was synthesized by a four - step reaction sequence which is outlined in Scheme 1. In particular , compounds 1^60 and 2^60 were synthesized according to the literature. The Heck reaction of 2 with 1,4-divinyl-2,5-bis(hexyloxy)benzene gave copolymer 3. This reaction took place in DMF utilizing Et 3 N as acid scavenger and Pd(OAc) 2 as catalyst.

Both copolymers were soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane , chloroform , and THF due to the hexyloxy side groups. P1 displayed higher solubility in these solvents than P2. The noncoplanar configuration of triphenylamine of P1 enhanced its solubility. In contrast , the two cyanovinylene 4-nitrophenyls of P2 suppressed the solubility of this copolymer. The crude products were purified by dissolution in THF and precipitation into methanol. The copolymers were obtained in 74% and 78% yield and had number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of 13^500 and 11^200 , by GPC , with a polydispersity of 2.3 and 2.1 for P1 and P2 , respectively. The FT-IR spectra of copolymers showed common absorption bands which for P1 appeared at 3030 , 1590 , 1502 , , and 962 cm^-1 ( trans vinylene bond ). Figure 1 presents typical 1H NMR spectrum of P1.

Photophysical and Electrochemical Properties. Figure 2 presents the UV - vis absorption spectra of copolymers in both dilute ( 10^-5 M ) THF solution and thin film. Table 1 summarizes the photophysical and electrochemical characteristics of copolymers. The absorption curves were broad and extended from 300 up to ∼ 750 nm in solution and ∼ 800 nm in thin film. P2 exhibited broader absorption than P1 in both solution and thin film. The copolymers displayed a short - wavelength absorption maximum ( λ a,max ) at the range of 350-400 nm. Besides , they displayed a long - wavelength λ a,max at 610-623 nm which is attributable to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the electrondonating dialkoxyphenylene and / or triphenylamine and the electron - withdrawing cyanovinylene 4-nitrophenyl. The three - dimensional configuration of triphenylamine of P1 may restrict the π-conjugation along the polymer backbone as well as the ICT. In contrast , P2 is a fully conjugated copolymer with two electron - withdrawing moieties per repeating unit which favor both π-conjugation and ICT.",

Specifically , the thin film absorption onset is located at 739 and 758 nm corresponding to E g opt of 1.68 and 1.64 eV for P1 and P2 , respectively. These E g opt values are in agreement with those of other related materials containing cyanovinylene 4-nitrophenyls which have been synthesized in our laboratory. 41,42 Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry is often used to measure the redox properties of the copolymers from which their energy levels of HOMO and LUMO are estimated. The HOMO and LUMO levels are estimated from the onset oxidation ( E onset ox ) and reduction ( E onset red ) potentials from the following expressions : 62 E HOMO = -qðE ox þ 4 : 71Þ eV E LUMO = -qðE red þ 4 : 71Þ eV The electrochemical data of both copolymers were obtained from the oxidation and reduction voltammograms as shown in Figure 3 and summarized in Table 1. The electrochemical band gap ( E g elec ) of both copolymers has also been estimated from the difference between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and listed in Table 1. The E g elec values of copolymers are slightly higher than the corresponding optical band gaps , which is probably due to the exciton binding energy of copolymers. 63 It has been generally accepted that an energy difference of 0.3 - 0.4 eV between the LUMO levels of acceptor and donor materials ( i.e. , LUMO - LUMO offset ) used in BHJ layer is necessary for efficient photoinduced electron transfer from polymer to PCBM. 64 Since the LUMO energy level of PCBM has a value ranging between -4.0 and -4.3 eV , 64 the LUMO - LUMO offset between P1 or P2 and PCBM is larger than 0.3 eV , and therefore it is expected that excitons can be easily dissociated at the interface between P1 or P2 and PCBM. Furthermore , the HOMO energy levels of P1 ( -5.2 eV ) and P2 ( -5.3 eV ) are well aligned with the HOMO level of the PEDOT : PSS ( -5.1 eV ) , indicating that holes can be easily transported from the HOMO level of P1 and P2 to PEDOT : PSS. Therefore , both copolymers can be used as electron donors with PCBM as electron acceptor for BHJ PV devices. Electrical and Photovoltaic Properties of Pristine P1 and P2. We have investigated the electrical and photovoltaic properties of single - layer devices based on P1 or P2 , before using these materials as donor component for BHJ photovoltaic devices. Figure 4a,b shows the J-V characteristics of the devices based on pristine P1 and P2 thin films sandwiched between ITO / PEDOT : PSS and Al electrodes , .

    "sentence": "Since the HOMO level of PEDOT : PSS is very close to HOMO levels of both P1 and P2 , this electrode behaves as Ohmic contact for hole injection from the PED - OT : PSS - coated ITO electrode into the HOMO of copolymer. However , the LUMO level of both copolymers is very far from the work function of Al ( -4.2 eV ) and forms the Schottky barrier for electron injection from Al into the LUMO level of copolymers. Consequently , the rectification effect is due to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the Al - copolymer layer interface. The charge mobility of the conjugated materials used as photoactive layer in organic PV device is also an important factor , which influences the short circuit current ( J sc ). The hole mobilities of both copolymers were measured using the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method 65 with the device structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / P1 or P2 / Au. The J-V characteristics of the devices were plotted as ln[Jd 3 / ( V app - V bi ) ] vs [ ( V app -V bi ) / d ] 1 / 2 ( where V appl and V bi is the applied voltage and built-in potential , respectively ) and are shown in Figure 5. The hole mobilities of P1 and P2 calculated from the intercepts of corresponding lines are 4.5 x 10^-5 and 2.1 x 10^-5 cm^2 / ( V s ) for P1 and P2 , respectively. These results indicate that both P1 and P2 behave as p - type organic semiconductor with high hole mobility and can be used as electron donor for BHJ devices. The PV parameters of the devices fabricated with P1 and P2 were estimated from the J-V characteristics under illumination , as shown in Figure 4b , and the PV parameters are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen from this table that both J sc and PCE are higher for the device based on P1 as compared to P2 under the same conditions. Since the absorption spectra and the band gap of both copolymers are almost the same , the amount of light absorbed by both copolymers will also be almost the same. This implies that the number of excitons generated in the photoactive layer is the same. Therefore , the higher hole mobility of P1 as compared to P2 , as described earlier , may be responsible for the higher J sc and PCE. The HOMO level of P1 is more aligned with the HOMO level of PEDOT : PSS , indicating that holes can be easily transported from P1 to PEDOT : PSS. However , holes can be trapped at the interface between the P2 and PEDOT : PSS due to the difference in the HOMO levels of P2 and PEDOT : PSS , which causes the slight band bending at the interface.",

Bulk Heterojunction Devices Based on P1 and P2 with PCBM. Before testing the P1 and P2 copolymers as electron donor , with PCBM as acceptor for BHJ devices , photoluminescence ( PL ) measurements were performed to examine the charge transfer efficiency from the copolymer to PCBM. Figure 6 In order to check the PV properties of copolymers P1 and P2 , we fabricated polymer solar cells with the architecture ITO / PEDOT : PSS / P1 or P2 : PCBM / Al , where both P1 and P2 were used as electron donor and PCBM as electron acceptor. The active layer constituted of a copolymer : PCBM blend at various weight ratios , and it was deposited by spincoating on an ITO glass substrate covered by a PEDOT : PSS layer. We found that the optimum copolymer : PCBM weight ratio was around 1 : 1. The J-V characteristics of the PV devices in dark and under illumination of AM 1.5 ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) are shown in Figure 7. Table 3 lists the PV parameters obtained from the J-V characteristics for the best performing devices. The devices fabricated from both copolymers clearly show a rectifying behavior in dark and exhibit significant PV effects under illumination. Our measurements ( Table 3 ) indicate that these devices have a high V oc comparable to that obtained from P3HT : PCBM device ( V oc = 0.55 - 0.60 ). The slight higher value of V oc for device with P2 : PCBM as compared to P1 : PCBM is in agreement with the value of the HOMO levels of P2 and P1 ( Table 1 ) since the V oc is related to the energy difference between the LUMO level of acceptor ( PCBM ) and the HOMO level of the donor ( copolymer ). 66 It can also be seen that the J sc and PCE of the device based on P1 is higher than that to P2. Furthermore , the device based on P1 shows an enhanced fill factor of 0.52. The improvement in J sc and PCE could be ascribed to a more efficient charge separation and transport between P1 and PCBM. Upon comparing , this result could be attributed to the higher energy difference in the LUMO levels of P1 and PCBM as compared to that between P2 and PCBM ( Table 1 ). The devices were also tested for their incident photon to current efficiency ( IPCE ).

The IPCE spectra of the devices ( Figure 8 ) show a peak which corresponds to the absorption band of the respective polymers. The similarity of the absorption spectrum with the IPCE response demonstrates that the excitons produced by the absorption of photons in copolymers are dissociated into free charge carriers in the interfaces between P1 or P2 and PCBM in the active layer and subsequently collected by the electrodes. The maximum values of IPCE for P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM based devices are about 54% and 43% , respectively. The IPCE values are consistent with the relatively higher values of J sc and PCE of the P1 : PCBM - based BHJ PV device. The photocurrent in BHJ PV device is determined by the product of the absorbed photons within the solar spectrum and incident quantum efficiency ( IQE ) of the device. 67 As it can be seen from Table 1 and Figure 2 , the optical absorption spectra and band gap of both copolymers are almost similar , indicating that the number of the photons absorbed by the active layer used in both devices is also almost the same. Therefore , the difference in photocurrent in the present devices is attributed to the difference between the IQE of the devices. The IQE is determined by three processes : ( a ) migration and diffusion of photogenerated excitons toward the D / A interface , ( b ) exciton dissociation and charge separation at the interfaces , and ( c ) collection of charge carriers by the collecting electrodes. The process \" a \" depends upon the nanoscale phase separation between the donor and acceptor materials used in the BHJ active layer. The AFM images of the P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM are similar , which indicates that both blends have the same nanoscale phase separation. For process \" b \" , a sufficient large energy difference between the LUMO of donor and acceptor material is required for ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer. As can be seen from Table 1 , this difference is higher for P1 : PCBM as compared to P2 : PCBM , resulting in higher IQE for the device based on the former blend. The process \" c \" depends upon the percolated path of electrons and holes in the BHJ active layer and also on the position of HOMO and LUMO levels of donor and acceptor materials , respectively , relative to the work function of anode and the cathode.

The J-V characteristics under illumination and IPCE spectra of the devices are shown in Figures 7 and 8 , respectively. The overall PCE for the devices based on thermally annealed P1 and P2 are 4.06% and 3.35% , respectively. The increase in the IPCE and J sc of the devices based on the thermally annealed blends is attributed to the increase in the crystallinity of the blend and the hole mobility in the copolymer phase upon thermal annealing. This can be ascribed to an effective formation of phase - separated structure induced by thermal annealing , which leads to a better connectivity of each phase. Charge carrier mobilities in donor - acceptor BHJ thin films play an important role on the performance of the organic PV devices. After the photoinduced charge transfer at the D-A interfaces presented in the bulk of the photoactive layer of the devices , the electrons are localized in the PCBM phase and holes remain in the copolymer phase , i.e. , P1 or P2 in the present cases. Subsequently , the free electrons and holes must be transported via percolated PCBM and copolymer pathways toward Al and PEDOT : PSS / ITO electrodes , respectively , in order to produce the photocurrent.

We have also investigated the morphologies of P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM blends to get information about the average surface roughness for the film , using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). The AFM images for the as-cast and thermally annealed P1 : PCBM blends are shown in Figure 9. Similar images have been also obtained for P2 : PCBM. The as-cast P1 : PCBM blend forms smooth film with an average surface roughness 1.2 nm. Upon thermal annealing of the P1 : PCBM film at 100 °C , the average surface roughness increases to ∼ 1.8 nm. It can be seen from these images that thermal annealing results in significant changes in the surface morphology. The surface domain size has also been increased upon thermal annealing. This indicates that both the increased domain size and average surface roughness result in an improvement in the crystallinity of the blend , which is responsible for the enhancement in the PCE due to the more efficient photoinduced charge at the D / A interfaces. Thin film XRD patterns were used to determine the difference in the crystallinity of the P1 : PCBM blended films ( as-cast and thermally annealed ) and are shown in Figure 10. Similar results have also been observed for P2 : CBM. It can be seen in Figure 10 that the as-cast film exhibits a peak centered at 2θ = 7.8 ° , which corresponds to the interplanar distance of 7.8 Å . The thermal annealing leads to higher peak intensity , indicating a higher degree of crystallinity. Since most of the fullerene acceptors , such as PCBM , do not show any diffraction peak in the range of 2θ values used , 68 the change in the crystallinity of the blended thin film after thermal annealing is mainly attributed to an increase in crystalline domains of the copolymer donor material. The increase in the crystalline nature of P1 : PCBM or P2 : PCBM after thermal annealing is mainly caused by the copolymer chains self - organization , into an ordered structure , as has been recently reported for P3HT : PCBM blend. The crystallization of copolymer also improves the light - harvesting property by extending the conjugation length. 69 The increase in the crystallinity of copolymer P1 or P2 in their respective blends with PCBM upon thermal annealing leads to an improvement in the hole mobility that increases the overall PCE .

An important approach in the development of p - type polymer semiconductors is the donor- acceptor ( D-A ) copolymer architecture , which by virtue of its modular nature can facilitate the tuning of absorption bands , charge carrier mobilities , and HOMO / LUMO energy levels , depending on the choice of the electron - donating ( D ) and electron - accepting segments ( A ). 23 Among recent examples of D-A copolymers found to be good p - type semiconductors for developing high performance field - effect transistors include those containing donor moieties such as thienothiophene 10a,11b and cyclopentadithiophene 3a and acceptors such as diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) , 8-11 thiazolothiazole ( TT ) , 12 and benzothiadiazole ( BTz ). 3a Further fine - tuning of the electronic structure and charge transport properties can be facilitated by the D-A copolymer architecture by the utilization of two or more different acceptor or donor units in the backbone : ( D- A 1 -D-A 2 -D ) or ( A-D 1 -A-D 2 -A ). This strategy is exemplified by copolymers incorporating both DPP and benzothiadiazole as the electron - deficient acceptor units , resulting in high mobility ambipolar charge transport in the copolymer semiconductors. 7c,e D-A copolymers incorporating DPP and oligothiophene segments have been extensively studied and found to have broad absorption bands in the UV - vis / near-IR region , low optical band gaps , enhanced π-π stacking / crystallinity , and high charge carrier mobilities.",

The new D-A conjugated polymers were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization of distannane comonomer 2 or 3 17a or 4 18a and 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2yl)-2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione ( 1 ) in the presence of Pd 2 dba 3 and P(tol) 3 as catalyst and ligand , respectively , in anhydrous chlorobenzene ( Scheme 1 ). Copolymers PDPTT and PDPTTOx were highly soluble ( 10- 15 mg / mL ) in common organic solvents such as chloroform , tetrahydrofuran , chlorobenzene , and 1,2-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. However , PDPBT which contains benzobisthiazole rings was soluble ( 8-10 mg / mL ) in chloroform at room temperature but only soluble in chlorobenzene and 1,2dichlorobenzene at high temperatures ( 60-100 ° C ). The molecular weight ( M n and M w ) and polydispersity index ( PDI = M w / M n ) of the copolymers were obtained by performing gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) relative to polystyrene standards in chlorobenzene at 60 ° C. The copolymers had moderate number - average molecular weight ( M n ) that varied from 17.0 kDa in PDPTTOx and 18.0 kDa in PDPTT to 18.5 kDa in PDPBT. The weight - average molecular weight was also comparable for the three copolymers ( M w = 59.4 - 66.6 kDa ) as was the PDI of 3.3 - 4.0. The molecular weight of these copolymers could probably be increased further by optimization of the polymerization conditions such as the monomer concentration in solution , catalyst / ligand ratio , and temperature. The thermal behavior of the thiazole-diketopyrrolopyrrole copolymers was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ). The copolymers showed onset thermal decomposition temperatures ( T d ) in the range of 378-396 ° C under N 2 , showed that there is no glass or melt transitions in this temperature range ( Figure S2 ). 3.2. Optical Properties. The normalized optical absorption spectra of copolymers PDPBT , PDPTT , and PDPTTOx in dilute chloroform solutions ( ∼ 10^-6 M ) and as thin films are shown in Figure 1. In both solutions and thin films , all the three copolymers are characterized by a broad absorption band that extends from ∼ 500 to 900-1000 nm. This absorption band appears to originate from the strong intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) interactions between the acceptor and donor moieties.",

    "sentence": "23 In dilute solution , the thiazolothiazole - linked copolymer , PDPTT , showed an absorption maximum ( λ max ) at 736 nm and vibronic shoulder at 688 nm ( Figure 1a ). The thin film absorption spectrum has a similar line shape except that the absorption maximum is at 749 nm with a vibronic shoulder at 688 nm , resulting in an absorption edge optical band gap ( E g opt ) of 1.38 eV. In solution , PDPTTOx has a broad absorption with a maximum centered at 794 nm , which red - shifts to 818 nm in thin film and results in an optical band gap of 1.22 eV. This large red - shift in the absorption maximum ( ∼ 69 nm ) of PDPTTOx compared to PDPTT films arises from the strong electron - donating nature of its octyloxy side chains. The absorption spectra of the benzobisthiazole - linked copolymer , PDPBT , in solution and as a thin film were nearly identical to those of PDPTT , showing an optical band gap ( E g opt ) of 1.33 eV ( Table 1 ). The similarity of the optical absorption spectra of PDPTT and PDPBT suggest that the intramolecular charge transfer interactions in PDPTT are not significantly altered when the secondary electron - accepting moiety is changed from thiazolothiazole to benzobisthiazole. 3.3. Redox Properties and HOMO / LUMO Energy Levels. The electronic ( HOMO / LUMO ) energy levels of the D-A copolymers were estimated from cyclic voltammetry. 25 Oxidation and reduction cyclic voltammograms ( CVs ) of the copolymers are shown in Figure 2. The onset oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) potentials are summarized in Table 1. All the copolymers showed irreversible oxidation waves as shown in Figure 2a. The onset oxidation potentials ( E ox onset ) of copolymers PDPBT , PDPTT , and PDPTTOx are 0.91 , 0.81 , and 0.74 V , respectively , from which the HOMO levels are estimated ( E HOMO = eE ox onset + 4.4 ) to be 5.31 , 5.21 , and 5.14 eV , respectively ( Table 1 ). The 0.1 - 0.2 eV lower lying HOMO energy level of PDPBT compared with the other copolymers can be understood to come from the weaker electron - accepting ability of benzobisthiazole unit. 12b,13 The observed HOMO energy levels of 5.14 - 5.31 eV suggest that hole injection into these copolymers could be optimum from high work function electrodes such as gold ( φ = 5.1 eV ). 26 The reduction waves seen in the CVs of the D-A copolymers were also irreversible as shown in Figure 2b. The onset reduction potential ( E red onset ) of the copolymers was quite similar in the range of -0.8 to -0.9 V , irrespective of whether there is thiazolothiazole or benzobisthiazole linkage in the backbone.",

    "sentence": "From this , the LUMO energy level was calculated ( E LUMO = eE red onset + 4.4 ) to be 3.50 - 3.60 eV ( Table 1 ). This value of the LUMO energy level suggests that electron injection into the copolymers may not be feasible from gold electrodes. Electron 5b or ambipolar 2b charge transport could thus be ruled out in these copolymers. The electrochemical band gap ( E g el = E ox onset -E red onset ) was found to be 1.61 - 1.83 eV , which is much larger than the observed 1.22 - 1.38 eV optical band gap. The discrepancy of 0.2 - 0.5 eV in the measured electrochemical and optical band gaps could be due to the exciton binding energy 27 of the polymer thin films. 3.4. Morphology of Copolymer Films. To provide further insight into the morphology of the copolymers , X-ray diffraction measurement was performed on drop - cast films ( from 10 mg / mL solutions in 1,2-dichlorobenzene ) deposited onto a glass substrate , annealed at 180 °C for 10 min. Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns of PDPBT , PDPTT , and PDPTTOx films. Weak diffraction peaks corresponding to a d-spacing of 2.1 and 2.5 nm due to the ( 100 ) lamellar reflections were observed for the thiazolothiazole - linked copolymers PDPTT and PDPTTOx , respectively , indicating relatively weak crystallinity in the thin films. These results reveal that there is no significant effect on morphology of the thiazolothiazolelinked copolymers , when branched ethylhexyl side chains on the thiophene rings of PDPTT were replaced by linear octyloxy side chains of PDPTTOx. On the other hand , the XRD pattern of benzobisthiazole - linked PDPBT , which has the large benzobisthiazole linkage and linear dodecyl side chains , did not show diffraction peaks , indicating that PDPBT film is far more disordered in the solid state. 3.5. Organic Field - Effect Transistors ( OFETs ). The charge transport properties of the new copolymer semiconductors were investigated by fabricating and characterizing organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) with bottom-gate and top - contact ( BGTC ) geometry and gold source / drain electrodes. Uniform films of PDPTT and PDPTTOx were easily deposited onto the OTS8 - treated , hydrophobic , SiO 2 dielectric substrate by spin - coating from a solution in a high-boiling-point solvent , 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( bp = 181 °C ). However , because of the poor wetting of PDPBT solution in 1,2-dichlorobenzene on the hydrophobic OTS8 / SiO 2 substrate , we instead used chloroform ( bp = 61 °C ) solution to fabricate PDPBT OFETs. The thickness of the polymer semiconductor layer in the OFETs was 80-100 nm. Figure 4 shows the output curves and transfer characteristics of the OFETs based on PDPTTOx , PDPTT , and PDPBT. Each of the three copolymer semiconductors exhibited unipolar p-channel field - effect transistor characteristics.",

In the case of the benzobisthiazole - linked copolymer , PDPBT , the on / off current ratio was slightly lower at 10^4 -10^5 . n-Channel operation was not observed for any of the new copolymers , and thus there is no evidence of electron transport characteristics from the given device architecture. The unipolar p - type characteristics of the presented copolymers is due to the suitable HOMO energy levels ( -5.1 to -5.3 eV ) for hole injection and transport and rather high - lying LUMO energy levels ( -3.5 to -3.6 eV ) , which presents a significant barrier for electron injection and transport. It is to be noted that some DPP - based D-A copolymer semiconductors exhibit ambipolar field - effect charge transport 5c,6b,7a,e while others exhibit unipolar p-channel fieldeffect charge transport. 8a,10a Hole mobility ( μ h ) and threshold voltage ( V t ) were calculated from the plots of square root of the drain current ( |I ds | 1 / 2 ) with respect to the gate voltage ( V gs ) in the saturation region , as shown in Figure 4b,d,f. The thiazolothiazole - linked polymers , PDPTTOx and PDPTT , have a high hole mobility of 1.2 and 0.5 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively. This carrier mobility is comparable to that of recently reported high mobility unipolar p - type polymer semiconductors. 8a PDPBT , the benzobisthiazole - linked copolymer , on the other hand , has a rather low hole mobility of 0.005 cm^2 / ( V s ). The origin of the orders of magnitude ( 100-300 × ) smaller carrier mobility in PDPBT thin films , compared to the thiazolothiazole - linked polymers PDPTT and PDPTTOx , is not obvious given the similarity in molecular weight ( Table 1 ) , molecular weight polydispersity , and HOMO-LUMO energy levels. A possible explanation of the large difference in carrier mobility between the thiazolothiazole (TT)-linked copolymers and the benzobisthiazole (BT)-linked one is the large mismatch in the size between BT and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) and thus poor solid state molecular packing and crystallinity in the case of PDPBT. The electrical parameters , including the average hole mobility ( μ h ) , the threshold voltage ( V t ) , and the on / off current ratio , of the OFETs are summarized in Table 2. One of the interesting features of PDPTTOx and PDPTT OFETs is the gate voltage ( V gs ) dependence of the hole mobility. PDPTTOx OFETs showed higher field - effect mobility of > 1 cm^2 / ( V s ) when the gate voltage is in the range of -35 to -45 V. As |V gs | further increases , the mobility decreases to 0.2 - 0.5 cm^2 / ( V s ). PDPTT OFETs also showed a similar behavior.",

Photovoltaic Properties. We investigated the photovoltaic properties of the thiazole-DPP copolymer : PC71BM blends by fabricating and characterizing bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells that have the basic device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / LiF / Al. The active layer is a spincoated film composed of thiazole-DPP copolymer : PC71BM blend with an optimal weight ratio of 1 : 2 and processed with 2.5 vol % 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) and 97.5 vol % 1,2- dichlorobenzene. The solar cells were fabricated in a glovebox and tested under AM1.5 solar illumination at 1 sun ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) in ambient air. The current density (J)-voltage ( V ) curves for the devices are shown in Figure 5a. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices , including the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) , the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , and fill factor ( FF ) , are collected in Table 3. A significant decrease in V oc of the BHJ solar cells is seen as the donor is changed from PDPBT ( 0.71 V ) to PDPTT ( 0.70 V ) and to PDPTTOx ( 0.52 V ). The decrease in V oc can be partially understood by considering the decreasing energy offset between the donor HOMO and acceptor ( LUMO ) 29 as one goes from PDPBT to PDPTTOx. In addition , the nanoscale phase - separated morphology of the donor / acceptor blend , which influences the charge photogeneration and charge carrier recombination , may also affect the observed V oc in the solar cells. 30 On the other hand , J sc shows an increasing trend , changing from 6.79 mA / cm^2 in PDPBT : PC71BM to 8.31 mA / cm^2 in PDPTTOx : PC71BM blends. This variation in J sc can in part be explained on the basis of the relative difference in the charge carrier mobilities of PDPTT , PDPTTOx , and PDPBT. Solar cells made from PDPTT : PC71BM combine a high fill factor of 0.60 with a high V oc ( 0.7 ) and moderate short - circuit current density ( 8.03 mA / cm^2 ) , resulting in a photovoltaic efficiency of 3.4% PCE. The photovoltaic efficiency of the other copolymers ( PDPBT and PDPTTOx ) was lower at 2.2 - 2.7% PCE. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectrum or action spectrum of each thiazole-DPP copolymer : PC71BM blend solar cell system is shown in Figure 5b.",

    "sentence": "The photoresponse of the photodiodes turned on at near-IR wavelengths ( 900-1000 nm ) , demonstrating light harvesting of the near-IR photons due to the small band gaps of the thiazole-DPP copolymers. The photoresponse of PDPTTOx : PC71BM blends in particular begins at ∼ 1000 nm , showing a higher EQE in the wavelength range of 800-1000 nm compared to the other copolymers in the series. This may also partly explain the observed enhanced J sc in PDPTTOx : PC71BM solar cells. The J sc calculated from the EQE spectra was 6.43 mA / cm^2 for PDPBT : PC71BM , 7.62 mA / cm^2 for PDPTT : PC71BM , and 7.68 mA / cm^2 for PDPTTOx : PC71BM. These J sc values calculated from the EQE spectra are 5-8 % lower than the J sc values obtained in direct J-V measurement due to spectral mismatch between the simulated light source and the AM1.5 solar spectrum and possibly also due to degradation of solar cells during measurement in air. We used bright - field transmission electron microscope ( BF - TEM ) imaging to investigate the nanomorphology of the thiazole-DPP copolymer : PC71BM blend thin films peeled off directly from the solar cells whose photovoltaic properties are discussed above. The images shown in Figure 6 were acquired at a slightly defocused condition to enhance the phase contrast between the polymer and fullerene , and under this focusing condition , fullerene domains appear darker than polymer domains due to the higher density of the fullerene.

Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on p - type conjugated polymers as donor 1,2 and n - type fullerene 3,4 as acceptor have been intensively studied in recent years for the generation of affordable , clean , and renewable energy. 5 Advantages of the BHJ PSCs include low - cost fabrication of large - area devices , light weight , mechanical flexibility , and easy tunability of chemical properties of the photovoltaic materials. 6 Poly(thiophene) derivatives ( PTs ) have been among the most extensively investigated conjugated polymers due to their high charge carrier mobility , strong absorption in visible region and synthetic accessibility. 7-12 Soluble poly(3-alkylthiophene)s , especially regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , are the most important semiconducting polymers for the application in PSCs. 9-12 However , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSCs based on P3HT as donor and PCBM as acceptor is limited at 4-5 % , 13,14 because of its larger band gap and its high HOMO ( the highest occupied molecular orbital ) energy level , which result in limited light absorption and a low open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the PSCs. In addition , the high regioregularityinduced crystallization may be an issue of thermal instability of the blend of P3HT and fullerene acceptors. For broadening the absorption of the PTs , the polythiophene derivatives with conjugated side chain ( CSC - PTs , where CSC represents \" conjugated side chain \" ) were designed and synthesized in our group. 15-17 The CSC - PTs possess 2-D charge transport properties thanks to the 2-D - conjugated character of the polymer structure , and broad absorptions deriving from both the main chains and conjugated side chains ; thus , this family of CSC - PTs demonstrated good device performances in PSCs 15a and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ).",

    "sentence": "16 However , due to steric hindrance of the large conjugated side chain with other alkyl side chains on the polymer main chain , the CSC - PTs showed poorer planarity , which is detrimental for the close packing of polymer chains in the solid state , as clearly evidenced for the featureless absorption along with the low absorption intensity of π-π* absorption. 15-17 As a result , this structural limitation constrains their application in organic electronics and the highest PCE value of the CSC - PTs reported so far was 3.18% . 15a To further improve the optical properties , creating the CSC - PTs without scarifying the planarity / conjugation of the thiophene backbone is very desirable. Fulfilling this goal presents serious challenges in chemistry. To address this issue , here we proposed the \" side chain isolation \" concept in designing the new CSC - PTs. We selected styryl-triphenylamine ( TPA ) as the conjugated side chain in considering the high hole mobility and good solubility of the TPA unit , and we used a tetrathiophene unit without side chains as the spacer between the thiophene units with the conjugated side chains for avoiding the steric hindrance of the side chains. In addition , two 2-ethylhexyloxyl groups were directly attached at the terminal of the TPA side chains to ensure good solubility. According to the molecular mechanics simulation ( performed with COMPASS force field within the Materials Studio Package 18 ) as shown in Figure 1 , the sidechains of PT5TPA oriented in the tail - to - tail direction are spaced approximately 13 Å apart while those side chains orientated in the head - to - tail fashions are 20 Å apart. Thus , this side chain isolation approach combines the thiophene units bearing conjugated side chain and the unsubstituted tetrathienyl spacers to reduce the steric interactions between the neighbor side chains , which lessens the torsion of the main chains ( see Figure 1b ). This CSC-PT of PT5TPA demonstrated red - shifted and enhanced π-π* transition absorption of the polymer backbone along with the shoulder peak and steep absorption edge , indicating some ordered aggregation of the polymer backbone. In addition , the polymer shows a lower HOMO energy level at -5.1 eV. The PSC based on PT5TPA as donor and indene-C 60 bisadduct ( IC 60 BA ) 4 as acceptor displayed a PCE of 3.6% with a high open circuit voltage of 0.94 V , under the illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2 .

Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure S1 in Supporting Information ( SI ) , demonstrated a good thermal stability of the polymer with a 5% weight - loss temperature at 354 ° C. DSC was measured in the temperature range of 30-280 ° C , but we did not find the glass transition temperature in the temperature range. ( see Figure S2 in Supporting Information ). Optical and Electrochemical Properties. Figure 2a shows the absorption spectra of PT5TPA solution in chloroform and film on quartz plate , together with the absorption spectrum of PT2TPA film 16a ( PT2TPA is a PT5TPA-analogue polymer with only one thiophene spacer , named as OTPAV-PT in ref 16a ). The solution and film absorption of PT5TPA display similar broad absorption band from 300 to 650 nm with three distinct absorption peaks. The two weak absorption peaks around 303 and 413 nm originate respectively from n-π* transition of TPA group 22 and the absorption of the thiophene units with the conjugated side chain , while the maximum absorption of the copolymer at 555 nm corresponds to the π-π* transition of the polymer backbone. Thus , both the main chain and side chain contribute to the broad nature of the absorption spectra of the polymer , which is a common feature for PTs with conjugated side chains. 15,16 Because of an enlarged π-system , the film absorption of PT5TPA is red - shifted by ca. 10 nm than that of P3HT. The absorption edge of the polymer film is at 658 nm , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.88 eV. The similarity of solution absorption to film absorption suggests strong π-π interactions ( aggregation ) in solution. As shown in Figure 2a , when the polymer solution was heated to 85 °C , the absorption peaks blue shift , and the shoulder peak at ca. 600 nm weakened , reflecting partial disaggregation of the polymer backbone at high temperature. Also it must mention that the obtained high molecular weight of PT5TPA could be overestimated due to the easily formed polymer aggregation state at room temperature. In comparison with the absorption spectrum of PT2TPA film 16a as also shown in Figure 2a , the π-π* absorption of PT5TPA main chains at ca. 500-650 nm is greatly enhanced than that of the CSC - PTs with concentrated side chains. 15-17 Obviously , the side chain isolated PT5TPA can minimize the steric interactions between the neighboring side chains , thus preserving backbone planarity , which results in the red - shifted and enhanced π-π* transition of the polymer backbone along with the shoulder peak and steep absorption edge.",

    "sentence": "Furthermore , the well - defined spectra of PT5TPA imply an ordered polymer chains and densely packed side chains in the polymer film , which should benefit to higher hole mobility and photovoltaic performance of the polymer. In order to further investigate the ordered structure of the polymer , we measured X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) of the polymer film on Si substrate. The XRD pattern of the polymer film ( see Figure S7 in Supporting Information ) indicates that the polymer film is still in amorphous state although the aggregation is enhanced in the polymer. The hole mobility of PT5TPA film was measured to be 1.1 × 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) by space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method ( see Figure S3 in Supporting Information ) , confirming the relatively higher hole mobility of the polymer. Figure 2b shows the photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of PT5TPA solution in dichlorobenzene and film , excited at 430 nm , which is the maximum absorption wavelength of the conjugated side chains of the polymer. PT5TPA shows deep red main chain emission peaked at 670 nm. The results indicate that quick and complete energy transfer occurs from the conjugated side chains to the polymer main chains after the conjugated side chains absorb the photons. This phenomenon ensures that all photons absorbed by the polymer are useful for the photovoltaic conversion. The electronic energy levels of the conjugated polymers can be measured from the onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials of the cyclic voltammograms ( CVs ). 23 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram of PT5TPA together with that of P3HT for comparison and that of ferrocene for potential calibration. The redox potential of ferrocene is 0.09 V vs Ag / Ag + . On the basis of 4.8 eV below vacuum for the energy level of Fc / Fc + , the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the unit of E ox onset is V vs. Ag / Ag + . The onset oxidation potential ( E ox onset ) and onset reduction potential ( E red onset ) of PT5TPA are 0.39 and -1.63 V vs. Ag / Ag + respectively , accordingly , the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PT5TPA were calculated to be -5.10 and -3.08 eV respectively. Compared to that of P3HT , the onset oxidation potential of PT5TPA is positively shifted by ca. 0.2 V and the HOMO energy level of PT5TPA is downward shifted by ca. 0.2 eV , which is due to less alkyl substituents of PT5TPA than that of P3HT. 12b The lower HOMO energy level relative to P3HT can provide better air stability in ambient conditions and higher open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the PSCs with PT5TPA as donor materials because the V oc is usually proportional to the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor. 6 Photovoltaic Properties.",

The two copolymers exhibit lower - lying HOMO energy level and closer interchains packing than their analogue with alkyl side chains attributed to the more polarizable S atom inducing stronger intermolecular interactions. Of these two polymers , PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 with linear alkylthio side chains shows closer molecules stacking with PC71BM than PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH with branched akylthio side chains. As a result , the polymer solar cell based on the blend of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 and PC71BM got a higher PCE of 8.51% than that based on PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PC71BM , which was only 7.02% . More importantly , both two copolymers shown higher photovoltaic performances in as-casting devices than in which treated by additive or thermal annealing because an appropriate bulk morphology was formed during process of the spin - casting due to strong interchain interactions of the polymers , which eliminates the need of solvent additives or thermal annealing . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted increasing attention due to their potential advantages of low cost , light weight , capability to be fabricated into flexible devices and easily realize roll - to - roll manufacturing. Nowadays , owing to development on molecule designing , device fabricating and principle studying , the power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of PSCs have been well improved. The single - junction bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs have achieved PCEs over 10% [1][2][3][4][5]. In many reported BHJ PSCs , post solvent and thermal annealing are important methods for improving the organic solar cells ( OSCs ) performance. But the residual solvent additives in the BHJ films will act as hole traps [6]. And additives , such as 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) , will significantly reduce the device stability [7][8][9]. Therefore , devices after using additives should be treated by a secondary process to remove the additives [7,8]. However , considering manufacturing challenges for future commercialization of solar cells , it is necessary to remove extra processes such as adding solvent additives and thermal annealing so that facilitating the processing and reducing the cost of production. Thus , designing and synthesizing novel polymer materials that exhibited high solar cell performance using simpler processing methods are highly desired. In designing molecule , a widely used strategy is to construct electron donor - acceptor ( D-A ) type of alternating copolymers with narrow bandgaps. Through the combination of different electron donor ( D ) units and acceptor ( A ) units , the energy levels , absorption spectra and many other characteristics of the copolymers can be easily tuned. In addition , introduction of different side chains into the copolymers can further adjust precisely the physical characters of copolymers such as solubility , light absorption , molecular packing , energy level , charge transport , etc. Up to now , flexible alkyl groups are widely used side chains in tuning the basic properties of the copolymers.",

    "sentence": "The polymers with branched alkyl side chain generally exhibit higher solubility while the polymers analogues with linear alkyl side chains show closer intermolecule packing and higher charge mobilities [10][11][12][13][14]. Also , recent studies demonstrated that alkylthio side chains offer prominent advantages over their alkyl analogues. This is due to the sulfur atom with higher polarizability than carbon atom and form p π (C)-d π ( S ) orbital overlap where divalent sulfur atom accepts π-electron from the aromatic group into its empty 3d-orbitals [15,16]. In that case , conjugated molecules substituted by alkylthio groups could exhibit unique optoelectronic properties. For example , Huoet al. [17] replaced the alkyl side chains of the poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) with alkylthio side chains , and the resultant poly[ (3hexylthio)thiophene ] ( P3HST ) exhibited the red - shifted max absorption peak and slightly lower the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , therefore resulting a higher open - circuit voltage ( V oc ). Li et al. [18] and Price et al. [19] found that the alkylthio side chain of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b ' ]dithiophene ( BDT ) unit enhanced V oc and PCE of the relative device compared to its alkyl analogue , although the HOMO level almost unchanged. Also , in the works of Chen et al. [20,21] , the HOMO and max absorption peak of oligomers showed little changes and V oc was not improved by introducing the alkythio side chains , but both short - circuit current density ( J sc ) and PCE increased because of a better morphology. The most exciting results for alkylthio groups were achieved when they are linked to the conjugated side chains of copolymers. For example , Li et al. [16] introduced branched alkylthio substituents into the conjugated side chains of BDT unit , and a high PCE of 8.42% was achieved for the device based on the resulting copolymer PBDTT-S-TT which is associated with its low - lying HOMO and extended absorption spectra. Based on the same copolymer , Ye et al. [22] synthesized a copolymer PBDT - TS1 by replacing branched alkylthio side chains with linear ones , and PCE of the relative device was further improved to 9.48% . These reports indicated that using alkylthio groups to replace alkyl side chains of the polymers would improve photovoltaic performance , though the conclusion about the effects of the alkylthio side chains on HOMO level , J sc and V oc obtained in those literatures were a little different. In addition , Yang , et al. [23,24] found that some low-E g D-A type of polymers , such as PBDTT - DPP , PDPP3T , and PDTP - DFBT , usually do not require DIO to achieve moderate cell performance , because these polymers can form a good nanoscalebicontinuous phase separation with PC71BM spontaneously.",

    "sentence": "It is generally believed that these low-E g polymers possess a stronger interchain interaction , thus appropriate bulk BHJ morphology can be formed during the spin - casting or perhaps as early as in solution state , which allows these polymers to achieve high device performance without having to use post-solvent and thermal annealing steps. This indicates that adjusting the interchain interaction to increase aggregation propensity of the polymers would be an effective strategy to get rid of additives or thermal annealing steps. Following this design concept , Yang et al. [25] recently synthesized a polymer PBDTSe-TT through selenium substitution on the PTB7 - polymer. PBDTSe-TT possesses enhanced π-π interaction between molecules brought by selenium atom , therefore achieved high performance of 8.8% PCE without any additives. In the same time , Yue , et al.

[27] reported thieno [3,2b] [1]benzothiopheneisoindigo based polymers also demonstrated the same cell behaviors as PBDTSe-TT because of their strong intermolecular interaction. Our group has been working toward developing new D-A conjugated photovoltaic polymers. Very recently , we reported a series of D-A copolymers based on alkylthienyl BDT donor unit and difluorinatedquinoxaline ( Qx ) acceptor unit , and found that PBDT-DFQX-TT ( whose molecular structure is depicted in Scheme 1 ) demonstrated the best photovoltaic performance [28]. More interestingly , those Qx - based polymers all exhibited better performances for additive - and annealing - free devices than which treated by solvent additives and thermal annealing. On the basis of those previous findings , here , we propose that if the alkyl side chains on PBDT-DFQX-TT can be replaced by alkylthio side chains to further enhance the interchain interaction , the corresponding polymers might demonstrate improved performance for additive - and annealing - free devices. Therefore , with the intention to further improve the photovoltaic properties , as well as to investigate the effects of alkylthio side chains on the properties of the copolymers , we designed and synthesized two new polymers PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 ( shown in Scheme 1 , compared with the formerly reported PBDT-DFQX-TT in ref. 28 ) , by replacing alkyl side chains with branched or linear alkylthio side chains on the thienyl BDT units of the PBDT-DFQX-TT. The results showed that the two copolymers exhibit lower - lying HOMO energy level and closer interchains packing than PBDT-DFQX-TT attributed to the more polarizable S atom inducing stronger intermolecular interactions. The BHJ PSC based on PBDT-DFQx-TTSEH achieves high performance of 8.51% PCE without solvent additives or thermal annealing , whereas the highest PCE of PBDT-DFQx-TTSC8 device is 7.02% .

These results demonstrate that introducing alkylthio substituents to enhance intermolecular interactions could be an effective strategy for developing new polymers with high - performance for additive - and annealing - free devices.

The molecular weights of the copolymers were measured by GPC in trichlorobenzene eluent at 150 °C using polystyrene standards.

Well defined vibronic shoulder absorption peaks in the long wavelength range ( 600-700 nm ) of both polymers implied the existence of ordered aggregation and strong π-π stacking [16]. The peak at around 590 nm can be assigned as 0-1 vibronic transition and around 640 nm as 0-0. The dominant 0-0 vibronic peak is indicative of extended J-aggregate - like polymer chains that pack in ordered lamellae , whereas the 0-1 is of H-aggregatelike. H-aggregate - like polymer has a side - by - side arrangement of chains while the J-aggregate - like polymer is head - to - tail arrangement. PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TT have stronger 0-0 peaks indicated that the two polymers tend to form J-aggregate arrangement whereas PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 has a stronger 0-1 peak and tends to form H-aggregate arrangement. In generally , polymers tend to be an Haggregate - like arrangement are beneficial for intermolecular charge mobility. The polymer possesses H-aggregate - like interchain packing would perform better charge mobilities , J sc and PCEs for its devices [32][33][34]. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to measure the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the conjugated polymers. The measured cyclic voltammograms and energy level diagrams are illustrated in Figure S3 and Figure S4 , and the results are summarized in Table 1. The onset potentials for oxidation ( E ox ) of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 are 0.76 and 0.67 V vs. Ag / Ag+ , respectively. The onset potentials for reduction ( E red ) are -1.25 and -1.24 V vs. Ag / Ag + , respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the copolymers were calculated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential according to following eqn. ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : E HOMO = -e(E ox +4.71)(eV) ( 1 ) E LUMO = -e(E red +4.71)(eV) ( 2 ) The LUMO energy levels of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 are -3.46 and -3.47 eV , respectively.

Up - shifted LUMO and decreased HOMO of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 led to wider band - gaps than PBDT-DFQX-TT. These indicated that the alkylthio chains significantly influence the electronic properties of the 2Dconjugated polymers. And the down - shifted HOMO energy levels are in according with the literatures [16,22] and these would be favorable for acquiring PSCs with high V oc .",

The molecular main chain length was n = 1. The alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups to save computation time. The simplified molecules were referred as In addition , we noted that the HOMO energy level of PBDT-DFQX-TTS simulated by the DFT calculation seems significantly higher ( by ~ 0.5 eV ) than the experimental observation. The reason for such a deviation is that we adopted a monomer model ( the number of repeat units is one ) for simplifying DFT calculation. But for the CV measurements , the experimental observation represented the real results of the whole polymer .

As a result , PCEs of the devices for PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 were 7.02 and 8.51% , respectively. Especially , the J sc of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 device showed a more remarkable higher than PBDT-DFQX-TT and PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH , rendering the devices rather higher PCEs. Further treatment of adding 3% ( v / v ) 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) as additive into the solution for device fabrication caused J sc values of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 obviously increased but that of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH reduced. Especially , DIO treatment resulted in V oc s , FFs dramatic decrease of the two devices , therefore the PCEs was compromised by low V oc s , FFs. Relating to the AFM and GIXS results , the drop in the performance can be attributed to that the DIO further promoted the PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 and PC71BM self - aggregation , therefore forming larger impropre phased domain and unfavorable blend film morphology. In addition , thermal annealing ( TA ) treatment on the devices alsofailed to improve the performance. The PCEs of the two devices were slightly decreased after 140 °C 10 min thermal annealing ( TA ) treating.",

The Rms values of two polymers were enhanced by treating with DIO which is attributed to that DIO treatment can promote the phase separation and self - aggregation , making the polymers to form bigger domain size [41]. Generally , smaller domain size can provide larger area of D / A interface and get more efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation.

Correlatively , the π-π stacking distance were 3.63 and 3.41Å respectively , which were both closer than 3.79Å of PBDT-DFQX-TT ( Ref. 28 ). Closer π-π stacking distances are attributed to the higher interchain interaction , which can improve the inter-molecular exciton transfer and it should be a reason to get higher photovoltaic performance.

However , the device based on J76 : PC71BM demonstrated a higher PCE of 4.33% with a J sc of 9.73 mA cm^-2 , a FF of 49.33% , and a slightly lower V oc of 0.90 V due to the up - shifted HOMO level of J76. After using 0.5% CN solvent additive , the PCEs of the three PC71BM - based devices are dramatically increased to 6.79% , 7.71% and 8.37% for the PSCs with J71 , J75 and J76 as donor , respectively. We can clearly see from Table 2 and Table S1 that the increased PCEs of the three devices after using solvent additive come from the increase of J sc and FF. The higher J sc values of the devices with 0.5% CN solvent additive treatment can be confirmed from their IPCE spectra ( see Figure 2b ) , and the IPCE spectra agree well with the change in absorption of the donors. Selenophene substitution on π bridges of J76 caused absorption band red - shifted by ca. 25 nm , leading to the higher J sc value of the J76 - based PSCs than the J71 and J75 - based PSCs. The maximum IPCE values reached 75% , 80% , and 79% for the PSCs based on J71 , J75 , and J76 , respectively , which together with the enhanced FF Article indicate efficient charge dissociation and transportation in the active layers after using 0.5% CN solvent additive. The integrated J sc values of the PSCs from the IPCE spectra agree well with the J sc values measured from J-V curves within a 5% mismatch. The new polymer of J76 with red - shifted absorption increased the efficiency in blend with PC71BM. Nevertheless , the efficiencies of fullerene - based PSCs were limited mainly by the relatively narrow absorption of the fullerene acceptor. We further fabricated the nonfullerene PSCs with n-OS m-ITIC as acceptor , for further investigating photovoltaic performance of the polymer donors. Figure 2c shows the J-V curves of the PSCs and Table 2 listed the photovoltaic performance data of the devices with m-ITIC as acceptor. Obviously , the nonfullerene PSCs with m-ITIC as acceptor demonstrated significantly improved photovoltaic performance. The PCEs reached 11.73% , 11.41% , and 11.04% for the PSCs based on J71 , J75 , and J76 respectively.",

The results indicate that the selenophene substitution on the π bridges of the polymers redshifted their absorption and increased PCE of the fullerenebased PSCs , nevertheless , it has weak influence on the photovoltaic performance of the nonfullerene PSCs. In addition , we also synthesized the copolymer J77 by copolymerization of M2 and M4 ( both the selenophene substitution on side chain and π-bridge ). The J77 : PC71BMbased devices show the PCE of 4.34% and 7.97 with or without 0.5% CN additive , and the PSCs based on J77 : m-ITIC demonstrated the PCE of 10.54% , see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. The photovoltaic performance of the polymer donor J77 is similar to that of J75 and J76. So , we mainly discussed the photovoltaic performance of polymer J75 and J76. We used the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method to study the charge mobilities ( see Figure S7a,b ). We can clearly see that electron mobilities with using 0.5% CN are higher than that without using solvent additive ( see Table S3 and Table S4 in the Supporting Information ) , while the hole mobilities were similar and without evident changes. The hole ( μ h ) / electron ( μ e ) mobility ratio of the three devices with using 0.5% CN additive treatment are 2.1 , 1.9 , and 1.2 for the PSCs based on J71 , J75 , and J76 blended with PC71BM , respectively. The more - balanced mobility for the devices with CN additive treatment are beneficial for electron / hole transportation , which should be one of the reasons for their higher J sc and FF than that of the devices without using solvent additive treatment. We also measured the charge carrier mobilities of the m-ITIC based PSCs by SCLC method ( see Figure S7c ). Both electron and hole mobility of J71 - based PSCs is higher than that of the PSCs based on J75 and J76 ( see Table S5 in the Supporting Information ). The hole ( μ e ) / electron ( μ h ) mobility ratio of the three devices are 1.92 , 2.24 , and 3.00 for the J71 , J75 , and J76 - based PSCs ( see Table S5 in the Supporting Information ) , respectively. The higher electron and hole mobility and more - balanced mobility of the J71 - based PSCs could be one reason for its higher J sc , thus better photovoltaic performance. Morphology Analysis. Photovoltaic performance of the conjugated polymer donor materials is tightly related to their morphology in the active layer blended with the acceptors.",

The GIWAXS patterns of neat acceptor films and blend films of the polymers with PC71BM without CN are also shown in Figure S8 for a clear comparison. The π-π stacking distance and coherence length data are listed in Table S6 in the Supporting Information. The donors and m-ITIC show preferred face-on molecular packing orientation relative to the substrate. The π-π stacking distance of J71 , J75 and J76 is 3.83 , 3.85 , and 3.83 Å , respectively , indicating that replacing thiophene by selenophene on the conjugated side chain of BDT unit or π bridges has little influence on the π-π stacking distance. The corresponding coherence length of neat films is calculated ( via the Scherrer equation ) to be 2.5 , 2.5 , and 2.7 nm , respectively. Coherence length of J76 is slightly higher compared to other two polymers. It can be seen from Table S6 that J76 in its blend film with PC71BM with and without CN additive has slightly larger coherence length than that of J71 , which are beneficial for the charge transport thus achieve higher FF and J sc ; nevertheless , the π-π stacking distances are around the similar values for all the blend films.

The RSoXs data exhibits only one correlation distribution ( only smaller size domains ) after processing with CN additive. RSoXs can also reveal the rootmean - square standard deviation of the composition distribution : 47,48 The higher the total scattering intensity , the purer the average domains.",

    "sentence": "Due to the asymmetric nature of the phase diagram in polymer : small molecule blends , the small moleculerich phase is likely very pure and the scattering intensity tracks in a monotonic way the concentration of the small molecule in the polymer - rich phase. From the scattering intensity , we infer that the CN additive treatment leads to relatively higher domain purity ( see Figure S9a,b,c ) and that J76 : PC71BM blend with CN additive treatment gives higher relative domain purity than in the J71 : PC71BM and J75 : PC71BM blend films. Compared with the blend films without CN treatment , the small phase separation and higher relative domain purity observed in the blend films with CN treatment are beneficial for charge separation and transport , leading to higher J sc and FF. It is necessary to note that the absorption of J76 is redshifted by ca. 25 nm in comparison to that of J71 and J75 , which also leads to higher J sc values of the PSCs based on J76 : PC71BM. Combining RSoXs with GIWAXS data , J76 blended with PC71BM has larger coherence length , proper phase separation , and higher relative domain purity , thus achieving the higher FF and PCE. In the m-ITIC system , the approximate average domain size of J71 , J75 , and J76 in the blend films with m-ITIC is 30 , 33 , and 46 nm , respectively ( see Figure S9d and Table S6 in the Supporting Information ). It is accepted that the optimal domain size for PSCs is about 20- 30 nm ; 49 the slightly large domain size of J76 : m-ITIC blend film diminishes the excitons effective separation , which reduces the J sc and PCE of the PSCs. The morphology of the blend films was further studied using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) measurements. In the PC71BM system , the blend films based on J71 , J75 , and J76 without CN additive show the surface morphology with a root-mean-square ( RMS ) roughness of 1.40 , 1.32 , and 1.43 nm , respectively ( see Figure S10a-c ). The TEM images of these blend films show obviously large phase - separation in bulk , which results in lower J sc ( see Figure S10d-f ). After using 0.5% CN solvent additive , the blend films show a much smoother surface with RMS roughness of 0.58 , 0.55 , and 0.86 nm , respectively ( see Figure 4a We synthesized two new copolymers J75 and J76 by selenophene substitution of thiophene on the conjugated side chains of BDT or π bridges of the D-A copolymer J71 based on alkylsilyl-BDT donor unit and bifluorobenzotriazole acceptor unit with thiophene π bridges.

Compared with the counterpart , P(BT-DPP) , which contains no end - caps , P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn showed remarkably enhancement of light absorption in the range of ca. 400-550 nm resulted from the end - capping effect of porphyrins. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on these polymers were fabricated and the results showed significant improvement of power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of the endcapped polymers. Especially , ligand addivie , 4,4′-bipyridine ( Bipy ) , was applied to the PSCs based on polymers end - capped by porphyrins and the PCE of the photovoltaic device based on P(BT-DPP)-QPZn significantly improved from 2.92% to 4.45% with the comprehensive benefits of optimization strategies such as using additives and thermal annealing. Furthermore , thermal aging experiments showed increased stability of the optimal morphology of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM blend film after the use of Bipy. This study provides a promising strategy to design donor - acceptor copolymers with multifunctional end - caps and to use ligand additives for achieving PSCs with both high - efficiency and long - term stability , which are critical for the devices to be commercially useful . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have emerged as promising alternatives to inorganic photovoltaic devices due to their potential advantages of low cost , lightweight , and capability to be fabricated into flexible devices. 1 Although the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs has been rapidly improved from below 1% to over 10% in the past decades , 2 there are still many improvements that need to make before wide scale manufacture of PSCs. One of the most effective strategies to improve PCEs is molecular structure engineering of conjugated polymers , for example , rational design of conjugated polymers backbones , side chain engineering , and substituents. 3 The design rules for high efficiency photovoltaic polymers are much complicated because many factors that influence the photovoltaic performance should be simultaneously considered to meet with all the requirements , such as light absorption , energy levels , charge mobility , solubility , morphology , and phase separation. 4 On one hand , the conjugated polymers for photovoltaic materials are generally strong rigid , which implies limited solubility in organic solvent. The widely used strategy to solve this problem for the sake of solution - processing is to introduce flexible side chains to the polymers. With the increase of the bulk of flexible side chains , polymers tend to be easily soluble. But this strategy brings another problem , that is , bulky side chains would inevitably decrease the concentration of polymer chromophores , which would further decrease the light absorption of polymers. Therefore , when introducing side chains to polymers , one should consider the balance between sufficient solubility and strong light absorption ability.",

The absorption features of P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn indicated that the end - caps of QP and QPZn units enhanced the absorption of relevant polymers in the short wavelength region. Hence , the increased usage of photons may be anticipated to increase the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) of the photovoltaic devices. Furthermore , all the absorption peaks of the polymers in films showed red - shifts compared with those in solution because of the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. Also , the obvious broadened and enhanced absorption in films indicated the formation of efficient intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) effect in the polymer chains. Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was used to study the electrochemical properties of the polymers. Figure 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films. The onset oxidation potential ( E ox ) of P(BT-DPP) , P(BT-DPP)-T , P(BT-DPP)-QP , and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn are -1.16 , -1.19 , -1.21 , and -1.21 V vs Ag / Ag + , respectively , while the onset reduction potential ( E red ) of the polymers are 0.46 , 0.51 , 0.47 , and 0.47 V vs Ag / Ag + , as shown in Figure 5 and Table 2.

Here , the HOMO energy levels of the polymers are primarily dominated by BT units , and the LUMO energy levels of the polymers are primarily dominated by DPP units. The very slight difference ( within ± 0.05 eV ) in the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these polymers indicates that the end - caps do not significantly influence the overall energy levels of the polymers. Similar results were found in other polymers end - capped by various end - caps. 6b The speculated reason for the slight effect of endcaps on the electrochemical properties of the polymers is that the end - caps only appear in two terminals of polymer chains which occupy too little portions to determine the overall energy levels of the polymers. The proper location of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers would provide both sufficient open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the PSCs and driving force for charge separation and transfer between polymer and PC71BM.",

Photoactive layers were prepared by spin - coating the mixtures of polymers and PC71BM from chloroform solutions. In order to optimize the device performances , the weight ratio of polymers to PC71BM was carefully tuned. Figure 6a shows the current density - voltage characteristics of the PSCs based on polymer : PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2 and representative data are summarized in Table 3. P(BT-DPP) without end - caps showed a low PCE of 1.48% with a low J sc of 3.65 mA / cm^2 , while polymers with endcaps showed different photovoltaic properties according to different end - capping units. P(BT-DPP)-T with end - capping unit of T showed a slight higher PCE than P(BT-DPP) , mainly because of the decreased structural defects resulted from the end - capping unit , which would hamper undesired degradation of device performance. 7 P(BT-DPP)-QP with end - capping unit of QP showed the highest PCE of 3.33% with the highest J sc of 8.25 mA / cm^2 among these four polymers , which was ascribed to the enhancement of absorption of P(BT-DPP)-QP in the wavelength range of 400-550 nm caused by the end - capping unit of QP. However , P(BT-DPP)-QPZn with end - capping unit of QPZn showed a slightly lower PCE than P(BT-DPP)-QP , which may be due to the limited enhancement of absorption of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn. For further optimizing the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn , additives and thermal annealing were applied to the fabrication of photovoltaic devices. Figure 6b shows the current density- voltage characteristics of the PSCs based on P(BT-DPP)-QP:PC71BM and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM under different optimized conditions. 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) was reported to be an efficient solvent additive to improve the performance of PSCs based on DPP - containing polymers. 23 Here , we also added DIO as an additive into the blend solution of polymer and PC71BM to optimize the performance of photovoltaic devices. It can be noted that the use of DIO did improve the performance of devices based on both P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn , which was quite consistent with the influence of solvent additives on photovoltaic performance based on the principle of different solubility toward donor and acceptor materials. In our previous study , we reported that the coordination effect between ligand additive , 4,4′-bipyridine ( Bipy ) , and polymers containing metalloporphyrin facilitates the optimization of film morphology and device performance.",

    "sentence": "10 Here , on the basis of using DIO solvent additive , we also added Bipy ligand additive into the blend solution of photoactive materials. The effect of additives combined with thermal annealing on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn was investigated. The results showed that the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on P(BT-DPP)-QP slightly decreased after adding Bipy. No obvious difference in photovoltaic performance was observed after further thermal annealing. The slightly decreased PCE may be explained by disturbed packing of polymer chains caused by extra Bipy , resulting in a slight decrease of J sc . In contrast , after adding Bipy into the PSC based on P(BT-DPP)-QPZn , the device showed a remarkably improved PCE from 3.48% to 4.16% with a largely enhancement of J sc to 10.38 mA / cm^2. After thermal annealing , the PCE of photovoltaic device based on P(BT-DPP)-QPZn further improved to 4.45% with a high J sc of 11.99 mA / cm^2. The largely enhancement of J sc may be ascribed to the optimized morphology of the photoactive layer resulted from the coordination effect between Bipy and the end - capping unit of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn. Intriguingly , it should be noted that V oc was also largely enhanced after adding Bipy into P(BT-DPP)-QPZn - based PSCs. Actually , this is not the first example of enhancing V oc by using Bipy additive. In our previous study on effect of Bipy additive on PSCs fabricated from quinoxalinoporphyrinatozinc - based polymer , the enhancement of V oc was also apparent. 10 Since the exact mechanism is not very clear , here , we can only speculate that Zn-N interactions between the end - caps of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn and Bipy additive played a great role in the enhancement probably by causing the recovery of V oc loss , which was similar to the effect of N-N interactions observed between N - containing polymer and N - containing interlayer on the performance of PSCs. 4c , 24 To further investigate the effect of ligand additive Bipy on the photovoltaic devices , some simple thermal aging experiments were employed to devices based on P(BT-DPP)-QPZn. After thermal aging at 110 °C for 1 h , the PSC processed with only DIO showed a PCE of 2.12% , which retained only 61% of its initial PCE. However , the PSC processed with both DIO and Bipy showed a PCE of 3.36% , which retained 76% of PCE. We suppose that the use of Bipy would stabilize the photoactive layer , leading to the decreased degradation in the condition of device aging. The results showed much similarity to the increased stability of optimal morphology caused by crosslinkable additives. 25 Figure 7 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) characteristics of the devices fabricated under optimized conditions. Broad EQE responses ranging from 300 to 900 nm were observed in all the devices.",

    "sentence": "After thermal annealing was applied to the blend film , the R a raised to 3.35 nm and more distinct fibrous interpenetrating networks were observed with the feature size of ca. 20 nm , which facilitated to the further increase of J sc of PSC. 27 Surface morphology with rough , uniform , and bicontinuous nanoscaled interpenetrating networks is a signature of high - efficiency solar cells. 28 In addition , a red shift of the Soret band in the light absorption of the metalloporphyrin - containing polymer was observed after using Bipy as ligand additive , 10 which was a sign of the formation of coordinative complex. Herein , we measured the UV - vis absorption spectra of the P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM blend film before and after using Bipy. As shown in Figure S18 , although no obvious red shifts were observed in the Soret band , an absorption shoulder of 720 nm of the absorption spectra was observed instead , which could be used as an indicator of the H-aggregation of DPP - based polymers. 29 After using Bipy , the absorption shoulder of 720 nm showed a slight enhancement , indicating the increase of side - by - side arrangement of chains ascribed to the coordination between Bipy and QPZn. After thermal annealing was applied to the blended film processed with Bipy , the shoulder did not change significantly , indicating that the coordination was relatively stable . In conclusion , a series of end - capped donor - acceptor copolymers with T , QP , and QPZn as end - caps were synthesized and well characterized. Especially , P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn end - capped by porphyrins showed remarkably enhancement of light absorption in the short wavelength region. Bulk heterojunction PSCs based on these polymers were fabricated and the end - capped polymers showed significantly improved PCEs compared with the counterpart without end - caps. In addition , ligand addivie , Bipy , was applied to the photovoltaic devices based on P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn. The PCE of the photovoltaic device based on P(BT-DPP)-QPZn showed significantly improvement from 2.92% to 4.45% with the integrated optimization stratragies of using additives and thermal annealing. Furthermore , benefiting from the coordination effect between Bipy and QPZn , the blend film of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM and the corresponding photovoltaic device showed increased stability after using Bipy as additive. This work provides a new insight into designing donor - acceptor copolymers with multifunctional end - caps and exploring promising optimization stratragies of using ligand additives to achieve PSCs with both high - efficiency and long - term stability , which are critical for the devices to be commercially useful. c]pyrrole ( DPP ) were synthesized following modified procedures. 9,30 2,2′-Bithiophene-5,5′-bis(trimethylstannane) ( BT ) was prepared according to the reported procedure. 19 Other reagents and solvents were commercial grade and used without further purification unless otherwise stated .",

PTTBTz film possesses high thermal stability with 5% weight - loss temperature at 450 °C , a lower - lying HOMO energy level at -5.20 eV , a higher hole mobility of 6.45 × 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) , and a crystalline structure. Photovoltaic performance of the polymer was investigated with [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) or indene-C 60 bisadduct ( ICBA ) as acceptor and with 3% DIO additive. The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSC based on PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 w / w ) reached 5.35% with a high V oc of 1.03 V , a J sc of 8.55 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.608 , whereas the PCE of the PSC based on PTTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) was 4.57% with a V oc of 0.82 V , a J sc of 9.89 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.563 , under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2. PTTBTz is one of the D-A copolymers that shows better photovoltaic performance with ICBA as acceptor than PC 70 BM. PTTBTz / ICBA could be a promising front active layer for high - efficiency tandem PSC because of its high V oc . In recent years , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted considerable attention because of their advantages of low cost , easy fabrication , lightweight , and capability to be fabricated into flexible large - area devices. 1-5 Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure utilizing a conjugated polymer as donor and fullerene derivatives [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 60 BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) as acceptor now plays a leading role in realizing high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSCs. The key issue in the studies of PSCs is to increase the PCE of the devices. The factors that determine the PCE of the PSCs are the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , and fill factor ( FF ). V oc is proportional to the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of the donor. 6 Therefore , lower HOMO of the donor and higher LUMO of the acceptor will lead to higher V oc of the PSCs. The J sc is tightly related to the absorption and charge carrier mobility of the photovoltaic materials , and FF is influenced by the charge carrier mobility of the photoactive layer.",

For the donor unit in the D-A copolymers , thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( TT ) unit has a rigid and coplanar fused ring and ensures a highly extended π-electron system and strong π stacking. Therefore , TT unit has attracted much interest in the construction of high - performance organic / polymer semiconductors for the applications in optoelectronic devices. 22-27 The field - effect hole mobility of a conjugated polymer containing TT unit in the polymer main chain reached as high as 1.95 cm^2 / V s. 27 The PSCs based on a D-A copolymer with TT as donor unit exhibited a high PCE over 5% . 26,27 In this work , we designed and synthesized a new D-A copolymer based on BTz and TT units , poly(thieno[3,2b]thiophene-alt-bithiazole) ( PTTBTz ).

PCE of the PSC based on PTTBTz as donor and ICBA as acceptor reached 5.35% with a high V oc of 1.03 V , under the illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2. The results are very important for understanding the applicability of the new acceptor ICBA for the D-A copolymer photovoltaic donor materials to get higher V oc and further improved efficiency . 3.1. Synthesis and Thermal Properties. PTTBTz was synthesized by Stille coupling reaction using Pd ( PPh 3 ) 4 as the catalyst. The polymer has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , toluene , chlorobenzene , odichorobenzene , and so on. The number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of PTTBTz is 6.73 K with a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 1.60. Thermal stability of the polymer was investigated with TGA. The TGA result ( see Figure 1a ) reveals that the onset temperatures with 5% weight - loss ( T d ) of PTTBTz is 450 ° C. This indicates that the thermal stability of PTTBTz is very good for the application in optoelectronic devices. To investigate possible crystallization in the copolymer films , the differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) was measured , as shown in Figure 1b. There is an apparent exothermic peak at 115 °C for PTTBTz indicating that there is some local crystallization in the polymer films. 3.2. X-ray Diffraction. To investigate further the crystalline property of PTTBTz , we measured the grazing - incidence XRD pattern of the polymer film , as shown in Figure 2. The XRD pattern of the pristine polymer film exhibits three diffraction peaks at 2θ = 6.45 , 13.63 , and 21.96 ° , respectively. The ( 100 ) and ( 200 ) diffraction peaks for PTTBTz are at 6.45 and 13.63 ° , respectively , indicating an ordered structure along with a d spacing of 13.68 Å that can be ascribed to the interchain distance separated by the alkyl side chains. The interchain d spacing of 13.68 Å is smaller than that ( ca. 16 Å ) 33 of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , which indicates more densely packed side chains in PTTBTz than in P3HT. The broad feature at 21.96 ° , corresponding to a distance of 4.02 Å , can be assigned to the facial π-π stacking between polymer backbones. The results indicate that PTTBTz possesses ordered polymer chains and densely packed side chains , which should be beneficial to higher hole mobility and better photovoltaic performance of the polymer. 3.3.

The absorption maximum of the polymer film appeared at 532 nm ; a significant red shift of 61 nm relative to that in solution , indicating that considerably strong intermolecular interactions existed in the solid film. Additionally , a vibronic shoulder at 573 nm implies an ordered arrangement of PTTBTz in the solid film , with strong π-π stacking between the polymeric backbones , a feature that also appears in regioregular P3HT. The optical bandgap of PTTBTz , estimated from the onset wavelength ( ca. 660 nm ) of main absorption band of the polymer film , was 1.89 eV , which is similar to that of P3HT ( 1.91 eV ). 34 3.4. Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical CV was performed for determining the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers. 35 As shown in the CV of PTTBTz ( see Figure 4 ) , the onset reduction potential ( φ red ) is -1.81 V versus Ag / Ag + , and the onset oxidation potential ( φ ox ) is 0.49 V versus Ag / Ag + .

Actually , the thermal annealing on the PSCs in the temperature range from 80 to 120 °C for 10 min influenced the photovoltaic performance very little or decreased the photovoltaic performance a little , as shown in Figures S1 and S2 and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information. In addition , it deserves to notice that although the new acceptor ICBA improves the photovoltaic performance of P3HT greatly , only very few D-A copolymers 32 show better photovoltaic performance with the acceptor of ICBA than PCBM ( PC 60 BM or PC 70 BM ).

    "sentence": "If the D-A copolymer is amorphous , when it is blended with PCBM the nanoscaled interpenetration network could be formed due to the crystalline aggregation of PCBM , but if the amorphous polymer is blended with the amorphous ICBA , then it will be difficult for the separate aggregation of the donor and acceptor to form the nanoscaled interpenetrating network. ( 2 ) The LUMO energy level ( -3.74 eV 28 ) of ICBA is ca. 0.17 eV up - shifted from that of PCBM ; if the LUMO energy level of the D-A copolymer is low , the smaller LUMO energy level difference between the D-A copolymer donor and the ICBA acceptor will decrease the efficiency of the exciton dissociation on the interface of the donor and acceptor , so that it decreases J sc and PCE of the PSCs. The success of the D-A copolymer PTTBTz here with ICBA acceptor could be benefitted from its crystalline structure and relatively higherlying LUMO energy levels ( -2.90 eV as mentioned above ). Anyway , we need more knowledge and polymer examples for understanding what kind of D-A copolymers will show further improved photovoltaic performance with ICBA as acceptor than PCBM. Probably , we also need to look for new solvent additive to improve the interpenetrating network morphology of the blend films of the D-A copolymers and ICBA in the PSCs. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the PSCs based on PTTBTz : acceptors ( 1 : 1 w / w ) with and without DIO additive is shown in Figure 6. The maximum EQE values of the PSC with PC 70 BM and ICBA as acceptor were 46 and 39% respectively without using DIO additive , and it increased to 73 and 68% , respectively , with 3% DIO additive. The EQE results agree well with the J sc of the corresponding PSCs mentioned above. 3.6. Hole Mobility. Hole mobility is an important parameter for the conjugated polymer donor photovoltaic materials. Here we measured the hole mobility of PTTBTz by space - charge limited current ( SCLC ) method by using a holeonly device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer / Au. For the hole - only devices , SCLC is described by 38 εε μ ≅ J V VEL L ( 9 / 8 ) exp(0.89 / ) / 0^0 2^0 3 ( 1 ) where ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer , ε 0 is the permittivity of the vacuum , μ 0 is the zero - field mobility , E 0 is the characteristic field , J is the current density , L is the thickness of the blended films layer , V = V appl - V bi , V appl is the applied potential , and V bi is the built-in potential that results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode ( in this device structure , V bi = 0.2 V ).",

    "sentence": "Figure 7 shows the ln(JL 3 / V 2 ) versus ( V / L ) 0.5 plot for the hole mobility measure - ment of PTTBTz. According to eq 1 , the hole mobility of PTTBTz was calculated to be 6.45 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . 3.7. Morphology. To understand the effect of 3% DIO additive , we investigated the morphology of the blend films by AFM ( as shown in Figure 8 ). It can be seen that with 3% DIO treatment the blend film demonstrated more uniform structure and better interpenetrating network than that of the film without DIO treatment. Two features are observed from the comparison : ( i ) From the height images , the surface processed with DIO is significantly rougher than that without using the solvent additive , with root-mean-square surface roughness of 8.5 nm for the PTTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 ) film with DIO additive ( Figure 8c ) compared with 3.3 nm for the PTTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 ) film without DIO ( Figure 8a ) or 20.4 nm for the PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 ) film with DIO additive ( Figure 8g ) compared with 5.1 nm for the PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 ) film without DIO ( Figure 8e ). Islands and valleys are apparent after adding DIO. It has been reported that a rough surface is a \" signature \" of high - efficiency PSCs in the treatment of both \" thermal annealing \" 39 and \" solvent annealing \" . 40 ( ii ) From the phase images , in the films with the additive , ordered crystalline domains of polymer are clearly visible , but they are absent in the films without the additive. This suggests that ordered chain alignment is achieved when using DIO as solvent additive. As a result , the device performance was greatly improved. These results proved that morphology control by using additive is an effective way to improve the performance of PSCs. For further confirming the ordered structure induced by the DIO additive , we measured the absorption spectra of the blend films of PTTBTz : PC 70 BM and PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 w / w ) with or without DIO additive , as shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. It can be seen that the absorbance of the blend films with DIO additive is more enhanced than that without DIO additive , which is consistent with the improved ordered structure of the blend films by DIO additive. Actually , AFM can only probe the surface of active layer. To probe further the morphology throughout the entire film , TEM was used to obtain a real - space image of the phase - separated morphology of the polymer - fullerene blends with or without 3% DIO , as shown in Figure 9.",

    "sentence": "The most pronounced feature of the films with DIO additive compared with that without DIO ( Figure 9b,d,f,h ) is the appearance of dark clusters in the film and high contrast of these clusters to the background. These clusters are reminiscent of TEM images by Yang et al. , 41 in which PC 70 BM - rich domains were developed during the annealing step. Similar to Yang 's work , the dark regions in Figure 9a are attributed as PC 70 BM clusters. Obviously , the DIO additive helped the formation of appropriate aggregation of the fullerene acceptors , which is beneficial to the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. Our results agree with the literature reports that DIO helps to increase the fullerene domain sizes and morphology of the blend films processed with additives showed larger scaled phase separation than that of the blend film without additive. 42-44 We synthesized a new D-A copolymer ( PTTBTz ) containing thienothiophene donor unit and bithiazole acceptor unit , by the Pd - catalyzed Stille - coupling method , for the application as donor materials in PSCs. PTTBTz film shows a similar absorption band and a higher hole mobility of 6.45 × 10^-3 cm^2 / V s as that of P3HT , but with ca. 0.3 eV lower - lying HOMO energy level at -5.20 eV. The photovoltaic performance of the polymer was improved significantly by using DIO additive and using ICBA as acceptor. The PCE of the PSC based on PTTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) reached 4.57% with J sc = 9.89 mA / cm^2 , V oc = 0.82 V , and FF = 0.563 , and the PSC based on PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 w / w ) demonstrated a higher PCE of 5.35% with a high V oc of 1.03 V , a J sc of 8.55 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.608 , under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2. These results indicate that PTTBTz is a promising donor material for the application in tandem PSCs , and the new acceptor ICBA could also be used as an efficiency acceptor in the PSCs based on crystalline D-A copolymer donors. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information I-V curves and photovoltaic performances of the PSCs based on PTTBTz : ICBA and PTTBTz : PC 70 BM and absorption spectra of blend films.

    "sentence": "Fused - ring units as building blocks have been used to develop highly efficient D-A copolymers for bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells due to their unique advantages , such as extended conjugation length , reduced bandgap , enhanced light - absorbance , stronger interchain interaction , and high charge carrier mobility. 1 Replacing thiophene with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( TT ) is an effective approach to develop new fused - ring units ( Fig. 1 ). 2 TT can promote polymer packing and improve charge carrier mobility. 2a Durrant et al. reported a new donor unit dithienogermolodithiophene ( DTTG ) , in which two TT units are connected through a dialkylgermanium unit. pDTTG-TPD:PC71BM solar cells exhibit efficiencies up to 7.2% . 2b Hou et al. developed a two - dimensional donor unit DTBDT and its copolymer PDT-S-T gives a higher PCE ( 7.79% ) than polymer PBDTTT-S-T ( 5.93% ). 2c Jen and Cheng independently reported new heptacyclic ladder - type donor unit IDTT via replacing terminal thiophenes of IDT with TT. IDTT building block endows D-A copolymers with extended conjugation length , better lightharvesting capability , enhanced charge mobilities and better photovoltaic performance. 2a,2d In addition , TT can also be used as a π-bridge , which used to be thiophene , furan or selenophene. 3 The above mentioned approach is rarely used to develop new fused - ring acceptor units as far as we know. Recently , we have developed a series of lactam acceptor units and their copolymers show good photovoltaic performance. 4 PThTPTI consisting of thieno [ 2',3' : 5,6]pyrido [3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione ( TPTI ) and thiophene afforded efficiencies up to 9.20% . 4b In this work , two thiophenes at the end of TPTI were replaced by TT to produce a new heptacyclic acceptor unit thieno [ 2'',3'' : 4',5']thieno[2',3' : 5,6]pyrido [3,4g]thieno [ 2',3' : 4,5]thieno [3,2-c]isoquinoline-1,8(2H,9H)-dione ( TTP , Fig. 1 ). The centrosymmetric TTP contains seven fused aromatic rings with two TTs , one benzene , and two pyridones. D-A copolymer PBDTTTP was synthesized by copolymerizing TTP with benzo [1,2b:4,5-b']dithiophene ( BDT ). PBDTTTP possesses a deep HOMO level and an optical bandgap of 2.11 eV. PBDTTTP : PC71BM solar cells gave a PCE of 5.53% , which is higher than that of its analogue PBDTTPTI. 3 kDa with a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 4.00 , estimated by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using THF as eluent. As determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) ( Fig. S3 ) , the decomposition temperature ( T d ) of PBDTTTP is 329 °C , suggesting its good thermal stability for photovoltaic application. The optical properties of PBDTTTP were studied by UV - vis absorption spectroscopy. PBDTTTP solution and thin film show similar absorption spectra with two peaks ( Fig. 2 ). The strongest absorption peaks locate at 553 and 556 nm , and the second peaks at 512 and 514 nm , respectively. From solution to solid state , the red shift is ~ 3 nm.

    "sentence": "The optical bandgap for PBDTTTP is 2.11 eV , which is larger than that of pentacyclic TPTI analogue PBDTTPTI ( 2.03 eV ). 5 From TPTI to TTP , the conjugation system was extended , while the absorption spectrum shows a blue shift. The aromatic feature for the copolymer might get stronger when extending TPTI unit to TTP unit. 6,7 X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) pattern of pure polymer film is shown in Fig. 3. The two peaks at 4.62º and 24.25º correspond to an interlayer d-spacing of 19.11 Å and a π-π stacking d-spacing of 3.67 Å , respectively. The peak at 4.62º indicates that PBDTTTP is partially crystalline , which is necessary for high hole mobility. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) of polymer thin film was measured ( Fig. S4 ). PBDTTTP has an oxidation onset potential ( E ox on ) of 0.63 V and a reduction onset potential ( E red on ) of -2.20 V , and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are determined to be -5.43 eV and -2.60 eV , respectively.

Along with the morphological optimization of the active layer made of blends of p - type polymers : n - type fullerenes , over 7-8 % of power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) in single - junction BHJ PSCs have been realized. 2,3 Moreover , interfacial layer modifications 4 and novel device architectures promoted the PCEs of multiple - junction BHJ PSCs to over 9-10 % . 5 Modulation of the molecular energy levels of the D-A copolymers via replacing the chalcogenophene ( CP ) π-bridges ( i.e. , furan-2,5-diyl ( -Fu- ) , thiophene-2,5-diyl ( -Th- ) and seleno-phene-2,5-diyl ( -Se- ) groups ) have been widely adopted because of the ready availability of the CP units and their significant influences on the molecular properties. In general , copolymers using -Fu-π-bridges have better solubility , 6 lowerlying highest occupied molecular orbital level ( E HOMO ) , and deliver higher open circuit voltage ( V oc ) than their counterparts. 7 Those employing -Se-π-bridges generally possess more quinoidal character , stabilized E LUMO and narrower E g . 8,9 Consequently , higher charge mobility ( μ ) in organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) and short - circuit current ( J sc ) in BHJ PSCs were delivered by the devices utilizing the -Secopolymers. 10 P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) in Scheme 1a is one of the poly(5,6-difluorobenzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole-4,7-diyl-alt-quaterchalcogenophene) ( P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) ) copolymers. It has high crystallinity in the solid - state , delivers high hole mobility ( μ h ) in organic fieldeffect transistors ( OFETs ) and has 6.8% power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) in BHJ PSCs. 11 However , due to the relatively large E g of P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) , the PCE of the P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) : PC71BM PSCs was limited by the low J sc . In attempts to improve the performances of the P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) , and to investigate the influences of the -Se-π-bridges on the P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) copolymer , in this study , a novel P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) copolymer , P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) , was synthesized. Replacing the -Thwith the -Se-π-bridges effectively narrows the E g to 1.56 eV , and results in high J sc of the P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) : PC71BM PSCs. The P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) : PC71BM PSCs delivered a J sc of 15.8 mA cm^-2 , and the best PCE of 7.34% .",

The process additive , 1-chloronaphthalene , was used to optimize the active layer morphology. The significant changes in the molecular and morphological behaviors caused by the -Se-π-bridges were further scrutinized by morphological analyses and theoretical calculations. It was found that the larger atomic size of selenium improves the backbone linearity , which enhances the aggregation strength and solid - state order of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ). Synthesis of monomers and polymers The synthetic route to P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) is depicted in Scheme 1b. A Pd - catalyzed Stille - coupling reaction between 5,6-difluoro-4,7-diiodobenzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole ( 1 ) and 2-(tributylstannyl)selenophene afforded the formation of 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(selenophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole ( SeFBT ) in a 89% yield. Lithiation of the SeFBT by lithium diisopropylamide ( LDA ) followed by reacting with trimethyltin chloride resulted in the formation of 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)selenophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole ( Sn-SeFBT ) in 57% yield. Sn-SeFBT was then copolymerized with 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene by Stillecoupling to give P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ).

The absorption spectra for the P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) in o-dichlorobenzne ( ODCB ) solution and thin film are shown in Fig. 1. In the solution , the absorption bands with λ max s at 430 nm and at 662 nm are attributed to the localized π-π* transition and the photo - induced intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) band of the copolymer. The optical band - gaps ( E g ) deduced from the absorption edges of the thin film spectrum is 1.56 eV. Compared to P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) , 11 P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) exhibited more bathochromic absorption of the ICT band in solution and in the solid state due to the selenophenes introducing more quinoidal character to conjugated polymer backbones. 8d,9 Deduced from cyclic voltammetry measurements ( Fig. S1 † ) , the E HOMO and E LUMO of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) are -5.39 eV and -3.70 eV , respectively. Compared to the E HOMO and E LUMO of P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) , 11 the smaller E g of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) is a result of the elevation of E HOMO as shown in Fig. S1b. † The result is unexpected , because in the previous cases , 8a,d,e the narrower E g of the -Seanalogues was a result of the deeper - lying E LUMO s instead of the raised E HOMO s.

The melting temperatures ( T m ) of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) was not found below 350 °C in the differential scanning calorimetry measurement. Because wide angle X-ray diffraction ( WAXD ) study ( vide infra ) confirms that P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) is in its crystalline state at room temperature , the T m of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) should be above 350 °C , which is higher than the T m of P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) ( 270 °C ).

The distance matches the d-spacing of the π-π stacking , and further confirmed the dark regions as the polymer - rich domains. The results indicated that P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) tends to segregate into large domains in the active layer. To decrease the degree of segregation , 1-CN was used as an additive. With 8 vol % of 1-CN , the population of large dark spots decreased as shown in Fig. 5c. A more homogeneous morphology , which contains interpenetrating polymer - rich ( darker regions ) , and polymer - deficient ( brighter regions ) , was obtained.

Partially due to their donor - acceptor repeating structure , the new polymers show lower band gaps in comparison to that of the most studied P3HT , 26 which can lead to better absorption of solar irradiation. OFETs fabricated from P3 achieved a hole mobility ( μ h ) of 8.9 x 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) and current modulation ( I on / I off ) of 10^5 . Photovoltaic properties of the new polymers were investigated by fabricating BHJ devices using these polymers as donor and PC71BM as acceptor. An average power conversion efficiency of 3.06% was achieved for P3 with a high V oc of ∼ 0.8 V. Because of promising charge transport properties of pure P3 film and the relatively high V oc of P3 / PC71BM cells , we believe the device performance of polymer P3 analogues can be further improved by optimizing the side chains of P3 as well as device fabrication conditions. While we were preparing this report other groups have recently obtained highly efficient solar cells ( 4.2 - 6.8% PCE ) [47][48][49][50] from a D-A copolymer with TPD as acceptor and benzodithiophene as donor. The current study adds to this body of work by revealing the effects of combining other donors and substituents with the highly promising TPD acceptor . Polymer molecular weight is an important factor that can affect the device performance of OFETs 53 and solar cells. 54 The electron - deficient TPD monomers are ideal coupling partner with electron - rich distannylated thiophene monomers , leading to high number - average molecular weights from 32 kDa for P1 to 55 kDa for P2 and to 64 kDa for P3 , and the high isolated yields indicate excellent conversion. Resolved 1H NMR spectra of polymers P1-P3 ( Supporting Information , Figures S1-S3 ) could be obtained only at elevated temperature ( 130 °C ) due to aggregation. However , no 13 °C signals arising from polymer backbones could be observed even after 12 h collection at 130 ° C.",

    "sentence": "Compared to our previously reported phthalimide analogue PhBT12 having identical side chains and a molecular weight of 207.5 kDa , 39 P1 has about 1 order of magnitude lower molecular weight , which could be due to its relatively low solubility , resulting in termination of polymerization at an earlier stage. The lower molecular weight and the poor processability of P1 can be the factors which affect the film morphology and limit the carrier mobility in OFET devices. 53 Replacing the n-dodecyl TPD substituent in P1 with 2-butyloctyl in P2 imparts better solubility and processability. Despite the fused - ring structure of cyclopentadithiophene ( CDT ) , copolymer P3 shows decent solubility which can be ascribed to the out - of - plane orientation of the alkyl chains on the CDT unit. Polymers P2 and P3 can be dissolved at higher concentrations at lower temperature than P1 in chlorinated solvents. Optical Properties. Absorption spectra were recorded from chlorobenzene solution ( 1 x 10^-5 M ) and thin films ( Figure 2 ) , and the related data are collected in Table 1. The absorption maxima are 675 , 680 , and 688 nm for as-cast films of P1 , P2 , and P3 , respectively. The thin films of these polymers exhibit both an absorption maximum and a shoulder , which are similar to the vibronic structures seen in regioregular polythiophene spectra. 55 From solution to thin film , no significant differences were observed in the absorption spectra for all three polymers , which indicate some degree of rigid chain conformation and / or aggregation 56,57 in solution at room temperature. In molecularly dissolved solutions , absorption spectra are usually broad and featureless , reflecting random thermal population of rotational states. Thermochromism of P1 solutions ( Figure 2 ; for P2 and P3 , see Figures S5 and S6 ) is manifested by blue shifts in the absorption profile with increasing temperature. From room temperature to 100 °C , the absorption maximum of P1 solution was blue - shifted by 25 nm from 748 to 723 nm. This could correspond to increased torsional activity or changes in aggregation number. The optical band gaps of polymer films calculated from absorption edges are 1.50 , 1.50 , and 1.67 eV for P1 , P2 , and P3 , respectively , which are much smaller than the optical band gap of P3HT ( ∼ 1.90 eV ) , 58 due to their donor - acceptor makeup. 59 As predicted , the band gap of P1 is smaller than that of the analogous phthalimide polymer PhBT12 ( 1.64 eV ) with the same donor unit. 39 The 0.17 eV narrower band gap of P1 and P2 compared to that of P3 is ascribed to the stronger electron - donating capability of dialkoxybithiophene units relative to cyclopentadithiophene units. Although potentially enhancing absorption of solar energy due to decreased band gap , these stronger donors destabilize HOMO energy levels which can limit V oc in PSCs ( vide infra ).

    "sentence": "The high - lying HOMO of P1 ( -4.85 eV ) is due to the electron - rich character of the dialkoxybithiophene units. Interestingly , although polymers P1 and P2 have the same backbone structure and the same optical band gap , the onset of oxidation for P2 is 0.2 V more positive. This effect might be attributed to changes in solid - state ordering , e.g. , backbone torsion or π-contacts. A similar change of HOMO levels was also observed in other TPD - based polymer semiconductors , when n-octyl chains were replaced with branched 3,7-dimethyloctyl chains. 49 The calculated HOMO energy is -5.26 eV for P3 , which is about 0.2 eV deeper than that of P2 and 0.4 eV deeper than P1. The low - lying HOMO of P3 is due to the synergetic interaction between the weak Field - Effect Transistors. Thin films of P1-P3 with a thickness of 30-50 nm were deposited onto octyltrichlorosilane (OTS8)-modified silicon / silicon dioxide substrates to evaluate charge transport properties of these polymers. 36,39 All devices were fabricated by employing the bottom-gate bottom - contact configuration , and all the polymers showed typical hole - transport properties ( Figure S10 ). Unlike P1 and P2 , a superlinear increase was seen in the output curves of P3 ( Figure S10 ). This is likely caused by contact resistance between gold electrodes ( work function ∼ 5.1 eV ) and the deeper HOMO level of P3 ( -5.26 eV ). Among the new polymers , P3 showed the highest average hole mobility of 8.9 x 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) with an I on / I off ratio greater than 10^5 ( Figure 3 ). P1 and P2 exhibited hole mobilities of 7.2 x 10^-4 and 2.0 x 10^-4 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively ( Table 2 and Figure S11 ) , which are an order of magnitude lower than that of P3. Thermal annealing at temperatures between 110 and 200 °C did not have a significant effect on the OFET characteristics of the polymers ( Table 2 and Figure S11 ). The independence of the carrier mobility on annealing temperature is also expected as we were unable to detect any thermal transitions by DSC within the range of the study ( 110-200 ° C ) ( Figure S4 ). More or less subtle changes were noted in room - temperature thin - film UV / vis absorption spectra after annealing at 180 °C for 30 min ( Figure S12 ). The low - energy shoulders in the spectra for P1 and P2 become more pronounced after annealing , while for P3 , fine structure actually decreases. Film microstructures and surface morphology were investigated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). It is interesting to compare the X-ray diffraction patterns of films of P1 and our previously reported phthalimide - based analogue PhBT12.",

    "sentence": "39 The film of PhBT12 shows intermediate and wide - angle diffraction maxima , indicating lamellar ordering and close π-stacking distance of 3.6 Å , while the diffractogram from P1 is essentially featureless. In fact , all the TPD - based polymers ( thin films on glass ) reported here do not give rise to any observable Bragg reflections ( Figure 4 ) when using a θ-2θ geometry. Furthermore , the AFM images ( Figure 5 ) of polymer films on the transistor surfaces are featureless with rms roughness lower than 1 nm ; no terrace - like structures or nanofibrillar morphology was detected , which are frequently seen in highly ordered polymer semiconductors. 39,61,62 Though it will require further studies ( e.g. , grazing - incidence X-ray diffraction , GIXD ) to confirm , the replacement of benzene in phthalimide - based PhBT12 with thiophene in P1 may actually severely curtail long - range solid - state order , contrary to our predictions. This could account for the more than 2 orders of magnitude lower mobility of P1 than that of PhBT12. Although XRD and AFM suggest amorphous microstructures for polymer P3 , a moderate field - effect mobility was achieved for this material. The amorphous character of the polymer can be beneficial for the reproducibility of device performance during the device fabrication. 63 Photovoltaic Devices. Photovoltaic properties of P1 , P2 , and P3 were evaluated after fabricating bulk heterojunction solar cells using fullerene derivative PC71BM as acceptor. Two sets of solar cells with polymer / PC71BM composition of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 ( wt : wt ) were fabricated. The films have a thickness of 80-90 nm , and all the solar cells have an active area of 9 mm 2 . The device size used in this study is much larger than our previously reported PhBT12 solar cells ( 4 mm 2 ) 40 to minimize overestimation of the photovoltaic performance and for more consistent comparison among different laboratories. The current density - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the solar cells measured under dark and 100 mW / cm^2 AM1.5 simulated sunlight and the absorption spectra of the blend films measured from the solar cells are shown in Figure 6. The photovoltaic parameters of the solar cells are summarized in Table 3. The short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and the fill factor ( FF ) observed in 1 : 1 P1 : PC71BM solar cells are 3.56 mA / cm^2 , 0.45 V , and 0.49 , respectively , resulting in an average power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 0.78% . When the composition of P1 : PC71BM increased to 1 : 2 , the PCE was improved to 1.44% with the J sc greatly increased to 7.39 mA / cm^2 and the V oc and FF slightly decreased to 0.41 V and 0.48 , respectively.",

    "sentence": "It is obvious that the more than doubled J sc accounts for the efficiency improvement in the 1 : 2 solar cells. Comparison of the absorption profiles of the pure polymer and the blends suggests that the enhanced current density in the 1 : 2 blends could in part be due to increased light absorption at wavelengths below 620 nm , but nanoscale morphology changes may play a more important role. The higher loading of fullerene in the 1 : 2 solar cells may lead to formation of mixed polymer / fullerene phases together with more continuous fullerene pathways for electron transport. 64 Solar cells based b , d ). The absorption spectra were measured directly from the devices using ITO / PEDOT : PSS substrate as a reference. on polymer P2 show poor photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency of only 0.57% and 0.50% for 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 P2 : PC71BM composition. We note that different from P1 ( and P3 ) all the solar cell parameters in P2 devices are almost independent of the blend composition. The best photovoltaic performance was achieved in P3 solar cells. The average PCE achieved in the 1 : 1 P3 : PC71BM solar cells was 1.76% with the J sc , V oc , and FF of 5.76 mA / cm^2 , 0.79 V , and 0.39 , respectively. When the ratio of P3 : PC71BM changed to 1 : 2 , the average PCE was improved to 3.06% . The peak efficiency achieved in P3 : PC71BM ( 1 : 2 ) solar cells was 3.15% with J sc , V oc , and FF of 8.29 mA / cm^2 , 0.76 V , and 0.50 , respectively. Different from P1 solar cells , in which increasing fullerene loading only led to improved J sc , both J sc and FF were greatly enhanced in 1 : 2 P3 : PC71BM solar cells relative to 1 : 1 P3 : PC71BM solar cells ( Table 3 ) , indicating more balanced charge transport in the 1 : 2 composition. The observed very different photovoltaic properties of P1 , P2 , and P3 , as seen in Figure 6 and Table 3 , come from the variation in J sc ; the highest J sc was achieved in P3 solar cells and the lowest in P2 solar cells. It is obvious that the difference in the J sc can not be merely explained by the different absorption intensity as all the blend films have very similar absorption spectra and intensity ( Figure 6d ). The hole mobility of the polymers is one of the reasons for the variation in J sc ; the highest photocurrent density was observed in highest hole mobility P3 - based solar cells. However , the hole mobility itself can not explain the very low J sc of P2 solar cells since the hole mobilities of P2 and P1 are of the same order of magnitude.",

Separated toroid - shaped domains with micrometer sizes can be clearly seen in the P2 : PC71BM ( 1 : 2 ) film , indicating reduced interfacial area for exciton dissociation and a lack of effective percolation for charge transport in the blend film. 65 This means only charges dissociated near the electrodes can be collected , which explains the very low and composition - independent photocurrent density. In contrast , nanoscale phase separation is observed in both P1 : PC71BM and P3 : PC71BM blend films , resulting in higher photocurrent density from better exciton dissociation and more efficient charge transport. Compared to P1 : PC71BM , P3 : PC71BM film shows a clearer and more interconnected biphasic nanostructure , accounting for the higher photocurrent density in this film. Interestingly , from polymer P1 , to P2 , and to P3 , the V oc of the solar cells increases from 0.45 to 0.59 V and to 0.79 V ( 1 : 1 polymer / PC71BM solar cells ). The replacement of linear side chains in P1 by the branched side chains in P2 results in ∼ 0.2 V increase of V oc , and this enhancement is in good agreement with the electrochemically estimated HOMO levels ( Table 1 ). Furthermore , replacement of strongly donating dialkoxybithiophene units in P1 with cyclopentadithiophene units in P3 leads to ∼ 0.4 V increase in V oc , also in perfect agreement with electrochemical estimation of HOMO energy levels. The stronger electron releasing capability of dialkoxybithiophene units destabilizes the HOMOs in polymers P1 and P2. The variation of the photovoltaic properties of these new polymers indicates that strong acceptor and weak donor could be ideal partners 16,66 for constructing high - performance donor - acceptor polymers with appropriate band gap and frontier molecular orbitals for application in BHJ solar cells. 67 In summary , we have incorporated the electron - deficient unit , TPD , into three new donor - acceptor copolymer semiconductors for applications in BHJ solar cells and field - effect transistors.

PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped into P3HT : PCBM blend solution with different doping ratios ( 1 , 2 and 5 wt % ) and the surface morphology of PCBM-Ph-P3HT - doped film was studied by AFM , indicating that PCBM-Ph-P3HT promotes the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT and PCBM components due to its amphiphilicity toward P3HT and PCBM like a \" surfactant \" .

The enhancement of PCE is evidently attributed to the increase of short - circuit current ( J sc ) , and proposed enhancement mechanism is that the improvement on the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT and PCBM components upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping leads to the increase of the charge carrier mobility .

This was explained by the migration of the P3HT-b-P(S 8 A 2 )-C 60 block copolymer as a surfactant into the interface between P3HT and PCBM , resulting in the improved miscibility of P3HT and PCBM. 25 Similarly , Jo et al. synthesized PCBM end - capped P3HT ( P3HT-C 60 ) and their TEM study revealed that P3HT-C 60 doped at the optimized ratio of 2.5 wt % reduced the domain size of the P3HT : PCBM composite lm and suppressed the macrophase separation for prolonged thermal annealing as an effective compatibilizer. 26 In a similar way PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped into a P3HT : PCBM blend solution with different doping ratios ( 1 , 2 , and 5 wt % ) and the blend lms of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT : PCBM were prepared by casting from chlorobenzene followed by slow evaporation at room temperature for 10 min. Fig. 4 which is comparable to the reported values with devices fabricated under similar conditions ( chlorobenzene as solvent ). 6,24 When PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped in the P3HT : PCBM photoactive layer with very low doping ratios of 0.5 and 1 wt % , obvious enhancements of PCE were observed from 3.13% to 3.40% , respectively. However , with the further increase of PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio to 2 wt % , the PCE of the device decreases to 3.28% ( see Table 1 ). As a result , the PCE of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT : PCBM device shows the maximum ( 3.40% ) at the optimum PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio of 1 wt % , which has ca. 12% enhancement compared to that of reference P3HT : PCBM device. A careful examination of each photovoltaic parameter is made so as to disclose the factor accounting for the enhancement of the PCE upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping. Clearly , V oc of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT : PCBM devices changes very slightly ( 0.60 - 0.63 V ) compared to that of the reference P3HT : PCBM device.",

    "sentence": "Likewise , FF experiences very subtle variation with and without PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ( see Table 1 ). Nevertheless , with the increase of the PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio to 1 wt % , J sc of the PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT : PCBM device increases dramatically from 8.93 to 9.92 mA cm^-2 ( ca. 11% enhancement ) , and the enhancement ratio is quite comparable to that of the PCE. When the doping ratio of PCBM-Ph-P3HT is further increased to 2 wt % , J sc decreases to 9.69 mA cm^-2 . Fig. 6 presents the dependence of the enhancements of J sc and PCE on the PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio , clearly indicating the maximum enhancement of J sc ( ca. 11% enhancement ) and PCE ( ca. 12% enhancement ) at the optimum PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio of 1 wt % . Hence , the enhancement of PCE is evidently attributed to the increase of J sc . Interestingly , this phenomena is quite similar to the case of P3HT-b-P(S 8 A 2 )-C 60 doping in P3HT : PCBM BHJ - PSC devices reported in ref. 25 in which an enhancement of J sc leads to an increase in PCE , and the effect of P3HT-b-P(S 8 A 2 )-C 60 is proposed to improve the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT : PCBM BHJ composite. 25 On the basis of the similarity of the effect of PCBM-Ph-P3HT on both the surface morphology of P3HT : PCBM lm and device performance of P3HT : PCBM BHJ - PSC to that of P3HT-b-P(S 8 A 2 )-C 60 , the enhancement of J sc resulting from PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping can be interpreted by a similar mechanism. Since J sc is dependent on not only the multiplication of the photoinduced charge carrier density and the charge carrier mobility within the active material but also the interface properties between the active layers and the electrodes , 10 presumably the improvement on the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT : PCBM components upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping , as revealed in the above surface morphology study , leads to the increase of the charge carrier mobility. Accordingly the decrease of J sc with higher doping ratio of PCBM-Ph-P3HT ( 2 wt % ) may be understood by the excessive phase segregation promoted by PCBM-Ph-P3HT which is unfavorable for charge carrier diffusion within the photoactive layer. 25 In summary , employing a postpolymerization approach followed by a Steglich esterication reaction , we have successfully synthesized a novel double cable donor - acceptor P3HT derivative ( PCBM-Ph-P3HT ) , in which the PCBM moiety as the side chain is closely linked to the thiophene unit via a phenyl group. The Steglich esterication reaction involved in the last step was demonstrated to have a high conversion rate and simplied signicantly the synthesis to merely three steps. The successful attachment of PCBM to the P3HT backbone is conrmed by both 1H NMR and UV - Vis spectroscopic studies , and the absorption features of PCBM and P3HT components are both retained in PCBM-Ph-P3HT.",

PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped into the P3HT : PCBM blend solution with different doping ratios ( 0.5 , 1 , 2 and 5 wt % ) so as to investigate the effect of PCBM-Ph-P3HT on both the surface morphology of P3HT : PCBM lm and device performance of P3HT : PCBM BHJ - PSCs. The AFM study on the surface morphology of PCBM-Ph-P3HT doped P3HT : PCBM lm reveals that PCBM-Ph-P3HT promotes the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT : PCBM due to its amphiphilicity toward P3HT and PCBM components like a \" surfactant \" .

In order to increase the hole mobility of polymer donors , polymer chains are required to have a planar structure and closely pack in films. 6 Main chain donor - acceptor ( D-A ) alternating design is a very efficient way to tune the absorption and energy level of conjugated polymers through the intramolecular charge transfer from donor to acceptor unit. 3g,7 On the one hand , benzothiadiazole is a commonly used acceptor unit in construction of D-A alternating conjugated polymers , and high power conversion efficiency has been achieved for benzothiadiazole containing D-A alternating copolymers. 8 On the other hand , 2,7-linked fluorene ( two benzene ring bridged by carbon atom ) , 7e,8a,9 2,7-linked carbazole ( two benzene rings bridged by nitrogen atom ) , 2e,10 and 2,7-linked silafluorene ( two benzene rings bridged by silicon atom ) 6c,11 have been used as donor units for the construction of the D-A copolymers. However , until now there is no report on using 3,7-linked dibenzothiophene ( two benzene rings bridged by sulfur atom ) as donor unit in synthesizing D-A alternating copolymers. It is worthy noting that Wang et al. have found that marked chalcogen - chalcogen interactions exist in chalcogen - annulated perylene solid films , which may facilitate charge transport. 12 In this work , we design and synthesize three D-A alternating copolymers with 3,7-linked 2,8-bis(alkoxy)dibenzothiophene as the donor unit and benzothiadiazole or 3,4-bis(octyloxy)benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit. We attached two alkoxy substituents on the 2,8-positions of dibenzothiophene to ensure that the two alkoxy chains do not hinder the π-π stacking of polymer backbones in solid films and generates soluble polymers.. For the first time , we demonstrate that 2,8-bis(alkoxy) - substituted dibenzothiophene can be a useful donor unit for constructing main chain D-A alternating narrow band gap conjugated polymer for high efficiency polymer solar cells. In addition , we have found that conjugated polymers ( P3 ) with 2,8-bis(alkoxy)dibenzothiophene as the donor unit and 5,6-bis(octyloxy)substituted benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit show a strong internal charge transfer ( ICT ) absorption in the long wavelength region , whereas copolymers ( P1 and P2 ) with 2,8-bis(alkoxy)dibenzothiophene as the donor unit and benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit show a relative weak ICT absorption. As expected , the strong absorbed P3 - based polymer solar cells show higher PCE than the weak absorbed P1 - and P2 - based polymer solar cell devices.",

    "sentence": "Benzo [ 1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]-dithiophene ( BDT ) , as one of the most successful electron donor units , has emerged as an attractive building block for PSCs due to its rigidity , coplanarity by fusing a benzene with two anking thiophene units , high hole mobility , extended p - conjugated structures , and proper side chain patterns for enhanced solubility. 26,27 Very recently , via replacing the alkoxy-substitutes attached to the BDT - based D-A copolymer with alkylthienyl groups , Hou et al. 5 were capable of constructing a two - dimensional ( 2-D ) conjugated BDT - polymer possessing a broader absorption band , a lower highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , a higher hole mobility , as well as a better photovoltaic efficiency than that of the alkoxysubstituted analogues. In a relevant contribution , we reported a new alternating copolymer PBDT - TFQ containing an alkoxysubstituted-BDT moiety , and a uorinated quinoxaline ( TFQ ) unit as the D and the A , respectively , which was then applied in organic photovoltaic devices ( OPVs ) with power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) up to 8% . 3 This result indicates that TFQ is one of the efficacious acceptor units for organic semiconductors because of its strong electron affinity that offers deep HOMO energy levels and a broad absorption range , which are important parameters for p - type semiconducting polymers. 3 However , one of the main bottlenecks for the PBDT - TFQ is its relatively short absorption coverage at the near - infrared ( NIR ) region due to the fact that the TFQ moiety possesses a high content of benzene rings. The high aromaticity and hence the great stabilization energy of phenyl substitution leads to a relatively larger optical bandgap that limits light - harvesting. This drawback may be crucial , which motivated us to further replace the phenyl substitutions of the TFQ core with thienyl substitutions in an aim to achieve better sunlight harvesting. This is simply due to the fact that sulfur is a soer atom ( cf. the carbon atom ) so that thienyl substitution is expected to enhance the p-conjugation. In this context , we report herein a facile and straightforward synthetic methodology to prepare a novel semi-crystalline uorinated thienyl-quinoxaline - based D-A alternating copolymer with thiophene p - bridge units , namely , poly{4,8-bis(5 -(2-ethyl- hexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt- [ 5,8-bis(5 0 -thiophen-2 0 -yl)-6,7 -diuoro-2,3-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2yl)quinoxaline-5,5 0 -diyl ] } ( PBDTT - TTFQ , see Scheme 1 ) , by Stille coupling polymerization reactions , which turns out to be a very promising candidate for efficient PSCs. This low bandgap polymer , designed based on the intrachain D-A copolymer motif , was capable of extending the absorption into the red and NIR region with the desired deep HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels , and also exhibited a higher hole mobility.",

On the basis of the D-A concept , the medium electron - donating BDTT moiety and strong electron - accepting TTFQ unit were utilized to synthesize the low bandgap PBDTT - TTFQ copolymer. The brief synthetic routes of monomers and the corresponding polymer are illustrated in Scheme 1. PBDTT - TTFQ was synthesized in good yield through a Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as a catalyst via thermal heating shown in the ESI. † The crude polymer was precipitated into methanol and ltered , followed by careful extraction with methanol , acetone , dichloromethane and chloroform with Soxhlet apparatus to remove byproducts and oligomers. The nal product was obtained from the chloroform fraction precipitated into methanol , ltered and dried under vacuum for 12 h. PBDTT - TTFQ exhibits an excellent lm - casting property as well as good solubility in common halogenated solvents. The numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) of the synthesized copolymer PBDTT - TTFQ was determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using a polystyrene standard in THF eluent , and was found to be 43 kg mol^-1 with a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 1.58. The thermal stability of the copolymer was conrmed by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) at a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C min -1 under nitrogen atmosphere. The onset decomposition temperature of PBDTT - TTFQ at 5% weight loss is 405 °C , indicating high thermal stability of the as-prepared polymer ( see Fig. 1a ). Through differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) measurements , PBDTT - TTFQ copolymer shows a high glasstransition temperature ( T g ) of 126 °C probably because of the high chain rigidity of the polymer backbone. The optical absorption spectra of PBDTT - TTFQ acquired in 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) solution and as a lm are shown in Fig. 1b. PBDTT - TTFQ in dilute DCB solution exhibits a broad and strong absorption spectral feature across the entire UV - vis region , with three major absorption bands and hence peak wavelengths located at 359 , 421 and 563 nm. The two higher energy bands originate from the localized p-p* transitions , whereas the lowest lying band is attributed to the ICT from the PBDTT unit to the TTFQ core. In the polymer lm , the corresponding absorption becomes broader and is signicantly red - shied as compared with the corresponding maxima of the polymer solution with four peaks at 361 , 441 , 593 and 645 nm.",

Such an ordered packing of polymer chains is benecial for improving the charge carrier mobility of the resulting lms. Furthermore , the absorption edge ( l edge ) of PBDTT - TTFQ lm is 742 nm , from which the lowest - lying energy gap E opt g of PBDTT - TTFQ , deduced from the onset of absorption in the solid state , is determined to be 1.67 eV. Detailed optical and electrochemical properties of PBDTT - TTFQ are summarized in Table 1. Experimentally , cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to examine the electrochemical properties and determine the HOMO and LUMO energies of the as-prepared copolymer ( see Fig. S14 † ). The PBDTT - TTFQ copolymer showed stable and quasi-reversible p - doping and n - doping processes , which are important prerequisites for p - type semiconductor materials. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PBDTT - TTFQ were found to be -5.34 and -3.26 eV , respectively. A slightly higher energy bandgap was determined using CV ( 2.08 eV ) than that from UV - vis absorption measurements ( 1.67 eV ). The discrepancy , on the one hand , is probably because of an energy barrier between the polymer lm and electrode used in the CV measurement. On the other hand , however , the different binding energy of excitons created in the optical and electrochemical measurement can not be eliminated. A deeply lowlying HOMO energy level was obtained for PBDTT - TTFQ , which is in an ideal range to ensure better air - stability and can be anticipated to approach high V oc , in accordance with the linear correlation of the difference between the HOMO energy level of a donor polymer and the LUMO energy level of an acceptor. 28 Considering the LUMO level of PC71BM is located at -4.0 eV , the offset between donor polymer and acceptor PC71BM should provide a sufficient driving force for efficient exciton dissociation at the D-A interface , ensuring energetically favorable electron transfer. 1,2 To provide an in-depth insight into the molecular architecture of the polymer , a molecular simulation was carried out using density functional theory ( DFT ) at the B3LYP / 6-31G* level with the Gaussian 09 package in an aim to estimate the optimized geometries and the corresponding charge - density isosurfaces properties. The resulting frontier molecular orbitals depicted in Fig. 2 predict that the electron density of the HOMO is mainly localized at the PBDTT and in part at the benzene site of TTFQ , while the electron density of the LUMO is dominantly localized on the entire TTFQ moiety. The analysis provides sufficient evidence of the formation of a D-p-A structure and the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) behavior of the material.",

    "sentence": "Photovoltaic properties of the PBDTT - TTFQ copolymer were investigated in solar cells with a device conguration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al. The asymmetric PC71BM was used due to its stronger light absorption in the visible region than that of PC61BM. Fig. 3a depicts the current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves of the BHJ solar devices with various blend ratios of PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM measured under simulated one - sun AM1.5G illumination. It was noticed that the V oc of PBDTT - TTFQ - based devices dropped from 0.75 to 0.72 V with increasing PC71BM content in the blends , and the device with a D-A ratio of 1 : 1 showed the highest J sc in these two conditions. As reported , the device fabrication process of a PSC can be further improved by thermal annealing and / or by using 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) as an additive owing to its high boiling point ( 168 °C ) and ability to solvate the fullerenes during the spin - coating process. 29,30 In this work , both of these two methods ( 150 °C for 10 min , 3 vol % DIO ) were employed to optimize the device performance. The device based on the PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 in wt % ) blends revealed a V oc of 0.75 V , a J sc of 14.6 mA cm^-2 , a FF of 56.1% , delivering an exceptional PCE of 6.1% . Indeed , the high V oc is attributed to the lower - lying HOMO energy level of PBDTT - TTFQ as a result of the uorine electron - withdrawing effect on the TTFQ unit , and the result is in complete accord with previous reports. 3,4,7,31 The introduction of uorine substituents on D-A conjugated polymers has a minor effect on their optical properties but affects signicantly their energy levels owing to its strong electronegativity. This has led to the decrease of both HOMO and LUMO energy levels , rendering higher V oc values. The superior PSC performance of the 1 : 1 blends is associated with the high hole mobility and better nanoscale morphology of the interpenetrating network ( vide infra ) , allowing efficient exciton dissociation and enhancing charge carrier transportation. [32][33][34][35][36] However , further increasing the blend ratio to 1 : 2 signicantly deteriorates all photovoltaic parameters ( V oc , J sc , and FF ) and results in a lower PSC efficiency ( see Fig. 3a and Table 2 ). To verify the accuracy of the photo J-V measurements , the corresponding incident photon - to - current efficiency ( IPCE ) spectra of the devices elaborated above were measured under illumination of monochromatic light shown in Fig. 3b. According to the PSC devices fabricated with various PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM blend ratios , very broad panchromatic spectra over the entire excitation spectral range were obtained from IPCE measurements.",

Moreover , the IPCE spectra accord well with the absorption spectra of the blends ( Fig. S15 † ) , resulting in a close correlation with the photocurrents. The integral J sc of both devices with blend ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 from IPCE curves are 13.4 and 11.7 mA cm^-2 , respectively. The J sc values calculated from integration of the IPCE spectra are within 5-10 % , which conform well to those obtained from the J-V measurements , supporting the reliability of the photovoltaic measurement. Regardless of the blend ratios , the data for these devices highlight an important fact in that IPCE exceeds 50% for more than half of the visible region. Besides the absorption and energy levels , charge - carrier mobility is another crucial factor for achieving high - efficiency devices. Both hole - and electron - mobility were calculated using the space - charge - limited current ( SCLC ) model at low voltage. 37,38 The device characteristics were extracted by modeling the dark current under forward bias , described by the Mott - Gurney law. We found about threefold enhancement in hole mobility of the 1 : 1 PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM devices compared to the 1 : 2 PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM devices , with mobility increasing from 2.2 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 to 6.5 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( see Fig. 4 ). Moreover , the 1 : 1 device shows a wellbalanced mobility ( m e / m h = 1.5 ) as compared to that of the 1 : 2 device ( m e / m h = 4.0 ). The balanced mobility contributes , in part , to the higher J sc and FF observed in the optimized BHJ devices because the accumulated SCLC charges and hence recombination processes are reduced by the increased hole mobility and enhanced charge collection efficiency. 35,36 The nano-scale morphology plays an important role in the device performance. Proper morphology is necessary not only for exciton dissociation but also for charge transport to respective electrodes for efficient collection. [32][33][34][35][36] Therefore , the morphological structures of PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM blend lms with various compositions were probed by tapping mode atom force microscopy ( TM - AFM ) measurements. In Fig. 5a and d , the pristine lm reveals a highly dense brillar nanostructure with a certain degree of long - range order , suggesting the nanoscale self - assembly of PBDTT and TTFQ segments ( vide infra ). The distinct spacing of the nanostructures has a lateral dimension ranging from 18 to 22 nm , which is approximately in the same magnitude as the exciton diffusion length , and may effectively assist charge transport prior to recombination.",

The π-bridge between the C donor unit and the QP acceptor unit is thiophene ( T ) in P(C-T-QP) , bithiophene ( BT ) in P(C-BT-QP) , and terthiophene ( TT ) in P(C-TT-QP) or P(C-TT-QP-Zn ). These copolymers possess good solubility , high thermal stability , broad absorption , and low bandgap ranging from 1.66 to 1.73 eV. The influence of the π-bridge and the central Zn ion on the electronic and photovoltaic properties was investigated and discussed in detail. It was found that the π-bridge played an important role in tuning the effective conjugation length and therefore significantly affected the molecular architecture and optoelectronic properties of the copolymers. With the π-bridge varying from thiophene to bithiophene , then to terthiophene , the hole mobility of the copolymers increased gradually , and the absorption was broadened in turn. Zn ion in the porphyrin ring also had a significant influence on the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties. Bulk heterojunction solar cells with the polymers as donor and PC71BM as acceptor demonstrated PCEs of 0.97% for P(C-T-QP) , 1.97% for P(C-BT-QP) , 2.53% for P(C-TT-QP) , and 1.45% for P(C-TT-QP-Zn ). All of them are among the highest PCE values of PSCs based on porphyrin polymers. Among the four polymers , although the P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows the highest hole mobility and the widest absorption , the corresponding PSC demonstrated the lowest PCE because the morphology of P(C-TT-QP-Zn) / PC71BM blend film is not beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport. This study provides a new insight toward the design and future development of quinoxalinoporphyrin - based conjugated polymers . Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) which are based on solution - processable conjugated polymer donor and fullerene derivative acceptor materials have been widely studied due to their low - cost solution fabrication process , lightweight , and device mechanical flexibility as well as potential contribution to clean and renewable energy. To achieve highperformance PSCs , the electron - donating conjugated polymers need to have appropriate band gaps to maximize solar radiation capture , good hole mobility , and reasonable highest occupied molecular orbital levels ( HOMO ) to maximize the short circuit current ( J sc ) and open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , respectively. 1-11 At present , conjugated polymers with electron donor - acceptor ( D-A ) architecture are particularly attractive due to the facile tunability of their electronic structure of the main chain by controlling the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) from the donor units to the acceptor units. 12,13 Porphyrins and their derivatives have been intensively studied over many years due to their importance in the photochemistry and biochemical processes.",

    "sentence": "Porphyrins are preferable photosensitizers for utilizing solar energy for the reason that they play an important role in the photosynthesis of plants. Their large π-conjugation systems as well as their good thermal stabilities also make porphyrins to be promising materials for organic photonic and electronic applications. 14 Up to now , porphyrin - based small molecules BHJ solar cells and dye - sensitized solar cells ( DSSCs ) have reached power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of more than 5% and 12% , respectively. 15,16 However , when applying porphyrin polymers in solar cells , poor PCEs were obtained ( less than 1% ). 17-23 The relatively narrow absorption spectrum and less efficient conjugation in the main chain are the critical factors that limit the improvement of photoelectric properties. The typical absorption spectra of porphyrin units exhibit a sharp and strong Soret band ( 410-430 nm ) and weak Q-bands ( 530- 540 nm ) without absorption between them , and the conventional meso-aryl linkage in porphyrin polymers can not broaden the absorption effectively by intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) due to the large aryl-porphyrin dihedral angles. 23-25 However , quinoxalino[2 , 3-b′]porphyrins are more π-expanded systems and were proposed as \" molecular wires \" . 26 By incorporation of different central metal ions or selective functionalization at β-pyrrolic positions , it enable \" fine - tuning \" of electronic properties of compounds by altering relative energy levels of the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ). But , the studies about quinoxalinoporphyrin are still at the level of small molecules or large multiporphyrin arrays , and it has not yet been used in polymers. 27 Recently , we designed and reported a new D-π-A copolymer P(C-TT-QP) with quinoxalinoporphyrin as acceptor unit , 2,7-carbazole as donor unit , and terthiophene as a π-bridge. P(C-TT-QP) exhibited an unusually broadened and enhanced Q-band absorbance compared to other porphyrin - based conjugated polymers reported in the literature. More interestingly , the absorption blank between the Soret band and Q-bands has been covered perfectly for the first time. As a result , PCE of solar cell based on P(C-TT-QP) reached 2.5% . 28 These results indicate that the photovoltaic performance of the porphyrinbased conjugated polymers could be greatly improved by using quinoxalinoporphyrin. However , to achieve higher efficiency porphyrin polymers , it is needed to further study the effect of the molecular structure on the optical , electrochemical , and photovoltaic properties. 29 Herein , two novel quinoxalinoporphyrin - based copolymers P(C-T-QP) and P(C-BT-QP) were synthesized. Combining with our previously reported P(C-TT-QP) , the three copolymers were used to systematically study the effects of the bridges on absorption , energy levels , and charge transport properties of the copolymers. On the other hand , it is noted that nearly in all the literatures reported for the porphyrin - based photovoltaic polymers so far , zinc(II) porphyrins rather than free - base porphyrins were chosen as building blocks without discussion on their difference in photovoltaic properties.",

    "sentence": "All the polymers show absorptions in the regions of Soret band and Q-bands. Compared to the reference QP and QP-Zn absorption , the Soret band and Q-bands of the polymers are both broadened while the Q-bands enhance observably. The blank between the Soret and Q-bands is filled completely. And the absorption areas between the Soret and Qbands increase gradually with the oligothiophene bridges varying from thiophene to bithiophene and then to terthiophene due to more extended π-conjugation resulting in a more effective ICT effect. The results demonstrate that the effective ICT effect along the main chain of polymers is the key factor to broaden and enhance Q-band absorbance and fill blank absorption. The absorption spectra of the four polymers in the solid state are all broadened compared to their corresponding solution spectra. However , only slight red - shifts ( ca. 1-5 nm ) of their absorption maxima are obtained , which is probably due to the bulky 4-tert-butylphenyl substituents on the porphyrins that prevent aggregation in the solid state. 30 In Figure 2a,b , it is clear that the absorption spectra of P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) vary with the number of the conjugated thiophene rings. A comparison of the polymers reveals that P(C-TT-QP) exhibits the most bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum at 438 nm in the chloroform solution , whereas P(C-T-QP) exhibited the most hypsochromic shift absorption maximum at 427 nm. The absorption edges for solid films of P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) increase from 679 , 736 , to 742 nm , corresponding to optical band gaps ( E g opt ) decreasing from 1.83 , 1.68 , to 1.67 eV , respectively. The decreasing in E g opt from P(C-T-QP) to P(C-BT-QP) and to P(C-TT-QP) can attribute to the presence of a more extended and delocalized π-electron system ( in both solutions and solid films ) which extends the conjugation lengths of the copolymers and reduces the band gap. Also , increasing in the length of the oligothiophene bridges is beneficial to decrease steric hindrance between QP and its neighboring units. In Figure 2c,d , although the absorption maxima of P(C-TT-QP) and QP slightly red - shift more than P(C-TT-QP-Zn) and QP-Zn both in solution and in solid film , P(C-TT-QP-Zn) and QP-Zn possess more bathochromic Q-bands , and the absorption edges of P(C-TT-QP-Zn) red - shift ca. 7 nm compared to P(C-TT-QP ). It can be noticed that there are individually identifiable two components of the Soret band in QP-Zn with one of these moving to lower energy compared to the free - base analogue , and it is clear that the lower - energy Soret component shows low intensity. This feature is retained in the spectrum of P(C-TT-QP-Zn) with a shoulder at ca. 500 nm. The reason for this phenomenon is somewhat complicated , and further study is ongoing. But at least we can infer that QP-Zn shows more extended π-conjugation than the free - base analogue.",

Also , it is clear that the PL intensity of P(C-TT-QP-Zn) is lower than those of other three polymers which means weaker energy transfer when incorporate Zn ion in QP. The emission peak wavelengths λ emi of P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) are consistent with the trend of λ abs in their corresponding absorption spectra. P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows the largest bathochromic - shifted spectrum with maximum emission at 755 nm compared to P(C-TT-QP) , which is corresponding to the red - shifted Soret band. Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) has been employed and considered as an effective tool in investigating electrochemical properties of conjugated oligomers and polymers. 31 From the value of onset oxidation potential ( E ox ) and E g opt of the polymers , the HOMO and the LUMO were calculated and are listed in Table 2. The moderate onset oxidation potentials of P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) are deter - mined to be 0.68 , 0.65 , and 0.62 V vs Ag / Ag + , respectively , corresponding with the HOMO levels to be -5.39 , -5.36 , and -5.33 eV. It was worthwhile to note that the HOMO energy levels of the three polymers increase with the increasing conjugation length. The copolymers possess comparable LUMO levels between -3.66 and -3.68 eV , demonstrating that the LUMO levels of the QP - based polymers are mainly dominated by the QP unit. 31b Compared to P(C-TT-QP) , P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows higher HOMO / LUMO energy levels , which can be attributed to the increased electron density , and it can be inferred that the electron - accepting ability of QP-Zn is weaker than QP. 30 Since the open circuit voltage V oc of BHJ PSCs is correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the fullerene and HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , therefore a reasonable V oc for QP or QP-Zn - based PSCs is anticipated due to the low - lying HOMO energy level. On the other hand , the LUMO energy levels of these polymers are located at reasonable positions from -3.66 to -3.68 eV which offer enough driving force for charge separation and transfer without too much energy loss. 13 Theoretical Calculations. To provide further insight into the fundamentals of molecular architecture , molecular simulation was carried out for P(C-TT-QP) and P(C-TT-QP-Zn ).

    "sentence": "For unipolar transport in a trap - free semiconductor with an ohmic injecting contact , the SCLC can be approximated by the Mott - Gurney equation : ε ε μ γ ≅ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ J V L V L 9^8 exp 0.891 r 0^0 2^3 ( 3 ) where J is the current density , ε r is the dielectric constant of the polymer , ε 0 is the free - space permittivity ( 8.85 × 10^-12 F / m ) , μ 0 is the charge mobility at zero field , γ is a constant , L is the thickness of the blended film layer , V = V appl - V bi , V appl is the applied potential , and V bi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode ( in this device structure , V bi = 0.2 V ). Figure 9 displays ln(JL 3 / V 2 ) versus ( V / L ) 0.5 curve for the measurement of the hole mobility of the copolymers by the SCLC method. As summarized in Table 4 , the hole mobilities of the polymers calculated using eq 3 are 3.1 × 10^-6 , 9.6 × 10^-6 , 3.3 × 10^-5 , and 1.3 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , P(C-TT- QP ) , and P(C-TT-QP-Zn) , respectively. It can be noticed that P(C-T-QP) and P(C-BT-QP) show lower hole mobilities than P(C-TT-QP ). This variation in device behavior can be attributed to the change of the coplanarity in the polymer backbone by the introduction of various oligothiophene bridges , and we can conclude that the change of the π-bridge from thiophene to bithiophene , and then to terthiophene , results in gradully increase of the intrachain mobility because of more extended π-conjugation and less steric hindrance. P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows the highest hole mobility of the order of 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , indicating that the incorporation of zinc may be in favor of enhancing the packing structure in the blends. The V oc , J sc , fill factor ( FF ) , PCE , and hole mobility of the PSCs are summarized in Table 4. An obvious increase in the J sc and PCE can be observed from P(C-T-QP) to P(C-TT-QP) ( i.e. , P(C-T-QP) < P(C-BT-QP) < P(C-TT-QP) ). The J sc of the polymers increased from 4.15 , 6.80 , to 8.32 mA / cm^2 , which is consistent with the lowered band gaps ( from 1.73 , 1.68 , to 1.67 eV ). The optimum photovoltaic performance with the maximum PCE value of 2.53% ( V oc = 0.68 V , J sc = 8.32 mA / cm^2 , FF = 0.45 ) was obtained in the PSC device having a weight ratio of P(C-TT-QP):PC71BM = 1 : 3.",

    "sentence": "When complexing zinc in the center , P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows lower FF(0.36) and J sc ( 5.79 ) compared to P(C-TT-QP) and a PCE of 1.45% is obtained. Figure 10 shows the external quantum efficiencies ( EQE ) curves of the devices incorporating the polymer : PC71BM blends. It is apparent that all devices exhibited a broad response range , covering from 300 to 750 nm with maximum EQE values of 37% at ∼ 465 nm , 48% at ∼ 475 nm , and 51% at ∼ 460 nm for the PSCs based on P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) , respectively. Compared to the absorption spectra of pristine polymers , the significantly broadened EQE responses in the visible region can be attributed to both the intrinsic absorptions of the polymers and PC71BM. P(C-TT-QP) - based device improved the EQE upon that of P(C-T-QP) and P(C-BT-QP) markedly , especially in the range of 400-500 nm. It is remarkable to see that the light - harvesting ability of P(C-TT-QP) ( with its commensurately high charge mobilities and favorable light absorption characterisitics ) can be increased by introducing terthiophene in the main chain. This is in agreement with increased maximum absorption with increasing m from M 1 to M 3 , resulting in higher PCE for the polymers. 29a-e P(C-TT-QP-Zn) showed lower EQE than P(C-TT-QP) with maximum EQE value of 44% at ∼ 480 nm. Additionally , a less than 10% difference between the J sc and the integral of the EQE is observed. Since the EQE was tested in the air , this discrepancy should be mainly ascribed to the degradation caused by the oxidation of the Ca electrode. We noted that Wong et al. also found the zinc porphyrin derivative functioned worse in solar cells than the free - base porphyrin derivatives , 30 and they attributed the poor performance of solar cell to the less stable of zinc porphyrin. However , in this work , we observed that the zinc porphyrin polymer possesses better thermal stability than their free - base analogues. Considering the fact that the P(C-TT-QP-Zn) possesses the highest hole mobility and the strongest and the widest absorption among the four polymers , herein , we conjectured the possible reason for the worst performance of P(C-TT-QP-Zn) - based PSC is the film morphology of the P(C-TT-QP-Zn) / PC71BM blend. In order to understand the effect of mophology of the photoactive layers on the photovoltaic performance of the polymer solar cells , the mophological structures of the blend films of polymer / PC71BM were analyzed by tapping mode atom force microscopy ( AFM ) measurements. Figure 11 shows the AFM images of the blend films. The blend films based on P(C-TT-QP) and P(C-TT-QP-Zn) both demonstrated low roughness of 1.05 and 1.29 nm , respectively. The P(C-TT-QP) / PC71BM blend possesses higher FF due to its smoother surface. For the P(C-TT-QP) / PC71BM blend film , the bright patterns of polymer domains showed a good interpenetrating network which is beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport.",

Polythiophene derivatives have attracted a great deal of attention in organic electronics due to their fascinating optical and electronic properties. 1 A promising application is use of these materials as the active semiconducting layers in organic solar cells where solution processability can be exploited in the fabrication of large area , low - cost , and flexible devices. 2,3 For example , a commonly used polymer donor material is the well - studied poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , and PCE in excess of 5% have been reported for the P3HT / [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PC60BM ) BHJ photovoltaic cells. [4][5][6] Besides P3HT polymer , many conjugated materials with a thiophene backbone are also well studied. Recently , Ong et al. reported a new class of solution processable high - performance polythiophene , poly(3,3'''-didodecylquaterthiophene) ( PQT ) [7][8] ( Scheme 1 ) , for organic field effect transistors ( OFETs ) , which is similar to P3HT in structures and also shows similar absorption spectra. Compared to P3HT , PQT has longer alkyl side chains to induce a better crystalline structure for higher hole mobility ( 0.18 cm^2 °V -1 °s -1 ) , 7 which is nearly twice as large as that of P3HT ( 0.1 cm^2 °V -1 °s -1 ). 9,10 In addition , PQT exhibits about 0.1 eV lower lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) levels ( -5.1 eV ) than P3HT. 7 Such lowered ionization energy could also be of interest for enhancing chemical stability of the compound as well as device lifetime. 11 Since the V oc of organic solar cells is limited by the difference of the HOMO level of the electron donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) level of the electron acceptor , solar cells using PQT as electron donor should reach higher V oc than those based on P3HT. 12 Hence , due to its lower HOMO level and higher hole mobility , together with a similar broad absorption spectrum to P3HT , which are the most important parameters for a successful polymer donor in photovoltaic devices , PQT offers the potential to be used in polymer / fullerene BHJ photovoltaic cells. However , the BHJ photovoltaic devices using P3HT exhibited far superior to those using PQT.",

    "sentence": "[13][14][15] To the best of our knowledge , PQT / PC60BM system produced the best device with optimal PCE of 1.15% for a PC60BM loading of 80 wt % . 16 By using the fullerene derivative PC70BM instead of PC60BM , the PCE of 1.4% could be obtained. 17 The differences in device performance for these two similar polymers necessitate the studies on the relationships between solid structure - property properties. Scherf et al. have made a comparative study between P3HT and PQT. The authors found that PQT forms nanoparticle dispersions in solution. The devices made from mixtures of PQT and fullerene consequently contained pre-formed PQT crystalline nanoparticles that cause mesoscopically demixed blends with low charge - separation efficiency. 16 However , Mcgehee and coworkers observed that PC60BM molecules can intercalate into the alkyl chains and form a cocrystallized structure in solid state , which might be a reason for its low efficiency. 18,19 Beside these morphological explorations , it is also of interest to design and synthesize QT - based copolymers with new functionalities. In order to improve PCEs , the most common and successful strategy is decreasing the band gaps of polymer donors so as to maintain a broad overlap with the solar spectrum and ensure effective harvesting of solar photons. This leads to higher J sc , 20,21 and lowers HOMO energy levels of polymer donors to gain larger V oc . 22 In an effort to tailoring the structure of PQT for optimized BHJ photovoltaic cells , we have synthesized two new QT - based copolymers , namely PQTF and PQTTST by introducing the fluorene and 2,5-dithienylsilole units as strategic building blocks. Fluorene has excellent oxidation stability and high hole mobility , making it beneficial for reducing HOMO energy level of polymer donors. 23 On the other hand , the 2,5-dithienylsilole units have the high electron - accepting ability due to σ*-π* conjugation in the ring , which thus have been exploited to tune the LUMO energy level and to gain narrow band gaps. 24,25 The influence on the thermal properties , morphology and energy levels by introducing fluorene and 2,5-dithienylsilole units into the backbone have been investigated. And a comparison between the photovoltaic properties based on the copolymers donors PQTF , PQTTST and homopolymer PQT have also carried out . The structure order of QT - based polymer thin films were studied by GIWAXS. Thin film samples were prepared on a silicon substrate by spin - coating from their chlorobenzene solutions. A 0.16 o incident angle was used in the experiment. As shown in Fig. 4 , PQT showed several obvious diffraction peaks in the out - of - plane direction , which characterized the structure normal to the substrates.",

Also a weak diffraction peak at 1.7 A -1 in the in-plane direction was observed , which comes from π-π staking. A shallow diffraction ring at 1.5 A -1 was observed and was ascribed to some disordered peak , yet its nature is still not clear. Compare to PQT , PQTF and PQTTST showed a much weaker first ordered peak in diffraction , as shown in figure 4b , and the position is slightly shifted to low q , indicating a spacing change. A diffraction ring at 1.46 A -1 and 1.35 A -1 was observed for PQTF and PQTTST , respectively. They are similar to the 1.5 A -1 diffraction from PQT , which we think they come from disordered alky chain stacking . Fig. 5 shows the UV - vis absorption spectra of polymers coated from the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution. It 's obvious that the absorption maximum for PQT was found to be 535 nm with a shoulder around at 575 nm. 7 The maximum absorption peaks of PQTF and PQTTST in the film were blue - shifted and red - shifted to 487 and 556 nm , respectively. We reasoned that it was caused by the change of conjugation length due to the introduction of fluorene and 2,5-diarylsilole units. Therefore , the optical band gaps ( E g ) of the PQT , PQTF and PQTTST , estimated from the absorption onset wavelength , were as low as 1.87 , 2.0 and 1.79 eV , respectively. The lowered band gap of PQTTST provides favorable light harvesting properties. The electrochemical properties of polymers were studied by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). According to de Leeuw et al. , the ionization potential ( E HOMO ) and electron affinity ( E LUMO ) are approximately equal to the onset of first oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential ( vs. Ag / Ag + ) plus 4.7 eV , respectively. 33 The anodic scan showed that the onset of oxidation for PQT , PQTF and PQTTST occurred at 0.36 , 0.62 and 0.34 eV , respectively , which corresponded to HOMO levels of -5.06 , -5.32 and -5.04 eV ( Fig. 6 ). It is observed that the HOMO level of PQTF was significantly reduced ( -5.32 eV ) as a result of incorporation of the higher ionization potential of fluorene unit , which is beneficial for achieving a high V oc in solar cells. However , no significant change in the oxidative properties was observed between PQT and PQTTST.",

    "sentence": "When scanning cathodically , all the copolymers exhibited reversible reduction waves , and the onset potentials of reduction for PQT , PQTF and PQTTST are -1.29 , -1.27 and -1.11 eV , respectively , corresponding to LUMO levels of -3.41 , -3.43 and -3.59 eV. The LUMO energy levels of PQT and PQTF lied with slight variation. However , the introduction of 2,5-diarylsilole units obviously reduced the LUMO level , which may be ascribed to the particularly low lying LUMO of the 2,5-diarylsilole units. Compared to PQT , incorporation fluorene into the backbone of PQTF only reduced the HOMO level , while the LUMO level was hardly changed. In a similar manner , incorporation of 2,5-diarylsilole in PQTTST only reduced the LUMO level , while the HOMO level was hardly influenced. PQTTST showed the smallest band gap of 1.45 eV estimated from redox properties ( Table 1 ). Such low band gap improves light absorption , leading to enhanced J sc . The energy levels and UV - vis absorption spectra are in good agreement . Photovoltaic characteristics were investigated with the conventional architecture of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC60BM / LiF / Al. For optimal photovoltaic performance , the best polymer / PC60BM weight ratio is approximately 1 : 4. Fig. 7 shows the current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves under solar simulator AM 1.5 illumination , and the photovoltaic properties of the devices are summarized in Table 2. PQT / PC60BM system showed a PCE of 1.03% , with a J sc of 3.30 mA cm^-2 , V oc of 0.71 V and fill factor ( FF ) of 0.44. This photovoltaic performance is similar to the Scherf 's report. 16 Devices fabricated using PQTF and PQTTST as polymer donor showed considerably enhanced performance with a PCE of 1.39% and 1.49% , respectively. It is important to note that the value of PCE for PQTTST / PC60BM device is so far the highest record of QT - based polymer materials. The performance improvement from the PQT / PC60BM to the PQTF / PC60BM system was mainly attributed to the increase in both V oc ( from 0.71 to 0.85 V ) and the fill factor ( from 0.44 to 0.51 ) , while the performance improvement of the PQTTST / PC60BM system was mainly due to increase of J sc ( from 3.30 to 4.77 mA cm^-2 ). The improvement in OPV performance by introducing fluorene and 2,5-diarylsilole units into the PQT backbone can be explained in terms of the energy level structures. Compared to PQT , PQTF has the lower HOMO level. Generally , the lower HOMO levels of the polymer donor , the higher the V oc . However , a lower HOMO level would lead to an increased band gap in the polymer donor and less efficient light absorption ( See UV - vis absorption part ). So PQTF / PC60BM system showed a lowest J sc of 3.08 mA cm^-2 .",

    "sentence": "34-37 Stefan and co-workers reported synthesis of polymers based on phenylethynyl-substituted BDT and their application in PSCs with PCEs up to 1.05% . 28 Watson and co-workers reported synthesis of a small molecule based on TIPS - substituted BDT unit but not any device applications. 38 There have been no reports on small molecules or polymers based on TIPS - functionalized BDT unit for organic solar cells. Thiazolothiazole ( TT ) has a rigid and coplanar fused ring and thereby could facilitate highly extended π-electron system and ' . PBDTTT - TIPS has a number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of 12^000 , weight - average molecular weight ( M w ) of 19^000 , and polydispersity index ( M w / M n ) of 1.6. PBDTTT - TIPS shows excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperature of 377 °C ( at 5% weight loss ) , as measured by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) at a heating rate of 20 °C min -1 under nitrogen ( Figure 2 ). I DS = ( W / 2L)μC i ( V G - V T ) Optical Properties. Figure 3 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDTTT - TIPS in chloroform solution ( 10^-6 M ) and in thin film ( spin - coated from chloroform solution ). The copolymer PBDTTT - TIPS in solution shows two intense absorption peaks at 548 and 586 nm , which red shift 6 and 12 nm from solution to film , respectively. Compared with PBDTTT - C12 , PBDTTT - TIPS exhibits red - shifted absorption ( 4 nm in solution ; 14 nm in film ). The red shift of absorption for PBDTTT - TIPS mainly benefits from the weak electron - withdrawing and conjugated TIPS side chains. The optical bandgap of PBDTTT - TIPS estimated from the absorption edge in film is 1.94 eV , which is a little lower than that ( 1.99 eV ) of PBDTTT - C12. Electrochemical Properties. The cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) curves of copolymer PBDTTT - TIPS and FeCp 2 + / 0 are illustrated in Figure 4. PBDTTT - TIPS displays irreversible oxidation and reduction waves. The onset oxidation and reduction potentials versus Ag are 1.0 and -1.3 V , respectively. The onset oxidation and reduction potentials versus FeCp 2 + / 0 ( halfwave potential of 0.5 eV ) are 0.5 and -1.8 V , respectively. Therefore , the HOMO and LUMO energies are estimated to be -5.3 and -3.0 eV from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials , respectively , assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp 2 + / 0 to be 4.8 eV below vacuum. Compared with PBDTTT - TIPS , PBDTTT - C12 exhibits same HOMO level but 0.2 eV higher LUMO level. The trends in the electrochemical data are therefore consistent with that in the absorption maxima and also can be attributed to the weak electron - withdrawing TIPS group. The lower LUMO level deduced from TIPS side chain was also reported in the literature.",

    "sentence": "38 Organic Field - Effect Transistors. To ensure effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes and reduce the photocurrent loss in solar cells , the high hole mobility is a basic requirement for electron donors. To measure mobilities of PBDTTT - TIPS , organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) were fabricated on octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-treated SiO 2 / Si substrates through spincoating process. The typical p - type output curve and the corresponding transfer characteristics in air are depicted in Figure 5 , which exhibits good current modulation and well - defined linear and saturation regions like PBDTTT - C12. 42 The highest hole mobility of the devices based on PBDTTT - TIPS in the saturation regime is 1.2 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , while average mobility ( 5 devices ) is 9.4 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , a little lower but in the same order with that of PBDTTT - C12 ( 2.8 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). The average on / off current ratio ( I on / I off ) is 600. Photovoltaic Properties. We use PBDTTT - TIPS as an electron donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor and fabricate bulk heterojunction PSCs with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM / Ca / Al to demonstrate the potential application of PBDTTT - TIPS in PSCs. The solvents used for device fabrication will dramatically affect the morphology of blend film and the resulting device performance. Compared to PBDTTT - C12 , PBDTTT - TIPS has a better solubility in common solvents , such as chloroform , THF , chlorobenzene , and dichlorobenzene. The PBDTTT - C12 / PC71BM blend has good solubility in chloroform but poor solubility in chlorobenzene. Therefore , the best device performance based on PBDTTT - C12 was obtained from chloroform solution. However , the PBDTTT - TIPS / PC71BM blend has good solubility in chloroform and in chlorobenzene. The devices based on PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM = 1 : 1 spin - coated from chlorobenzene solution exhibited much higher PCE ( 4.33% ) than that obtained from chloroform solution ( 1.3% ) since the solvent with high boiling point would be more beneficial to forming good - quality films. Therefore , we choose chlorobenzene other than chloroform for PBDTTT - TIPS - based device fabrication. Figure 6 shows current density-voltage curves , and Table 1 summarizes the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short circuit current density ( J sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the devices. When PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM weight ratio is 1 : 2 , the PCE of device is 3.67% , which is higher than that for PBDTTT - C12 - based device ( 2.19% ). When PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM weight ratio is 1 : 1 , the device exhibit the highest PCE of 4.33% with V oc of 0.89 V , J sc of 9.77 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 49.8% .",

    "sentence": "The change in performance with donor / acceptor weight ratio has correlation with the tendency of donor polymer to mix with fullerene acceptor , phase separation , and charge transport. Generally , for polymer donors with high hole mobilities ( > 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) , such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) and PBDTTT - TIPS , the percolation pathways for hole transport are well formed at donor / acceptor weight ratio of 1 : 1 , leading to higher PCEs. While for polymer donors with low hole mobilities ( < 10^-5 cm V -1 s^-1 ) , such as poly[2-methoxy-5-(2 0 -ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene ] ( MEH - PPV ) , the percolation pathways for electron transport are well formed at high acceptor concentration ( e.g. , 80% ) , leading to higher PCEs. 5 As shown in Figure 7 , the incident photon to converted current efficiency ( IPCE ) curve resembles absorption spectrum of the blend thin film of PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) , and the IPCE exhibits a broad plateau with IPCE values over 50% between 350 and 620 nm , leading to a high J sc of 9.77 mA cm^-2 . However , the PBDTTT-C12:PC71BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) blend gives a lower IPCE level between 300 and 700 nm , leading to a lower J sc of 4.36 mA cm^-2 , which is only half of that for PBDTTT - TIPS : PC71BM device. Although PBDTTT - TIPS and PBDTTT - C12 exhibit similar absorption , HOMO level , and hole mobility , they exhibit big difference in photovoltaic performance. To elucidate the origin , we investigate blend film morphology using atomic force microscope ( AFM ) ( Figure 8 ). For PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) blend , the films exhibit a typical cluster structure with many aggregated domains and a root-mean-square ( rms ) roughness of 1.472 nm. The domain sizes estimated by cross-section profiles are about 10-20 nm. Therefore , the nanoscale aggregated domains and perfect phase separation are beneficial to charge separation and enhanced efficiency of the PSC. In contrast , the PBDTTT-C12:PC71BM blend film exhibits large phase separation and large rms roughness up to 8.218 nm. This large phase separation scale is not favorable for efficient exciton dissociation , leading to relatively low J sc . The blend film morphology indicates that PBDTTT - TIPS has a better compatibility with PC71BM than PBDTTT - C12. Nguyen et al. found that in a poly (3-alkylthiophenes)(P3AT):PC61BM system the longer side chains of P3AT enable the higher diffusion rate of PC61BM in the polymer matrix and ultimately lead to a larger scale phase separation. 51 A new conjugated copolymer PBDTTT - TIPS containing thiazolothiazole acceptor unit and TIPS - functionalized benzodithiophene donor unit is synthesized by Pd - catalyzed Stille coupling. PBDTTT - TIPS exhibits excellent thermal stability , broad absorption , high hole mobility , and relatively low HOMO level.",

    "sentence": "Several strategies for improving the morphological stability of polymer solar cells have been developed. Exploring thermo - cleavable polymers is one of the useful solutions to improving the stability of PSCs , 29 but it involves complicated synthetic routes and large costs , limiting its applications in large - area solar cells. Using crosslinkable materials to cross-link the active layer is another approach for device stability improvement. [30][31][32] However , the existence of these cross-linkable moieties reduces the probability that molecules come into close contact with each other , thereby lowering the mobility of electrons in the material. 33 To simultaneously achieve the favorable and stable morphology of the active layer , herein , the TEO functionalized copolymer donor PBDTT-TT-TEO and fullerene acceptor PCB - TEO are explored ( Schemes 1 and 2 ). The copolymer poly{4,8bis ( 5-(2-ethylhexyl) [3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl-2-ethylhexan-1-one } ( PBDTT-TT ) without TEO side chains was also synthesized for comparison. We hoped that the cooperative assembly of the donor and acceptor via interchain interactions between the TEO side chains could construct a microphase separation nanostructure with promoted stability for highly efficient PSCs. Unexpectedly , directly blending PBDTT-TT-TEO with PCB - TEO as the active layer only affords a 2.8% PCE in the resulting device due to the discontinuous morphology of the blend lm caused by the poor solubility of PCB - TEO. However , an appropriate amount of PCB - TEO as a compatibilizer incorporated into the PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM blend can dramatically improve the device performance and stability , because PCB - TEO , which is chemically similar to the segments in PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCBM , can be located at the interface of the donor and acceptor to manipulate the miscibility between the polymer and fullerene and achieve a favorable and stable BHJ morphology by a cooperative assembly effect. The device with 5% loading of PCB - TEO achieves the highest PCE of 4.8% , approximately a 33% improvement in PCE over the PBDTT - TT : PCBM device. thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene- alt-4,6-thieno The synthetic routes of copolymers PBDTT-TT-TEO and PBDTT-TT are outlined in Scheme 1. 4,6-Dibromo-thieno [3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylic acid was reacted with TEO via an esterication reaction to yield the monomer 4,6-dibromo-thieno [ 3,4- The structures of the monomer TT - TEO and copolymers have been conrmed by 1H NMR , as shown in Fig. S1 and S2. † Compared with PBDTT-TT , copolymer PBDTT-TT-TEO shows the characteristic resonance peaks of TEO from 3.2 to 4.0 ppm , indicating the successful synthesis of the copolymer.

    "sentence": "† Unfortunately , PCB - TEO shows relatively poor solubility in common organic solvents , especially in chlorobenzene and orthodichlorobenzene. The thermal properties of the copolymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min -1 ( Fig. S4 † ). The temperature at 5% weight loss was chosen as the onset point of decomposition ( T d ). Similar to the polymer PBDTT-TT , PBDTT-TT-TEO shows little weight loss when heated up to 366 °C , suggesting that the introduction of TEO chains into the PBDTT-TT does not inuence the thermal stability of the polymer. Evidently , this is sufficient for its applications in BHJ solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. Fig. 1 shows the UV - vis absorption spectra of the PBDTT-TT and PBDTT-TT-TEO lms. The absorption spectrum of the PBDTT-TT lm shows maximum absorption at 696 nm , while the PBDTT-TT-TEO lm shows the highest peak at 701 nm. The slightly red shied band of PBDTT-TT-TEO indicates that PBDTT-TT-TEO possesses a longer efficient conjugation length than PBDTT - TT. This is because the TEO side chains can reduce the detrimental steric twist of the polymer out of planarity , which is benecial for the p-p stacking. 34 Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of polymers and estimate their highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential according to equations reported in the literature. 35 Fig. S5 † shows the cyclic voltammogram curves of the two copolymers. PBDTT-TT and PBDTT-TT-TEO possess almost identical electrochemical redox characteristics. For PBDTT-TT , the onset potential for oxidation is located around 0.27 V versus Ag / AgNO 3 , which corresponds to a highest occupied molecular orbital of -5.09 eV. The LUMO energy level of PBDTT-TT is calculated to be -3.22 eV based on the onset potential for reduction at around -1.60 V. Using similar methods , the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PBDTT-TT-TEO are -5.07 and -3.23 eV , respectively. From the results , we can draw the conclusion that PBDTT-TT-TEO has a relatively narrower band gap than PBDTT-TT , which is in line with the results of the UV - vis spectra. Because polymer chain packing can affect exciton dissociation , recombination and charge transport , 36 the crystalline structures of the donor - acceptor lms blended with different amounts of additive were observed by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) measurement. Fig. S6 † shows the XRD patterns of PBDTT-TT and PBDTT-TT-TEO. Both polymers show crystalline diffraction peaks at a low angle ( x 5.0 ) , which is attributed to a lamellar structure. The crystalline diffraction peak of PBDTT-TT-TEO is slightly sharper than that of PBDTT-TT , meaning that PBDTT-TT-TEO has a more ordered molecular packing structure , which is consistent with the UV observation.",

The improved PCE is related to the enhanced J sc and FF , which should arise from the more ordered molecular packing structure of PBDTT-TT-TEO , resulting in more efficient carrier transport in the active layer. To further improve the PCE , the device based on PBDTT-TT-TEO blended with PCB - TEO containing the same functional group was fabricated. Using this approach , the cooperative assembly of the TEO chains in both the donor and acceptor develops the ordered microphase - separation nanomorphology for PCE enhancement. Unexpectedly , the devices based on PBDTT-TT-TEO:PCB-TEO only obtained a low PCE of 2.8% with a dramatically reduced FF ( Fig. 3 and Table 3 ). The poor performance can be ascribed to the discontinuous lm morphology caused by the poor solubility of PCB - TEO in organic solvents , as revealed by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) observation ( Fig. S7 † ). Using a compatibilizer has been proven to be an effective approach to improve the formation of the D-A nanoscale interpenetrating network. Since the PCB - TEO did not perform satisfactorily as an acceptor in the PSCs owing to its poor solubility , it could be used as a compatibilizer in PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM blends to modify the nanostructure of the active layer. Considering that PCB - TEO contains the same segment as both PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCBM , the compatibility between the immiscible PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCBM can be enhanced via PCB - TEO , preferentially located at the donor and acceptor interface to span the heterojunction itself , consequently ensuring good miscibility in the system. The solar cell performance of the PBDTT-TT-TEO:PCBM:PCB-TEO ternary system is provided in Table 3 and Fig. 3.",

    "sentence": "As expected , with the addition of an appropriate amount of PCB - TEO into the PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM blend , the PCE of the device dramatically increases and the device with 5% loading of PCB - TEO achieves the highest PCE of 4.8% , with a J sc of 12.18 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.722 V and a FF of 55.0% . Compared to the PBDTT - TT : PCBM device , the PCB - TEO compatibilizer promotes approximately a 33% improvement in PCE , a 24% improvement in FF and a 10% improvement in J sc . The enhanced FF is associated with the remarkably improved R sh from 197.8 U cm^2 ( without a PCB - TEO compatibilizer ) to 469.4 U cm^2 ( with a PCB - TEO compatibilizer ). Further increasing the loading of PCB - TEO to 10% results in a sharp decrease in the overall parameters ( PCE = 4.0% , FF = 50.2% , J sc = 11.03 mA cm^-2 ) , except for the almost unchanged V oc which is mainly determined by the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. In addition , PCB - TEO was also incorporated into the PBDTT - TT : PCBM blends without TEO for comparison , and the corresponding performance is shown in Table S1 ( Fig. S8 ). † Due to the lack of TEO in the PBDTT-TT donor , the PCB - TEO compatibilizer can not serve the same role on PBDTT-TT as on PBDTT-TT-TEO. Therefore , the device only delivers a PCE of 3.2% for 3% loading of PCB - TEO and 2.7% for 5% loading of PCB - TEO. From the device performance , it can be concluded that incorporation of TEO into the donor and acceptor can result in an improved PCE by enhancing the J sc and FF. of PCBM is replaced by PCB - TEO , the absorption intensity further increases , and the blends with 5% and 10% of PCB - TEO present the strongest absorption at the solar ux region. This is because the PCB - TEO preferentially located at the donor and acceptor interface favors more ordered arrangements via the interaction between the same TEO side chains. The enhanced absorption peaks should be responsible for the enhanced J sc . No obvious distinction between X-ray diffraction patterns can be seen in Fig. 5 when blending the two polymers with PCBM. However , slightly increasing the loading of the PCB - TEO additive from 3% to 10% causes the crystalline diffraction peak at a low angle to become sharper and move to a higher angle. The result indicates that the cooperative assembly between PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCB - TEO can enhance the crystallinity of the polymer crystallites and cause tighter packing of the lamellar structure. The self - aggregation tendency induced by cooperative assembly of the TEO side chains is essential for transport of the holes and electrons.",

With the addition of 3% PCB - TEO into the lm , a better surface morphology with a reduced RMS roughness of 0.93 nm is developed , while the best - optimized morphology can be acquired with a RMS roughness of 0.51 nm for the lm with 5% PCB - TEO.

The smoothest lm with a RMS roughness of 0.36 nm is obtained from the blend with 10% loading of PCB - TEO. However , too much PCB - TEO leads to a large phase separation , as revealed by Fig. 6. Therefore , a sharp decrease in PCE is seen. For PBDTT - TT : PCBM , without the cooperative assembly of TEO side chains , adding only 3% PCB - TEO into the active layer produces a predominantly macrophase aggregation ( Fig. S9 † ) . The morphologies of the PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM and PBDTT-TT-TEO:PCBM:PCB-TEO ( 5% PCB - TEO ) lms are further investigated by planar transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( Fig. 7 ). The bright and dark parts represent the polymer - rich and PCBM - rich domains , respectively. The big PCBM clusters can be clearly distinguished from the dark areas in the TEM image of the PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM blend ( Fig. 7 ). In contrast , adding 5% PCB - TEO into the blend induces a homogeneous morphology of the polymer and PCBM with equal domain size. Therefore , from the device performance , light absorption and morphology , it is determined that incorporation of a TEO side chain into the active layer obviously improves the degree of ordering in the blend lm.",

    "sentence": "These four polymers show much different absorption edges at long wavelength direction , and the optical band gaps are 1.65 eV for PDTG - BDD , 1.52 eV for PDTG - IID , 1.41 eV for PDTG-BT , and 1.30 eV for PDTG - DPP. Generally speaking , PDTG-BT and PDTG - DPP exhibit broader absorption spectra in long wavelength region than PDTG - BDD and PDTG - IID , probably meaning that higher photocurrent densities may be obtained in the PSCs based on PDTG-BT and PDTG - DPP than the other two polymers. Moreover , as listed in Table 2 , the four DTGbased polymers exhibit relatively high and much similar absorption coefficients in film , which are all around 0.9 × 10^-2 / nm , implying they would have no shortage in absorption coefficients. PDTG - IID and PDTG-BT show narrower optical band gaps , comparing to their Si - bridged analogous ; 51,52 however , the optical band gaps of PDTG - DPP and PDTS - DPP are very similar. 48 Photovoltaic Properties , External Quantum Efficiency , and Mobility. The bulk - heterojunction PSC devices with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymers : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated to investigate photovoltaic properties of these four DTG - based polymers. The active layers were prepared in the solutions of o-DCB with the concentration of 10 mg / mL ( polymer / o-DCB ). Different spin speeds were used to control the thickness of the active layers of the PSC devices.

When 7% DIO was added , the J sc of the PDTG - BDD devices slightly increased from 8.66 to 10.3 mA / cm^2 , while the FF was significantly improved from 49.3% to 65.0% , so that the PCEs of the devices increased from 3.86% to 6.28% . For the PDTG - IID / PC71BM system , when 3% DIO was added , the J sc values was improved tremendously from 3.82 to 10.7 mA / cm^2 , so the PCE was improved from 1.24% to 4.07% . The performance of devices based on PDTG - IID / PC71BM are higher than PDTS - IID / PC71BM system. 49,52 The improvement of the efficiency comes from the increase of J sc of the devices , which probably attributes to higher hole mobility of the DTG - based polymers and more favorable phase separation morphology of blend films. 53 The photovoltaic properties of the PDTG-BT - based device is not very sensitive to the use of DIO ; i.e. , for the PDTG-BT - based devices with and without the use of DIO , similar PCE values were recorded. The devices based on PDTG-BT in this work show higher V oc and FF than those of the reported works , which might be due to the difference of the molecular weight ; i.e. , the M n of PDTG-BT in the reported work is 31 K ( PDI = 3.2 ) , while in this work , the M n is 2.14K only ( PDI = 7.23 ). 50 Unfortunately , although the polymer PDTG - DPP shows the broadest absorption spectrum in these four polymers and the corresponding devices show relatively good FF values ( FF = 60% ) , the PSC devices based on this polymer exhibit much lower J sc values than the devices based on the other three polymers.

    "sentence": "A simple approach was demonstrated to manipulate dipole moment of interlayer in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). The ionic liquid crystals ( ILCs ) 3-((2′-(4″-cyanobiphenyl-4yloxy)ethyl)dimethylammonio)propanesulfonate ( CbpNSO ) with zwitterionic charges were blended with cationic conjugated polyelectrolyte ( CPE ) poly [3-(6-trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophene] ( PTNBr ) to afford a novel CPE - ILC complex. The water / alcohol solubility of the CPE - ILC complex enables it to be green solvent processable. The spontaneous orientation of liquid crystal ( LC ) favors more ordered structural arrangement in CPE - ILC complexes. More importantly , LC - assistant assembly improves the orientation of dipole at cathode and significantly reduces the work function of ITO. The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of P3HT : PC 60 BM - based inverted PSCs with the layer of PTNBr - CbpNSO is increased by 37% with respect to that of the device with pure PTNBr. Incorporation of PTNBr - CbpNSO into the devices based on PBDTTT-C-T and PC71BM affords a notable PCE of 7.49% . It should be noted that mesogens reduce the activation energy of molecular reorganization and accelerate dipole orientation in CPE - ILC interlayer under external electric field , which enables the dipole of this interlayer can be readily manipulated. Because of the rapid orientation of the dipole , PTNBr - CbpNSO shows reversible dipole at the active layer / ITO interface during the reversible bias process . Research on bulk - heterojunction polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) has achieved tremendous progress during the past decade , due to their advantages of scalable printing manufacturing and low materials costs. 1 Power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs has successfully reached to 10% , with sophisticated design of novel light - harvesting polymers , usage of efficient device structures , development of new fabrication techniques , and incorporation of interfacial materials for electrode modification. 2 Interfacial materials play a crucial role in improving the performance of PSCs by favorable interfacial engineering , and an appropriate interfacial material could efficiently hamper the excitons recombination and lower the contact resistance at the light - harvesting layer / electrode interface. In addition , incorporation of interlayer can alter charge collection and selectivity by modifying the Fermi level alignment to either the E F,h of the donor or the E F,e of the acceptor for hole and electron transportation , respectively. Therefore , the altered polarity of electrodes by insertion of proper interlayer can result in two types of PSCs structures : conventional and inverted structures. 2f The inverted device with reversed polarity of electrodes , consisting of bottom indium tin oxide ( ITO ) as cathode and top high work function ( WF ) metal as anode , is an advantageous approach for practical commercialization of PSCs due to its superior long - term stability.",

    "sentence": "In addition , the absorption peak of the PTNBr - CbpNSO complex can achieve a further ∼ 10 nm red - shift after annealing the film from the mesophase states at 150 °C ( Figure S6 ). This reveals that liquid crystalline state annealing strengths spontaneous orientation property of LC to favor a more ordered assembly of CPE - ILC. The self - assembled structure formed by the CPE - ILC complex can be directly seen in the atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images shown in Figure 3 and Figure S7. The complex was spuncoated on ITO substrate and then annealed in the mesophase region. The thicknesses for these films are approximately 20 nm. The pure PTNBr provide a wave like film ( rms = 1.0 nm ). As shown in Figure 3 , the CbpNSO with zwitterionic side chain smoothes the morphology of PTNBr - CbpNSO with reduced rms of 0.5 nm. This phenomenon can be interpreted that PTNBr - CbpNSO with zwitterionic LC as a complexing agent can favor more ordered structures. Moreover , the electrostaticpairing effect between the two components can be evidenced in the phase images. The inner assembly morphology of the complex was also conducted by TEM. Different from homogeneous PTNBr , the PTNBr - CbpNSO complex forms elongated rodlike aggregates , verifying that cooperation assembly of CPE and ILC can generate rigid self - organized associations , 15 which may form long-range-ordered multilayers 15a , 16 and promote the efficient charge transport. To investigate the effect of this self - assembly between CPE and ILC on the energy level at metal / organic material interface , the Kelvin probe method was employed to directly measure the WF of the CPE , CPE-S , and CPE - ILC modified ITO electrode. 17 Figure 4 shows the WF images of the 10 nm thick CPE - ILC coated ITO after annealing from the liquid crystalline state for 10 min. The bare ITO exhibits a typical WF value of 4.93 ± 0.12 eV , in a good agreement with the literature. 2f The interfacial dipole formation at ITO / CPE interface leads to a reduction of WF by 0.4 eV after deposition of PTNBr on ITO , which can lower the Schottky barrier that is found to hamper the efficient electrons collection from the photoharvest layer to ITO at the ITO / PC 60 BM interface. 18 Replacing the pure PTNBr to the PTNBr-ZW complex with ZW surfactant , WF decreases to 4.40 eV. Although the electron transport to electrode is more favorable , the WFs of the PTNBr-ZW modified ITO are not low enough with respective to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of PC 60 BM ( 4.3 eV ) , and a Schottky contact still exists ( Figure 4 ).",

    "sentence": "Delightfully , the dipole moments of PTNBr - CbpNSO complexes lower the WFs to 4.02 ± 0.10 eV. A vacuum level shift of about 0.9 eV makes a substantial change in the work function of ITO , which sufficiently eliminates the barrier and forms an ohmic contact. Figures 1 and 3 demonstrate the probable mechanism for the decreased WF. The permanent dipole caused by the orientation of CPE at the ITO / polymer interface is the major reason for the WF shift in metal electrode surface. 17,19 The small - angle Xray scattering ( SAXS ) indicates the existence of ordered orientation in PTNBr film ( see Figure 4 ). The intensity of the scattering peak at ∼ 6.5 nm is increased by introducing these counterparts into polymer. The scattering of the pure PTNBr reveals a relatively weak peak at q ∼ 0.10 Å -1 , corresponding to a Bragg distance of about 6.0 nm. Upon addition of CbpNSO , the strong and sharp peaks with a d-space of ∼ 6.9 nm are observed , indicating the improved crystallinity of the film. Since the dipole is determined by the ionic chain orientation , the highly crystalline CPE - ILC film with ordered polar chains is preferable to form an aligned dipole moment. However , the pure PTNBr shows a relatively disordered dipole direction. As shown in Figure 4 , the alignment of ionized chains in the complex could form a dipole pointing away from ITO , ultimately resulting in the shifting of WF. The relationship between the ordering of CPE and magnitude of dipole is similar to the property of ferroelectric interlayer. 20 The WF reduction caused by enhanced orientation of dipole moment also increases the built-in field to break the electrical symmetry inside of the PSCs , consequently anticipating a V OC and J SC improvement. 21 The inverted PSCs based on these complexes were fabricated with the configuration of ITO / ETL / P3HT : PCBM / PE - DOT : PSS / Ag shown in Scheme S2. The CPE - ILC ( surfactant ) complex was deposited on ITO as a cathode interface modification layer. The transmittances of the ITO / CPE - ILC ( surfactant ) cathodes are almost identical to that of the bare ITO cathode , inferring that this ETL would not hinder the light - harvesting in the active layer ( Figure S8 ). Figure 4 presents the current density versus voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the inverted PSCs based on P3HT : PC 60 BM. Both complexes were optimized at the ultrathin thickness of 5-10 nm , enabling \" quantum tunneling \" for charge transport from the active layer to the ITO cathode ( Figure S9 and Table S1 ). 17 The device performance parameters are summarized in Table 1.",

    "sentence": "As shown in Figure 4 and Figure S10 , in comparison with the standard PSCs with pure PTNBr ETL exhibiting a relatively low PCE of 2.91% , the performance of the device using the PTNBr - CbpNSO ETL is dramatically improved with the average PCE approaching to 4.0% , giving 285% and 22% improvement over the two reference device with bare ITO and ITO / ZnO cathodes , respectively. The improved PCE of devices with CPE - ILC is the result of enhanced J SC and slightly improved V OC relative to the devices with pure PTNBr , suggesting the more favorable charge injection and collection are achieved at electrodes. In contrast , the devices based on PTNBr-ZW give the comparable performance just with slightly enhanced J SC to the standard PSC with pure PTNBr ETL. As a comparison , pure ILC ( surfactant ) was also used to modify the ITO cathode. As shown in Figure S11 and Table S2 , the highest PCE among these devices is below 3% , which is blamed on the low fill factor values ( less than 50% ) caused by the poor quality of these films. It can be concluded that only the LC favored electrostatic assembly with the PTNBr can promote the highly orientated dipole moment along with the induced built-in electric field , consequently enhancing the device performance. The similar results can be found in the devices with complex layer spin - coated from their DMSO solution ( see Figure S12 and Table S3 ). The improvement in these parameters can be mainly attributed to the enhanced orientation of dipole moment pointing out from ITO penetrating into the BHJ layer through the swift down of the vacuum level of the ITO cathode. 22 To further confirm the orientation dipole moment caused by the LC favored electrostatic assembly and testify the universality of CPE - ILC on common PSCs , inverted PSCs based on the lowbandgap polymer PBDTTT-C-T with these ETLs were fabricated by the ITO / ETL / PBDTTT-C-T : PC 70 BM / PE - DOT : PSS / Ag structure. As expected , the average efficiency of the devices can be improved greatly from 6.28% for pure PTNBr to 7.41% for PTNBr - CbpNSO with enhanced J SC and slightly improved V OC ( Table 2 and Figure S13 ).

    "sentence": "The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) values of the devices with PTNBr- CbpNSO complex are much higher than those standard devices without ILC , which is in agreement with the high value of J SC ( there are only less than 4% error between the calculated J SC value from the EQE and the J SC from J-V curves ; see Figure S13 and Table 2 ). The response enhancement of the EQE value at 300-400 nm when incorporation of CPE - ILC into this device is in accordance with the absorbance spectra of device ( see Figure S14 ). With the help of CPE - ILC , the PBDTTT-C-T : PC 70 BM - based inverted PSCs affords a top PCE of 7.49% , which approaches the reported performance of the conventional PSC with the low WF Ca / Al cathode. 11 The built-in electric field in the BHJ layer induced by the CPE - ILC complex is expected to facilitate the exciton dissociation and increase the photogenerated - carrier collection. 22a In order to evaluate the apparent charge carrier mobility in the active layer , J 0.5 -V characteristics of single charge carrier devices were measured using the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) model according to the Mott - Gurney equation ( detail of the mobility measurement is described in the Supporting Information ). 23 As plotted in Figure 5 , with respect to the device without ETLs , device with PTNBr ensures the apparent electron mobility and hole mobility increase from 1.33 × 10^-3 to 2.13 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and from 1.46 × 10^-4 to 3.13 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 at an applied voltage of 1 V , respectively.

The results reveal that the cooperation assembly between ILC and CPE can improve both electron and hole mobility of device with a more balanced charge transport. 24 A relative thick interlayer is helpful for the charge mobility and the maximum with thickness reaches to ∼ 20 nm , owing to the produced stronger built-in field in the BHJ layer ( Figure S15 ). However , too thick interlayer always increases the contact resistance to reduce device efficiency. 25 Thus , the device with appropriate CPE - ILC interlayer thickness in the range of 5-10 nm would balance the charge transport and resistance in the PSCs. The orientation of ILC that induces formation of a favorable dipole will be very sensitive to the internal electric field afforded by the inherent WF difference between two electrodes 22a due to the intrinsic response of the liquid crystals to the stimulations. To investigate the effect of the electric field on the dipole orientation , we applied positive and negative electric field to manipulate the dipole moment of the CPE - ILC interlayer in PSCs.",

Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) are potentially low cost , lightweight and compatibility with large scale solution processing. 1,2 They have been considered as an important part of renewable energy in the future. Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells are based on the blend of electron - donating conjugated polymers and electron - accepting fullerene derivatives such as PCBMs. 2 Recently , significant progresses have been made in both material syntheses and solar cell device fabrications. The power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of BHJ PSC devices have reached 8-10 % . 3-8 However , many high performance polymers for PSC applications have complicated structures. Arduous synthesis and expensive intermediates are frequently involved for obtaining small amount of materials. These difficulties may restrict or even prohibit the practical applications of some high performance materials. Therefore , the development of new polymers for highly efficient PSCs from readily available materials and concise chemical synthesis is still a big challenge. Isoindigo and expanded isoindigo are bis(oxindole) - containing compounds. They have become increasingly important as electron - deficient building blocks for donor / acceptor , low bandgap conjugated polymers. 9-12 The common features of indigoid polymers include low - lying frontier orbital energy levels , strongly absorbing in visible region , and good solubility after N-alkylation. 13,14 Some high - performance BHJ PSC devices with indigoid polymers as electron donors have been reported recently. 15-20 (Z)-3-(Thiophen-2-yl-methylene)indolin-2-one ( TEI ) is a 2-thienylmethylene derivative of oxindole. Unlike bis(oxindole) monomers , the TEI is an unsymmetrical monomer. The related 3-benzylidene and hetarylmethylene derivatives of oxindole have been synthesized and studied for the treatment of neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease recently. 21 However , a monooxindole-or hemiisoindigo - based structure has never been studied as a building block for conjugated polymers. Herein , we present the synthesis of TEI monomer and three new conjugated polymers based on this new building block.",

    "sentence": "The new polymers possess relatively low HOMO energy levels and broad absorption spectrum. The solar cell devices based on the TEI-thiophene polymer as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor achieved a PCE of 7.32% . Synthesis and Characterization of the Polymers. (Z)-6-Bromo-3-((5-bromothiophen-2-yl)methylene)indolin-2-one ( 1 ) was synthesized by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 6-bromooxindole and 5-bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde in the presence of piperidine ( Scheme1 ). Compound 1 showed poor solubility in common solvents such as acetone and ethyl ether. It was washed with methanol and ethyl acetate and was directly used in the next step. Compound 1 was N - alkylated with 9-(iodomethyl)nonadecane to give the monomer TEI , which was soluble in many organic solvents such as chloroform and acetone. The structure of the TEI was carefully studied by 1 NMR , 13 °C NMR and NOESY experiment ( Figures S1-S3 in Supporting Information ). The (Z)-isomer was confirmed as the only stereoisomer isolated in the condensation reaction. The assignment of stereostructure was consistent with some 1 H nuclear overhauser enhancement ( NOE ) study on the related compounds in the recent literature. 21,22 The monomer TEI was polymerized with bis(trimethylstannyl) functionalized thiophene ( T ) , bis(alkoxy)-BDT ( BDTO ) , and bis(alkylthienyl) - BDT ( BDTT ) monomers. The Stille cross-coupling polymerizations were carried out with a 1 : 1 monomer ratio in the presence of tris-(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium as catalyst , tri-o-tolylphosphine as ligand and toluene as solvent in Schlenk tubes at 65 °C . This reaction temperature was much lower than the temperature ( about 100 °C ) normally used for Stille crosscoupling reaction. We found that higher polymerization temperature could result insoluble product in this system. The reactions gave dark blue polymers. The crude polymers were purified by precipitating in methanol , washing with methanol and with hexane in Soxhlet extractors. The residues were extracted with hot chloroform and solvents were removed to give purified polymers. The polymer PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT showed good solubilities in solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. The new polymers were characterized by 1H NMR at elevated temperature ( Figures S5-S7 ) and by elemental analyses. The number - average molecular weights ( M n ) and polydispersity indexes ( PDIs ) of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using polystyrenes as standards and tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) as eluent. The results are listed in Table 1. The number - average molecular weights of PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT were 135.0 , 71.6 , and 24.4 kDa , respectively ; the polydispersity indexes of PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT were 1.3 , 2.0 , and 2.2 , respectively. The TEI is an unsymmetrical monomer. The Stille cross-coupling polymerizations of TEI and bis(trimethylstannyl) functionalized monomers likely give polymers with regiorandom main chains. These polymers could have different local dipole moment from polymers based on isoindigo.",

Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) measurements were carried out to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymers. The results are listed in the Table 1 and the TGA graphs are displayed in Supporting Information ( Figure S8 ). The temperature of 5% weight - loss was chosen as the Optical and Electrochemical Properties. The UV - vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform ( CF ) solution and as thin films are shown in Figure 1. The optical properties of the polymers are summarized in Table 2. The absorption maximum ( λ max abs ) of PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO and PTEI - BDTT in chloroform were at 615 nm ( ε = 2.78 × 10^5 M -1 cm^-1 ) , 576 nm ( ε = 1.22 × 10^5 M -1 cm^-1 ) , and 581 nm ( ε = 1.75 × 10^5 M -1 cm^-1 ) , respectively. Two BDT - based polymers showed similar shapes of the absorption bands in solution. The solution absorption spectrum of PTEI - BDTT was slightly red - shifted compared with that of PTEI - BDTO. However , the thiophene based polymer PTEI-T showed different absorption characteric from two BDT - based polymers. The absorption band of PTEI-T was significantly red - shifted compared to those of PTEI - BDTO and PTEI - BDTT. The PTEI-T also showed much larger extinction coefficients than the BDT - based polymers in the range from 525 to 725 nm. These phenomena can be attributed to the degrees of delocalization in the conjugated polymers. The π-electrons in the fused aromatic units such as BDT were less favorable to delocalize into the polymer backbone than those in a single thiophene ring because the fused aromatic structures possess large resonance stabilization energy compared with a single thiophene ring. 23 The redshifted absorption band and strong absorption of PTEI-T were highly favorable for effective solar photon harvesting and might lead to high photocurrent in PSC devices. From solution to thin - film , the absorption bands became broad for all three polymers. The absorption onsets of the PTEI - BDTO and PTEI - BDTT thin - films were only slightly red - shifted compared with their solution absorption onsets. However , the absorption onset of PTEI-T showed significantly red - shifted ( 27 nm ) from solution to thin - film. This bathochromic shift indicated the existence of ordered aggregations and strong π-π stacking interactions between the PTEI-T polymers in solid - state. 24 The The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) levels of the polymers were calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymer thin - films in cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) experiments.

The theoretical calculation using DFT ( B3LYP / 6-31G** level ) method was employed to study the electronic structures of these polymers. To simplify the calculations , long alkyl side chains were replaced by methyl groups. 29-31 The results are showed in Figure S9. It was found that the HOMOs of the polymers were distributed along the whole structures , while the LUMOs were localized at the TEI units. The dihedral angles between TEI and BDT were 11.86 ° i n TEI - BDTO and 9.92 ° in TEI - BDTT , while the dihedral angle between TEI and thiophene was 8.31 ° in TEI-T. The small dihedral angle in the TEI-T was beneficial for coplanarity of the polymer backbone and for interchain π-π stacking in solid state. Photovoltaic Properties of the Polymers. Polymer solar cell devices with polymer PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT as electron donors and PC61BM as electron acceptor were fabricated and tested ( Figure 3a , and Table 3 ).

The blend films showed large aggregations when spin - coated without DIO ( Figure 5a-c ). The large aggregations could result from the poor miscibility between donor polymers and PC61BM. The domain sizes were more than hundred nanometers. They were much larger than the scale of exciton diffusion. This could cause inefficient exciton dissociation. After addition of DIO ( 2% by volume ) , the aggregations in the blend films were suppressed and the domain sizes were significantly reduced ( Figure 5d-f ). The good miscibility and large interface area between the donor and acceptor were favorable for efficient exciton separation and charge transport which contributed to the enhancement of J sc and PCEs of PSCs.

    "sentence": "The alternative D-A type copolymers , P1 and P2 , were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction of 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene with 5 or 7 , respectively. Since a decrease in the solubility was expected by introducing the unsubstituted fivemembered ring of OXD and TD , the 3,4-dihexylthiophene units were incorporated. As a result , P1 and P2 were quite soluble in the common organic solvents such as THF , CHCl 3 , benzene , toluene , chlorobenzene , and o-dichlorobenzene. The number - average molecular weights and polydispersity indices ( M n , PDI ) of P1 and P2 determined by SEC in CHCl 3 with a calibration using polystyrene standards are ( 18^500 , 1.45 ) and ( 24^400 , 1.88 ) , respectively , as listed in Table 1. The results indicated that P1 and P2 possess adequate molecular weights. The SEC curves of P1 and P2 are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. Figure 2 shows the 1H NMR spectra of P1 and P2. In both cases , characteristic signals appear assignable to the 3-and 4-protons of the unsubstituted thiophene ring at 7.22 ppm ( P1 ) and at 7.23 ppm ( P2 ). In addition , the signals assignable to the methylene protons next to the thiophene ring can also be seen at 3.05 and 2.81 ppm ( P1 ) and at 2.92 and 2.80 ppm ( P2 ) , the intensities of which are reasonably compared to the ones of the signals for the 3and 4-protons of the unsubstituted thiophene ring. Thus , the above results suggest the successful synthesis of the target polymers. The thermal stability of the two polymers was investigated by TGA , as shown in Figure S2. The onset decomposition temperatures of P1 and P2 for a 5% weight loss are 403 and 393 °C , respectively ( see also Table 1 ) , indicating that the thermal stability of the two polymers is sufficient for application in optoelectronic devices. Optical and Electrochemical Properties. The UV - vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chlorobenzene are depicted in Figure 3a , which show the maximum absorption wavelength ( λ max ) at 423 nm ( P1 ) , 467 nm ( P2 ) , and 446 nm ( PDHBT ) , respectively. In the film states , the λ max values of both polymers bathochromically shift to 470 nm ( P1 ) , 513 nm ( P2 ) , and 510 nm ( PDHBT ) , respectively , indicating the structure ordering in these films ( see Figure 3b ). P1 has the λ max value in the wavelength region shorter than P2 because of less crystalline nature , as will be described later. In additional , P1 has a lower λ max value than PDHBT. From the Gaussian simulation ( Figure S3 ) , the studied polymers show almost planar structures , which the torsional angles are generally smaller than 1.5 ° . The result indicates there is no obvious steric hindrance to affect energy band gaps.",

    "sentence": "Hence , P2 and PDHBT have smaller band gap than P1 , probably due to the sulfur element having a larger atomic radius , more effectively hybridizing s and p orbitals , and being more polarizable , which are favorable for intermolecular interactions in thin films. 35 The calculated optical band gap ( E g opt ) values of P1 and P2 from the onset wavelengths of 542 nm ( P1 , film state ) and 591 nm ( P2 , film state ) are 2.29 and 2.10 eV , respectively. These results are summarized in Table 2 , and they indicate that P2 absorbs light more efficiently compared to P1 , which would be more preferable for the PSC performance. Furthermore , the absorption coefficients of the thin films of P1 ( 1.78 × 10^5 cm^-1 at ca. 470 nm ) , P2 ( 2.03 × 10^5 cm^-1 at ca. 513 nm ) , and PDHBT ( 1.89 × 10^5 cm^-1 at ca. 510 nm ) are comparable to that of the P3HT film ( 1.9 × 10^5 cm^-1 at ca. 552 nm ). 36 Also , by incorporating the TD electron acceptor into polymer main chain , P2 shows a higher absorption coefficient than PDHBT. The high absorption coefficient of P2 suggests its potential to enhance the PSC characteristics. The electrochemical CV ( Figure 4 ) of P1 and P2 was performed in acetonitrile at a potential scan rate of 0.1 V / s for determining their HOMO energy levels. The CV curves of the P1 and P2 films show the oxidation peaks with the onset 4 ). Note that the HOMO energy level is estimated using the following relation : HOMO = -e(E ox ( onset ) - E 1 / 2 ( ferrocene ) + 4.8 ) ( eV ). 37 It was found that both polymers possess lower HOMO energy levels than P3HT ( -4.88 eV as measured under the same conditions ) and PDHBT ( -5.22 eV 32 ) , which should be consistent with the high V oc values from the PSC characterization , as described below. The LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were determined to be -3.26 and -3.23 eV , respectively , by the calculation of LUMO = HOMO + E g opt . All the CV data are also summarized in Table 2. Morphological Characterization. DSC was used to investigate the possible crystallization of the prepared polymers. As shown in Figure 5 , there are distinct endothermic peaks for the T m values at 174 °C ( P1 ) and 217 °C ( P2 ) and corresponding exothermic peaks for the T c values at 140 °C ( P1 ) and 197 °C ( P2 ) , respectively , as listed in Table 1. It is obvious that P2 exhibits more distinct transition peaks than P1 , which may be caused by highly ordered packing structures. These data are summarized in Table 1. Figure 6 shows the TEM images of the thermally annealed P1 and P2 thin films.",

    "sentence": "The annealed P2 thin film shows a distinct organized nanofibrillar structure as compared to P1. The well - ordered nanofibrillar morphology of P2 could result in good charge carrier transporting characteristics. The GIXD analyses of the P1 and P2 thin films ( thickness of 40-50 nm ) were carried out to further investigate their structural ordering , as shown in Figure 7. Although the P1 film without annealing does not show a distinct diffraction peak except for the amorphous halo around 2θ = 21 ° , a new diffraction peak appeared at 2θ = 4.6 ° , corresponding to the d 1 spacing value of 19.2 Å after annealing at 100 ° C. In contrast , the P2 film exhibited a distinct diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.3 ° , corresponding to the d 1 spacing value of 20.5 Å without annealing. In addition , after annealing at 100 °C , the d 1 spacing value decreased to 18.4 Å , indicating more compact packing structures. Moreover , as compared to PDHBT ( Figure S4 ) , the studied polymers exhibit the smaller d 1 spacing ( P1 ( 19.2 Å ) and P2 ( 18.4 Å ) ) than PDHBT ( 24.5 Å ) after annealing. This result may be due to the acceptor moieties incorporated into the polymer backbone that enhances the D-A intramolecular charge transfer. All the results supported the fact that P2 shows the highest degree of crystalline nature , which well agrees with the optical property Besides , the nanofibrillar morphology of P2 is also observed in the tapping mode AFM phase images ( Figure S5 ). The ordered nanofibrillar structure of the P2 film with the interconnected networks of the polymer chains may allow the formation of highly efficient pathways for charge carrier transport. 38,39 Field Effect Transistor ( FET ) Characteristics. Solutionprocessed FETs based on P1 , P2 , and PDHBT were fabricated from chlorobenzene. All the FET devices were fabricated by employing a top - contact configuration for reducing the contact resistance. Figure 8 shows the FET transfer curves and output characteristics of the copolymer devices on the ODTS - modified SiO 2 . In the saturation region ( V d > V g - V t ) , I d can be described by the equation 40 μ = - I WC L V V 2 ( ) ds 0 g t 2 where W and L are the channel width and length , respectively , C 0 is the capacitance of the gate insulator per unit area ( SiO 2 , 300 nm , C 0 = 10 nF / cm^2 ) , μ is the hole mobility , and V t is the threshold voltage. The saturation - regime mobility was estimated from the slope of the plot of the drain - to - source current ( I d ) 1 / 2 as a function of the gate voltage ( V g ).",

    "sentence": "FET devices based on the polymer films were processed with and without annealing at 100 ° C. The corresponding carrier mobilities are listed in Table 3 , and the typical p - type transfer and output characteristics of the studied polymers are shown in Figure 8 and Figure S6. The average FET hole mobility ( μ ) value of P1 was determined to be 1.66 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 without annealing and increased to 1.41 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 after annealing with the high ON / OFF ratio of 7.8 × 10^5 . In contrast , P2 shows much higher average μ values of 4.82 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( without annealing ) and 8.81 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( after annealing ) than P1 , with an adequate ON / OFF ratio. For comparison , PDHBT without the electron - accepting OXD or TD moiety shows a μ value of 2.10 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 after annealing ( Figure S6 ) , which is in good agreement with the value in the literature 33 and is lower than that of either P1 or P2. This result indicated that the incorporation of the electronacceptor moieties efficiently enhances the charge transport due to the D-A intramolecular charge transfer as well as the compact packing structure , as demonstrated by the GIXD characteristics. In addition , all the studied polymers showed higher mobility after thermal annealing because of the molecular packing was enhanced as evidenced by GIXD results. In particular , the maximum mobility of P2 after annealing reached 0.12 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( average : 8.81 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) , which is comparable to that of P3HT. These results are correlated with the more crystalline and ordered nanofibrillar morphology of P2 than either P1 or PDHBT , as previously described. The high threshold voltage of P1 probably comes from its very low HOMO energy levels ( -5.55 eV ) , leading to a high energy barrier for hole injection. Polymer Solar Cell Characteristics. The structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 30 nm ) / polymer : PCBM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) / Ca ( 30 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ) was fabricated for the PSC characterization under the AM 1.5 G illumination condition ( 100 mW cm^-2 ).

The PSC characteristics , including the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) , of the P1 , P2 , and PDHBT devices are summarized in Table 4.",

    "sentence": "For P1 , the high V oc values ( 0.81 - 0.90 V ) are attributed to their low HOMO energy levels ; however , the J sc values are very low at less than 1 mA / cm^2 , resulting in the low PCE of 0.28% . This is because P1 inefficiently absorbs light and its hole mobility is lower than P2 , derived from less ordered packing structures that prevents separated charge generation and smooth charge transportation. Unfortunately , changing the film thickness as well as the annealing process does not improve PCE. In a sharp contrast , P2 shows much improved J sc values of 4.57 - 6.60 mA / cm^2 , while maintaining the high V oc values ( 0.80 - 0.86 V ) due to efficient light harvesting , high hole mobility , and low HOMO energy levels. As a result , the highest PCE ( 3.04% ) could be achieved with a V oc value of 0.80 V , a J sc value of 6.60 mA / cm^2 , and a FF value of 0.576 after optimization of the solvent and spin rate for casting the polymers ( see Figure 9 ). It should be mentioned that the value of 0.80 V of V oc and the value of 6.60 mA / cm^2 of J sc of P2 are higher than those of the PDHBT : PCBM BHJ PSC devices due to its low - lying HOMO levels and high field - effect hole mobility , leading to a higher PCE for P2 ( 3.04% ) than for PDHBT ( 1.91% ). These results demonstrate that the incorporation of the TD acceptor units into the thiophenebased polymer main chain lowers the HOMO energy levels as well as enhances the charge transporting to achieve a high PCE of the devices. Furthermore , the PCE of over 3% is the first observation using TD - incorporated π-conjugated polymers in PSC applications. However , the annealing process decreases the PCE of P2 , even though the hole mobility increases after annealing as previously described. There is no clear explanation for this result at the present time , but the morphological change , such as aggregation , might occur after annealing , which generally causes a reduction in the interface areas of the p - type and n - type domains to limit the charge separation. Figure 10 shows the photocurrent action spectra of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 30 nm ) / polymer : PCBM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) / Ca ( 30 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ) devices , in which P1 , P2 , and PDHBT ( reference ) are compared. All the devices exhibited a relatively broad photoresponse between 300 and 620 nm ( 300-550 nm for P1 ) , indicating that the absorption of the polymer : PCBM blends reflects the photocurrents in these wavelength regions.",

    "sentence": "Six novel conjugated copolymers ( P1-P6 ) containing coplanar cyclopentadithiophene ( CPDT ) units ( incorporated with bithiazole / thienyl-based monomers ) were synthesized and developed for the applications of polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). Copolymers P1-P6 covered broad absorption ranges from UV to near - infrared ( 400-800 nm ) with narrow optical band gaps of 1.70 - 1.94 eV , which are compatible with the maximum solar photon reflux. Partially reversible p-and n - doping processes of P1-P6 in electrochemical experiments were observed. Compared with those previously reported CPDT - based narrow band gap polymers , the proper molecular design for HOMO / LUMO levels of P1-P6 induced relatively high photovoltaic open - circuit voltages in the PSC devices. Powder X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) analyses suggested that these copolymers formed highly selfassembled π-π stackings. Under 100 mW / cm^2 of AM 1.5 white - light illumination , bulk heterojunction PSC devices containing an active layer of electron donor copolymers P1-P6 blended with electron acceptor [6,6]phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) in the weight ratio of 1 : 1 were explored , and the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) measurements showed a maximal quantum efficiency of 60% . The PSC device containing P4 in the weight ratio of 1 : 2 with PCBM gave the best preliminary result with an overall power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.04% , an open - circuit voltage of 0.70 V , a short - circuit current of 8.00 mA / cm^2 , and a fill factor of 53.7% . Extensive researches in the field of electro-optical devices have been focused on soluble π-conjugated semiconducting polymers , especially for the developments of organic photovoltaic ( OPV ) devices , which offer the advantages of lightweight , high - throughput , and environmentally renewable energy for future applications. Since the pioneering achievements of A. J. Heeger and co-workers in 1995 , 1 the so - called bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) concept has significantly improved the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) values of the OPV devices , where interpenetrating electron donor - acceptor ( D-A ) networks were formed by blending phaseseparated π-conjugated polymers ( as electron donors ) with soluble fullerenes , strong electron - affinity polymers , 2 or n - type nanocrystals 3 ( as electron acceptors ). For the electron - donating purpose , an increasing interest for novel polymeric materials with high charge carrier mobility and good processability has recently been found in thiophene - based conducting copolymers , such as derivatives of region - regular poly(3-hexylthiophene)s ( P3HTs ) , 4 polythiophenes , 5 and fused heterocyclic conjugated polymers , 6 etc. , resulting in OPV devices with the highest PCE value approaching 5.0% .

All copolymers were thermally stable up to 363-398 ° C upon heating and showed T g values over 120 °C , except that the phase transition temperatures of P1 and P6 were not observed by DSC. The detectable melting temperatures ( T m ) and crystallization temperatures ( T c ) of copolymers P4 and P5 suggested the higher ordering capabilities of P4 and P5 for their potential applications in organic solar cells , since the formation of phase - separated ordered nanostructures in the photovoltaic layer was desirable for charge transport and separation. 21,22 Optical properties.

The photophysical properties of the D-A copolymers ( P1-P6 ) based on CPDT-BT units are illustrated in Table 2. As expected , by tuning the numbers of the conjugated heterocyclic rings and electron donor - acceptor compositions , the conjugation lengths of the copolymers will be affected , which will also influence the absorption spectra of P1-P6 effectively ( in both solutions and solid films ). For instance , due to the presence of a more extended and delocalized π-electron system by increasing the number of the donor thiophene ( Th ) ring , an obvious red - shifted absorption of copolymer P5 was observed compared with that of copolymer P4 in both solutions and solid films. Furthermore , copolymer P6 containing electron - accepting cyano groups showed the longest absorption wavelength among all copolymers in solu- tions. However , the numbers of BT acceptor units in copolymers P1-P3 affected the absorption maxima in solutions and solid films by different ways. Surprisingly , a blue - shifted absorption in solutions was observed by increasing the number of BT units in solutions of P1-P3 , which might be due to the twist of polymer main chains by the BT units with alkyl side - chains. Nevertheless , due to the enlarged full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) values from P1 to P3 , a blue - shifted absorption in solid films of P1-P3 was observed ; but their optical band gaps ( in solid films ) had been reduced from 1.94 eV of P1 to 1.83 eV of P3. Even though the numbers of the conjugated rings in both P2 and P4 or both P3 and P5 are the same , the electron donor ( Th ) and acceptor ( BT ) units still have some influences on copolymers P2 - P5.",

It is widely accepted that optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers are predominantly determined by the conjugated main chains. [14][15][16] Although alkyl side chains are inert in opto - electronics , they can affect solubility , solid - state packing behaviours and blend morphology of polymer donors. [17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] Great efforts have been devoted to optimize the type , length , and branching point of alkyl side chains for excellent PSC device performance.

P-OEG exhibits strong diffraction peak at 24.4 o , corresponding to the π-π stacking distance of polymer backbone ( d π-π ) of 0.364 nm ( Table 2 ). In comparison , the d π-π of P-Alkyl is estimated to be 0.376 nm. The d π-π of P-OEG is smaller than that of P-Alkyl. As discussed in our previous paper , this is due to the more flexibility of OEG chains compared to alkyl chains. 50,51 Photophysical and Electrochemical Properties. Fig. 2 shows the UV - Vis absorption spectra of P-OEG and P-Alkyl in chloroform solution and in thin film. The characteristics are listed in Table 2. P-OEG and P-Alkyl exhibit similar absorption spectra in solution because of their identical conjugated main chain. In thin film , the absorption spectrum of P-OEG redshifts by 14 nm compared to that of P-Alkyl. This is attributed to the decreased d π-π of P-OEG , which leads to improved interaction of polymer main chains. As listed in Table 2 , the optical band gaps ( E g ) of P-OEG is 1.54 eV , which is smaller than that of P-Alkyl ( E g = 1.62 eV ).",

The device characteristics are listed in Table 3 Active Layer Morphology. To further elucidate the different photovoltaic performances of the two polymers , we investigate the active layer morphology of the four devices using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) in tapping mode and bright - field transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ). Fig. 6 shows the TEM images of the active layers of the four devices. Without the DIO solvent additive , both the films of P-OEG:PC71BM and P-Alkyl:PC71BM exhibit large - size phase separation with isolated PC71BM domains ( dark regions in TEM images ) of about 300 nm. The domain size is much larger than that ( 10 nm-20 nm ) required for bulk heterojunction PSCs and leads to ineffective exciton dissociation and low J SC . Application of DIO solvent additive leads to significantly decreased phase separation size , which is in accordance with the much increased J SC of the devices processed with DIO. In comparison , the P-OEG:PC71BM blend processed with DIO solvent additive exhibits much finer phase separation than that of P-Alkyl:PC71BM. This is consistent with the better PSC device performance of the P-OEG:PC71BM blend than that of P-Alkyl:PC71BM. The intimate mixing P-OEG:PC71BM blend may be attributed to the increased surface energy of P-OEG , which leads to good miscibility with PC71BM. Fig. 7 shows the AFM height images of the four active layers. AFM results also supports the well mixed phase separation morphology of the P-OEG:PC71BM blend than that of P-Alkyl:PC71BM when processed with DIO solvent additive.

The results show that both the nature of pendant side chains and the electron acceptor strength of the acceptor moiety of D-A polymers have critical impacts on material and photovoltaic properties. Better π-π stacking of polymer backbones enabled by appropriate substituents such as fluorine atoms and branched alkyl chains leads to a reasonably high power conversion efficiency of over 6% when the polymer is utilized as a donor material with PC71BM as an active layer in bulk heterojunction solar cells . Over the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted considerable attention owing to their unique advantages which include potentially low manufacturing cost , lightweight characteristics , and device structural flexibility , 1-7 to name a few. Currently the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) architecture is commonly adopted in PSC devices for its easier fabrication , more efficient charge separation , and potentially higher power conversion efficiency ( PCE ). In a typical BHJ architecture , the active layer generally consists of an electron - accepting fullerene derivative dispersed in an electron - donating conjugated polymer matrix. 8 An illustrative example is an active layer composed of a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) and methanofullerene-6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ). This system has been extensively studied in BHJ PSC with a PCE of about 4-5 % . However , the narrow absorption spectral properties and high HOMO level of P3HT are the major drawbacks for further improvement of device efficiency. 9-12 To overcome this problem , considerable studies have been directed toward development of low - band gap polymers and device optimization. 13 Common design considerations for efficient low - band gap polymers for BHJ PSCs can be generalized as follows : ( 1 ) reasonable solution - processability to enable excellent thin - film formation with electron accepting materials ( e.g. , PCBM ) ; ( 2 ) good matching of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels between the polymer and fullerene derivatives to facilitate efficient excition dissociation and charge transfer ; ( 3 ) a low - band gap ( 1.3 - 1.9 eV ) to harvest more solar energy. One common strategy for low - band gap polymer design is use of alternating electron donor and acceptor ( D-A ) polymer structure , which provides flexibility in tuning the energy levels of the polymer through its constituent donor and acceptor strengths. Several D-A polymers of this nature have been reported to achieve PCE of over 8% in BHJs. 14 Among various D-A polymers , benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole-(BT-) based polymers have been actively studied as donor materials for BHJ PSCs.",

Significant amount of work has subsequently been conducted on BT modification to improve polymer 's solar energy harvesting capability. These modified structures include , for example , benzobisthiadiazole , 19,20 [1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4-g]quinoxaline 21 and naphtho [1,2-c:5,6-c]bis [1,2,5]thiadiazole. 22 Most recently , fluorinated benzothiadiazole - based D-A polymers have been demonstrated to be promising electron - donor polymers for BHJ PSCs , providing PCE ranging from about 4% to over 7% . 23-26 The incorporation of fluorine atom appears to be advantageous in two respects : ( 1 ) it lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , resulting in an increased open voltage ( V oc ) ; ( 2 ) it provides inter or intramolecular F-H bonding , which help facilitate better π-π stacking leading to a greater extent of backbone ordering. In this article , we report the synthesis , characterization , and photovoltaic studies of novel 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole - based D-A polymers PFBT-T12TT and PFBT-T20TT ( see Scheme 1 ) , respectively with pendant straight and branched long alkyl chain substitutions. An analogous polymer based on nonfluorinated benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole has been reported to give a PCE of 0.42% . 27 Our investigation shows that both branched alkyl chain and fluorine substitutions are important for achieving high PCEs. Branched alkyl substituents are critical in improving polymer processability for fabrication of good thin films while the fluorine substitution enhances the intermolecular interaction. On the other hand , with straight alkyl chain substitution , the polymer suffers from limited solubility and thus difficult processability. Specifically , PFBT-T20TT exhibits strong broad absorptions and enhanced intermolecular polymer chain interaction in its thin film state. When used as the donor material and blended with PC71BM to form an active layer in BHJ devices , high PCE of over 6% was obtained. For comparison , BHJ devices with various different donor systems were fabricated and evaluated under the same condition. The results clearly revealed that much higher photovoltaic performance can be achieved by devices based on PFBT-T20TT than those from PBT-T12TT and PFBT-T12TT. Consequently , the incorporation of fluorine atom and long branched side chains in polymer backbone would be a viable strategy for designing desirable polymer donors for BHJ PSC application .

Bromination of 1 or 2 with NBS afforded respectively the corresponding bromides 3 or 4 , which was used in subsequent polymerization. Purifications of the crude polymers were effected by Soxhlet extraction sequentially with methanol and hexane to remove low molecular weight impurities and then with chlorobenzene to extract the polymer product.",

On the other hand , polymer PFBT-T20TT showed significantly better solubility and a dramatically improved yield of 65% was obtained. PFBT-T20TT was soluble in warm chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene but has limited solubility in chloroform and THF.

The absorptions of both the fluorinated polymers , PFBT-T12TT and PFBT-T20TT , were red - shifted compared to those of the nonfluorinated polymer , PBT-T12TT , an optoelectronic effect arising from the electron withdrawing fluorine substitution. The fluorinated polymer , PFBT-T20TT , also displayed an obvious shoulder peak at ∼ 640 nm. This shoulder absorption was absent in the spectrum of PFBT-T12TT , indicating some degree of short - range π-π stacking of polymer chains of PFBT-T20TT even in solution. In thin - film spectra , the absorptions of PBT-T12TT and PFBT-T12TT were red - shifted from those in solution , suggesting aggregation and higher ordering in the solid state. A shoulder peak at ∼ 690 nm was also observed for PFBT-T12TT , implying better packing in its solid state compared to its nonfluorinated analogue , PBT-T12TT. Surprisingly , the thin - film spectrum of PFBT-T20TT was almost identical to its solution spectrum. This would suggest that the ordering states for the polymer remained relatively similar in both solution and solid state. This was likely due to the to the steric effects of the bulky branched alkyl chain substituents which severely limited the polymer from achieving higher ordering in the solid state from that in solution. However , when temperature was raised from room temperature to 250 °C , a bathochromic shift of around 10 nm could be observed in PFBT-T20TT film absorption , indicating an improved π-π stacking attained in the polymer chains.

BHJ PSCs were fabricated with a general device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PFBT-T20TT:PC71BM / Ca / Al and the performance was measured under 100 mW / cm^2 AM 1.5 G illumination. The ratio of PFBT-T20TT to PC71BM was adjusted from 1 : 1 to 1 : 4 ( w : w ). Repeated measurements were performed on the devices. The current density - voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency of devices are shown in Figure 3 , parts a and b. The device performance data are shown in Table 2. As can be noted , the optimized polymer to PC71BM ratio was about 1 : 2 when a V oc of 0.82 V , a J sc of 12.93 mA / cm^2 , and FF of 60.9% were obtained , delivering a best PCE of 6.3% and an average PCE of 5.55% .

Device performance was characterized by J-V curves and EQE measurements as shown in Figure 4 , and the characterization data are summarized in Table 3. The results clearly show that under the same fabrication conditions , the PFBT-T20TT - based devices achieved the highest PCE of 3.3% as compared to those based on PBT-T12TT and PFBT-T12TT , which exhibited PCEs of only 0.57% and 0.02% respectively. The dramatically improved device performance of PFBT-T20TT could be attributed to its broader spectral absorption coverage. The absorptions of PFBT-T20TT were red - shifted by approximately 170 nm from those of the nonfluorinated polymer ( PBT-T12TT ) , and extended to the near IR region , resulting in more efficient solar energy harvesting. On the other hand , while the absorption spectrum of PFBT-T12TT was equally broad in the visible light region , it yielded poor device performance with very low PCE. This apparent anomaly may be attributable to the poor solubility of PFBT-T12TT. On the other hand , although PFBT-T12TT has a lower HOMO level than PFBT-T20TT , the V oc of its corresponding device is smaller than the latter one.",

    "sentence": "Although the tetracyclic angular - shaped naphthodithiophenes ( aNDTs ) derivatives are an emergent building block for constructing promising semiconductor conjugated polymers , the absence of aliphatic side chains as solubilizing groups on the aNDTs greatly restricted their further application toward polymer synthesis. To create a new class of aNDT - based polymers for widespread applications in solution - processable OFETs and PSCs , side - chain engineering of the aNDT - based structures plays a pivotal role in improving solubility and optimizing electronic / steric properties associated with the resultant solar cell characteristics. In this research , we developed an efficient and straightforward methodology to construct the angular naphthodithophene core with regiospecific introduction of two aliphatic chains at its 4,9-positions via a base - induced double 6π-cyclization. For the first time , the corresponding 2,7-distannylated-4,9-dialkylated aNDT monomers were polymerized with FBT and DPP acceptors to make two new PaNDTDTFBT and PaNDTDPP donor - acceptor copolymers. The photovoltaic devices based on the PaNDTDTFBT : PC71BM blend not only showed a promising PCE of 6.52% with conventional configuration but also achieved a higher PCE of 6.86% with inverted configuration. Moreover , PaNDTDPP with strong intermolecular interaction achieved a high FET hole mobility of 0.202 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Donor - acceptor ( D-A ) copolymers have been extensively utilized in organic photovoltaics ( OPVs ) and organic fieldeffect transistors ( OFETs ) due to their easy tunability of molecular properties and excellent solution processability. A variety of novel electron - rich conjugated building blocks have thus been developed for polymerization. Compared to the tricyclic benzodithiophene derivatives representing the most successful component for constructing high - performance D-A copolymers of OPVs , the tetracyclic naphthodithiophenes ( NDTs ) also attract growing attention considering their extended conjugation as well as diverse structures. Depending on the molecular geometry , the NDT derivatives can have linear - shaped ( lNDT ) and angular - shaped ( aNDT ) isomeric structures ( Figure 1 ). It was found that aNDT - based copolymers have higher ordered structures than the lNDTbased copolymers , thereby achieving higher OFET mobilities. Furthermore , the aNDT molecules exhibit lower - lying HOMO energy levels than the lNDT counterparts , which are beneficial for better air stability and greater open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) for OPVs. To fully exploit the aNDT - containing polymers for the optoelectronic applications , side - chain engineering by introducing solubilizing groups onto an aNDT framework is highly essential to not only ensure the solution processability but also induce suitable molecular packing. To address the issue , Takimiya and Osaka first introduced two alkyl groups at the outer positions ( 5,10-positions ) of the central naphthalene moiety in the aNDT. Compared to the polymer incorporating the unsubstituted aNDT units , the 5,10-dialkyl aNDT - based copolymer showed a better solubility and orientational order , leading to an impressive power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) over 8% . Li et al. reported a 4,9-dialkoxy aNDT - based D-A copolymer delivering moderate solar cell performances.",

    "sentence": "It is thus desirable to further create another isomeric structure , 4,9-dialkyl-aNDT , to investigate the substituent effects on the electronic and structural properties of the resulting copolymers. In this regard , we have developed a useful methodology to regiospecifically implant two alkyl chains at the inner 4,9-positions of an aNDT unit. By using this synthetic strategy , two 4,9-di(2-octyldodecyl) aNDT ( aNDT-OD ) and 4,9-di(2butyloctyl) aNDT ( aNDT-BO ) units were successfully synthesized. The two corresponding distannylated aNDT ( Sn-aNDT ) monomers were copolymerized with 4,7-bis(5bromo-4-octylthiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole ( DTFBT ) and 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) acceptors to prepare two PaNDTDTFBT and PaNDTDPP copolymers , respectively ( Figure 1 ). Their molecular properties have been carefully characterized , and bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells incorporating the polymers have exhibited promising photovoltaic performance in both conventional and inverted architectures . The synthesis of the monomers Sn-aNDT is described in Scheme 1. The molecular weight of PaNDTDTFBT ( M n = 67.8 kDa ; PDI = 1.2 ) and PaNDTDPP ( M n = 23.1 kDa ; PDI = 3.1 ) was determined by GPC measurements in THF. The thermal stability of two polymers was measured by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ). PaNDTDTFBT and PaNDTDPP showed sufficiently high decomposition temperatures ( T d ) of 447 and 429 °C , respectively ( Figure 2 ). According to the differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) analysis , PaNDTDPP does not show obvious melting point ( T m ) while PaNDTDTFBT exhibits crystalline nature with the observation of a T m at 300 °C during heating and a crystallization point ( T c ) at 280 °C upon cooling ( Figure 3 ). Two - dimensional wide - angle X-ray diffraction ( 2D-WAXD ) was employed to investigate the crystallinity of two polymers which were extruded as a fiber at 250 °C in the solid state. The results are shown in Figure 4. Diffraction arcs were distinctly observed in PaNDTDTFBT ( Figure 4a ). However , only diffraction rings were observed in PaNDTDPP ( Figure 4b ) , implying that PaNDTDTFBT possesses a more ordered and closer backbone structure than PaNDTDPP , and hence the higher π-stacking crystallinity. The crystalline nature of PaNDTDTFBT is also consistent with the observation of a T m at 300 °C from its DSC curve. The absorption spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure 5. Both of the polymers exhibited two distinct bands in the absorption spectra. Compared to PaNDTDTFBT showing the absorption maxima at 600 nm in the solution and the solid state , PaNDTDPP exhibited the apparent bathochromic shift of the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) band at 728 nm and showed a tailing of the absorption band with a shoulder around 850 nm in the thin film , which comes from the strong intermolecular interactions.",

    "sentence": "The optical band gaps ( E g opt ) calculated from the absorption edges of the solid state spectra are determined to be 1.70 eV for PaNDTDTFBT and 1.38 eV for PaNDTDPP. These results suggest that the electron - withdrawing ability of the DPP is stronger than that of the FBT unit. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was used to examine the electrochemical properties and evaluate the HOMO / LUMO levels and the electronic band gaps of the polymers ( Table 1 and Figure 6 ). The two polymers showed stable and reversible processes in the oxidative scans , which are important prerequisites for p - type organic semiconductors. The deep - lying HOMO energy levels were estimated to be -5.47 eV for PaNDTDTFBT and -5.34 eV for PaNDTDPP. It is worth noting that compared to the alkoxy substituents , the less donating alkyl groups at the 4,9-positions of the aNDT could lower the HOMO levels of the aNDTbased copolymers. On the other hand , the LUMO energy levels are approximately located at -3.50 eV for PaNDTDTFBT and -3.64 eV for PaNDTDPP , which are higher than the LUMO level of the PC71BM ( -3.8 eV ) to ensure energetically favorable electron transfer. The electron densities are homogeneously distributed along the molecular backbone in the HOMOs but located at the FBT or the DPP acceptor regions in the LUMOs , indicating distinct intramolecular charge transfer between donor and acceptor upon excitation. The energy of HOMO-LUMO transition is calculated to be 705 nm for aNDTDTFBT and 739 nm for aNDTDPP , which are in acceptable agreement with their experimental ICT absorption ( 650 and 730 nm in ODCB , respectively ). The hole mobilities were calculated from the transfer characteristics of the devices in the saturation regime. The OFET devices used SiO2 as gate dielectric whose surfaces were modified with octadecyltrichlorosilane ( ODTS ) to form a self - assembled monolayer ( SAM ). The hole mobility of the PaNDTDTFBT device is 4.7 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with an on - off ratio of 1.0 × 10^5 . Moreover , PaNDTDPP flanked with the shorter 2-butyloctyl groups at the aNDT core possesses highest hole mobility , reaching 0.202 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with a on - off ratio of 1.0 × 10^4 , which is attributed to the strong π-π stacking of the polymer backbone associated with the rigid and coplanar structure of the aNDT units ( Table 3 ). Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated on the basis of traditional ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PCBM / Ca / Al conventional configuration. The current density - voltage characteristics of the devices under simulated 100 mW cm^-2 AM 1.5 G illumination are shown in Figure 9 , and all the device parameters are shown in Table 4.",

    "sentence": "BHJs solar cell devices were fabricated using the conventional architecture of ITO / poly ( 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene ) : poly(styrenesulfonate) ( PEDOT : PSS ) / polymer : [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) / LiF / Al. Fig. 6 showed the current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves , and the photovoltaic data of the devices are summarized in Table 3. All the active layers were spin - coated from DCB , and the D / A blend ratio by weight ( polymer / PC71BM ) was 1 : 1.5. For PDPP , a moderate PCE of 1.70% was achieved , with a J sc of 4.81 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.78 V , and a FF of 45% . Diphenyl-DPP-co-BDT based polymers usually showed a poor photovoltaic performance , as reported by Patil and co-workers. 33 The low J sc is the major limiting factor. This is because the DPP core has steric interactions with the adjacent phenyl groups , producing a twisted molecular geometry to prevent strong intermolecular π-π interactions and weaken the ability for the materials to crystallize , resulting in low charge carrier mobilities. 34 The large optical bandgaps ( ~ 2 eV ) is another important factor limiting the J sc . It was found that after monofluorination on the phenyl units , the J sc dropped from 4. when compared to non-fluorinated analogues. 16,32 All these polymers exhibited a similar V oc , no improvement was realized by fluorination. Among all the polymers , Pm - fDPP exhibited the highest V oc of 0.83 V , which was only improved by 0.05 V comparing to PDPP. Similar to V oc , fluorination showed little influence on the FF , and the maximum value of 50% appeared at Pm - ffDPP - based device. It is clear that J sc appeared to have the greatest influence on the device performance , so PCEs showed a similar trend as the J sc : PDPP > monofluorinated polymers > difluorinated polymers. The fluorination of DPP units leads to more twisted dihedral angles between the phenyl units and DPP cores , which further blocks interchain interactions. This should be the major reason for the reduced device performances. It was interesting to note that meta-fluorinated polymers exhibited slightly higher PCEs than that of ortho-fluorinated polymers. This may be partially ascribed to the increased backbone coplanarity and red - shifted absorption as discussed above. We tried to optimize devices by adding 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) additive. However , the resultant devices showed an even lower PCE values. Details can be found in Table S2 .

    "sentence": "Three novel asymmetric thiophene / benzothiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymers with different π bridges , designated as PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT , were designed , synthesized and applied to organic solar cells. Compared with reported thiophene / pyridine-flanked DPP , thiophene / benzothiophene-flanked DPP polymers exhibited narrower band gaps below 1.5 eV , leading to broadened absorption ranging from 500 nm to 850 nm. All polymers displayed promising ambipolar semiconducting properties. PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT showed hole mobilities of 1.20 , 1.68 and 1.50 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. Their corresponding electron mobilities were 0.40 , 0.14 and 0.35 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Interestedly , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT also showed ambipolar properties in organic solar cells. Photovoltaic device based on PBTTDPP-TT as donor material reached a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.96% with PC71BM as an acceptor , while this device as the acceptor material achieved 0.28% with poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) as the donor. By contrast , PCE of PBTTDPP-2FBT - based devices reached 5.62% with PC71BM and 0.44% with P3HT. These results suggest that adoption of asymmetric flankers in DPP polymers can effectively tune their ambipolar transporting properties for high - performance organic electronic devices . Organic solar cells ( OSCs ) , which can supply clean and low - cost energy and are versatile in complex surroundings , have attracted much attention. 1-3 1-3 1-3 Power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) with polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors have been reported to reach above 11% . [4][5][6] However , the disadvantages of fullerene derivatives are high cost , instability and limited spectral to short wavelength region , are difficult to overcome. The design criterion of a donor molecule , that is , to achieve a low highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) to cater to the energy levels of PC71BM , is difficult to modulate. In addition , donors with low - lying HOMO levels contradicts a sufficient LUMO level offset between donors and fullerene derivatives. 7 Exploitation of non-fullerene molecular acceptors , such as ITIC and its derivatives , delivered the highest power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of OSCs. These studies suggest non-fullerene acceptors present promising alternative for future OSC devices. [8][9][10][11] OSCs based on polymer donors and ITIC - derivative acceptors have exhibited PCEs of more than 13% . [8][9][10][11] The design and synthesis of new nonfullerene polymer acceptors is another strategy towards all - polymer solar cells , which is more competitive in processing properties and thermal stability. [15][16][17] Electron mobility is a critical parameter of polymer acceptors , 3 whilst polymers with ambipolar transport properties could lead to unique exciton and charge transport process. Osaka et al. and Li et al. reported that polymers with building blocks of dithienylthienothiophenebisimide and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) could be versatile as donor or acceptor in OSCs. This finding uncovered ambipolar polymer could fulfill both as acceptor or donor in OSCs.",

DPP - based polymers have been widely studied in OFETs and OSCs because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and exceptional exciton / charge mobilities. [14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The broad absorption range of DPP - based polymers can facilitate an effective absorption of the low energy photons , which would enhance the value of short circuit current J sc in OSCs . λ onset a ) [nm] E H b ) [eV] E L exp c ) [eV] E g exp d ) [eV] E H cal e ) [eV] E L cal f ) [ eV HOMOs of -4.73 , -5.09 and -5.29 eV , respectively , and their corresponding LUMOs were estimated to be -3.34 , -3.63 and -3.83 eV using the optical band gaps ( in Table 1 ) measured from the onset of thin - film absorption. Moreover , PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT exhibited narrower band gaps ( ca. 1.46 eV ) than PPyDPP-BT ( ca. 1.54 eV ). The appropriate HOMO / LUMO levels of PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT combining the narrow band gaps may enable these polymers to behave as promising ambipolar semiconductors for high - performance optoelectronic devices. Moreover , the LUMO of PBTTDPP-2FBT is extremely close to that of PC71BM which is not ideal for charge transfer. Detailed physicochemical characteristics and molecular weights for PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT are summarized in Table 1. respectively. The significant difference in charge carrier mobilities for PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT is strongly related to their diverse effect of molecular structures , leading to the distinct molecular crystallinity and film morphology. Their distinct characteristics are also reflected by their OSC performance as follows . The LUMO / HOMO levels of PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT verify that these polymers are promising ambipolar copolymers with relatively high electron and hole 2 and 3 , respectively. The inappropriate match of LUMO with PC71BM could be a contributing factor for the reduction in J sc for PBTTDPP-2FBT - based PSCs , similar to those of PPyDPP-TT - based PSCs. 24 This phenomenon suggest that the very narrow band gap materials ( ca. 1.30 - 1.45 eV ) can not act as donor successfully with fullerene derivatives if their energy levels can not be matched effectively . Grazing incidence wide - angle X-ray scattering ( GIWAXS ) was performed on the blended polymer films to investigate the molecular stackings and orientations of the active layers of PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT in the devices ( Figure 5 ). The polymers were compared using Gaussian fit model as a guideline for a broad comparative analysis. The full width at half maximums ( FWHMs ) of the ( 100 ) diffraction Further studies should be performed to achieve better phase separation. Ensuring a more ideal match between the donor and acceptor would increase the PCEs of polymer / fullerene PSCs and all - polymer solar cells .",

    "sentence": "27 On the other hand , despite using additives or post-treatment methods , the PCE of QA - based polymers is still limited to 2-3 % . 24,27 Therefore , rational design of polymer backbone for QA - based polymers is urgently needed for further advancement in optoelectronic performance. On the basis of above consideration , we firstly introduce vinylene linkage into QA - containing polymer , namely PQTE. In view of its rigid and transconfiguration , thienylene-vinylenethienylene in polymer PQTE is expected to result in much planar configuration and strong interchain interaction. 28,29 For comparison , polymer PQ2T containing QA and bithiophene was also synthesized. As a result , the introduction of vinylene linkage improves not only the crystallinity of thin films but also the miscibility with PC71BM. In OTFTs , PQTE film exhibited a short π-π stacking distance of 3.49 Å and high mobility up to 0.67 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . In solar cell , as donor material , PQTE exhibited PCE up to 3.9% because of the better miscibility with PC71BM than that of PQ2T though PQTE showed stronger intermolecular interaction. It is noteworthy that the PCE of PQTE is among the highest performance for QA - based polymers even though these devices were fabricated without any additives or post-treatments . The absorption spectra of two polymers both in dilute chloroform solution and in solid state are show in Fig. 1 and relevant data are summarized in Table 1. Compared with PQ2T , acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s^-1 . PQTE showed red - shift absorption both in solution and thin film owing to extended π-conjugation induced by integration of vinylene linkage. For PQ2T , the maximum absorption peak was featureless and no obvious spectral shift was observed in solid state compared with that in dilute solution , indicating the polymer might form pre-aggregates in solution. 31 In the case of polymer PQTE , the maximum absorption profile was significantly sharper and there was a prominent shoulder peak at longer wavelength ( ~ 499 nm ). Moreover , the shoulder peak became much finer and stronger in thin film , which demonstrates that vinylene linkage in PQTE lead to much strongly aggregate in solid state. However , a slightly bathochromic shift ( ~ 10 nm ) was observed going from solution to thin film for PQTE which was also observed in other polymers. 32 Density - functional theory ( DFT , B3LYP / 6-31G ) was performed to model the electron density distributions of two trimers , as shown in Fig. S4. From their highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) , we can observe that QA unit exhibited weak electro-deficient character and HOMO is not delocalized over the whole backbone. 19 This is consistent with the fact that the weak shoulder peaks at around 550-630 nm can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ).",

The HOMO levels of PQTE and PQ2T calculated from the To probe how the incorporation of vinylene linkage affects the charge transport of PQTE , bottom-gate / top - contact transistors were fabricated with channel length of 30 µm and channel width of 500 µm. The insulator was 300 nm SiO 2 layer passivated with octyltrichlorosilane ( OTS ). Polymer solution was heated and stirred at 80 °C for 5 hours before spin - coated on the substrate. The film thickness was about 35-40 nm. All films were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. Au was used as source and drain electrodes by vacuum deposition. Fig. 2 shows the typical output and transfer curves of FETs based on two polymers. Carrier transport performances are summarized in Table 2. PQTE based FETs exhibit a maximum hole mobility as high as 0.67 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with the average value of 0.54 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and high on / off ratio ( I on / I off ) of 10^-6 -10^-7 . This value is the highest mobility reported so far for quinacridone - based polymers. For PQ2T - based FETs , the highest mobility is calculated to be 0.30 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with the average value of 0.28 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and I on / I off of 10^-6 -10^-7 , which is slightly higher than reported value by Kazuo Takimiya group. We attribute this enhancement to the lower PDI of PQ2T in our work. Smaller threshold voltages ( V T ) are also observed for PQTE devices ( -9.8 V ) than those of PQ2T devices ( -12.0 V ). The high mobility and low V T of TFTs based on PQTE are perhaps due to the preferable orientation of PQTE film . To shed light on the structural effect by introduction of vinylene linkage into PQTE , geometry optimization and molecular ordering were determined by DFT and twodimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction ( 2D-GIXRD ) , respectively. The dihedral angle in PQTE trimers is slightly smaller than that of PQ2T trimmers suggesting better coplanar structure in PQTE ( Fig. S4 ). Comparing the XRD pattern of two polymer films , as shown in Fig. 3 , both polymer PQTE and PQ2T show ( h00 ) diffractions up to the fourth order indicating these polymers are long-range-ordered. However , large arcing diffraction of PQ2T suggested that there is no preferential orientation in the film which is consistent with the reference 19. In contrast , the film of PQTE shows much centralized points along q z axis and distinctly observable ( 010 ) diffraction along q xy axis. The results indicate that the film of PQTE formed preferentially ordered edge-on orientation on the substrate.",

Moreover , the presence of ( h00 ) peaks corresponding to lamellar structure further confirms that both face-on and edgeon orientations exists in this polymer film. Tapping - mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) further demonstrated the difference of morphology between two polymers ( Fig. S5 ). PQTE film exhibit uniform intertwined fibre structures with obviously crystalline zones , which is the result of strong intermolecular interaction. In contrast , PQ2T film shows nodule - like morphology with relatively loose packed grains. According to the result mentioned above , it is confirmed that the insert of vinylene linkage shortens the π-π stacking distance of adjacent polymer chains because of good planarity and extended π-conjugation of vinylene linkage. Strong interchain interaction improves the crystallinity of PQTE film. These observations are in good agreement with the mobility analysis . Bulk heterojuction solar cells were fabricated by employing PQTE or PQ2T as an electron donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor. The typical device configuration is ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al. J-V curves of the optimized photovoltaic devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra are displayed in Fig. 4b.

The thickness of active layer is about 100-115 nm. Note that no processing additives were used at the time of spin coating. Even without any post-treatment , the highest PCE for PQTE was 3.90% with a J sc of 9.74 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.73 V and a modest FF of 55% .

It is noteworthy that PCE of 3.90% is among the highest efficiency reported for quinacridone - based polymers via simple device architecture without any additives or post-treatments , which are unique properties of PQTE. In Fig. 4b , high photo - to - current responses were obtained in the range from 350 to 600 nm for two polymer / PC71BM blend films. For PQTE - based devices , the higher response verified higher J sc value which supports the results from J-V characteristics . The morphology of active layers was examined by bright field transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and AFM , respectively. In Fig. 5a , well distributed nano-fibrillar structures are observed in PQTE / PC71BM blend film. This interpenetrating network is beneficial for charge dissociation.",

    "sentence": "35 For PQ2T - based device , macrophase separation limits the probability of exciton dissociation leading to poor J sc ( Fig. 5b ). Additively , the results of AFM images ( Fig. S6 ) reveal that the grains in PQTE / PC71BM blend film are fairly homogeneous in size and shape. However , the PQ2T / PC71BM blend film shows large aggregates and the size is about 200-300 nm , indicating the poor dispersion of PC71BM in the polymer matrix. We note that pure film of PQTE shows a higher degree of crystallinity and order than film of PQ2T. What 's more , the polymer chains are closer than those of PQ2T. However , PQTE unexpectedly exhibits better miscibility with PC71BM while PQ2T / PC71BM blend film is apt to aggregate into large domains. This result could be explained by using DFT calculation and the experimental data collected from 2D-GIXRD of blend films. In blend films , thiophene-vinylene-thiophene ( TVT ) or bithiothene ( BT ) as donor unit in polymers backbone would interact with electro-deficient PC71BM via electrostatic interaction. In consideration of the length of donor units ( Fig. 5c ) , TVT unit with a length of 9.0 Å is larger than the size of PC71BM ( 7.2 ~ 8.0 Å ) , 36 which provides enough volume to accommodate the fullerene molecules. In contrast , short BT unit ( 6.5 Å ) would expel the fullerene resulting in selfaggregation of polymer chains and large domains of PC71BM. 37 This is further confirmed by the results of 2D-GIXRD. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S3 , in PQTE / PC71BM blend film , the lamellar distance shows 2.5 Å larger than that of in the polymer - only film. The significant increase indicates that PC71BM molecules probably intercalate on the crystal lattice of PQTE because of sufficient volume. 38 In contrast , the lamellar distance of PQ2T / PC71BM blend film exhibits negligible increases of 0.2 Å compared with the polymer - only film suggesting that PC71BM molecules can not intercalate well on PQ2T. As a result , good intercalation of PC71BM into the lamellar structure of PQTE is responsible for this high PCE . We synthesized a novel quinacridone - based polymer , PQTE , containing thiophene-vinylene-thiophene unit. PQ2T without vinylene linkage was also synthesized for comparison. As a result , the incorporation of vinylene linkage can efficiently shorten π-π stacking distance and improve the crystallinity of thin film. In TFTs , strong intermolecular interaction of PQTE enhances the charge carrier mobility up to 0.67 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . In solar cell , high PCE of 3.9% was obtained by using PQTE as donor and PC71BM as acceptor while PQ2T - based devices showed moderate PCE of 2.70% . It is noteworthy that high PCE were obtained without any additives or post-treatments. Better miscibility was observed in PQTE / PC71BM blend film compared with that of PQ2T / PC71BM blend film although strong interchain interaction existed in polymer PQTE.",

It is recognized that the absorption of PCDT - ADA centered at about 700 nm is slightly hypsochromic shifted along with the obviously broadened absorbance in the lowenergy band relative to that of in dilute o-DCB solution , which may be attributed to the increased interactions of the various segments. We note that the absorption profile of PCDT - ADA , with repeating unit of CDT-BT-DTS-BT , is essentially bathochromic shifted comparing to the peak absorption located at about 672 nm for DTS-BT based alternating copolymer. 28 Analogous trend can also be realized for copolymers based on BDT derivatives as D1 unit. It is also worth pointing out that PCDT - ADA exhibits slightly redshifted absorbance relative to the copolymers based on BDT derivatives , which can be attributed to the stronger electrondonating properties of CDT than the BDT unit and the tendency of forming -stacking as thin films. This observation agrees with other reported D-A type of conjugated polymer systems that are based on CDT / BDT derivatives as the electron - donating units and BT as the electron - accepting unit. 22,28,29 The optical band gaps ( Eg opt ) of the resulting ternary copolymers as estimated from the onset of the absorbance of thin films are in the range of 1.49^1.61 eV .

The device based on PCDT - ADA showed a moderate performance with a moderate PCE = 2.80% ( VOC = 0.64 V , JSC = 11.2 mA cm^-2 and FF = 0.39 ) , which may 80 correlate to the unanticipated geminate recombination due to the straight octyl side chain in DTS unit. 36 The replacement of the CDT unit by a weaker electron - donating group of BDT-T moiety provides a nearly unchanged PCE = 2.79% ( VOC = 0.77 V , JSC = 8.78 mA cm^-2 and FF = 0.39 ) for copolymer PBDT-T-ADA. We measurements , the higher JSC of PBDT-O-ADA is likely correlated to the variation in lm morphology. 26,37 The accuracy of the measured JSC values was confirmed by the calculated integration of the EQE with the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum ( Fig. 6b ). It is worth noting that copolymer PCDT - ADA exhibits prolonged response beyond 800 nm , which agrees with the observation of extended absorbance as thin films. Additionally , the PBDT-O-ADA exhibited much higher values in the range of 380-730 nm than copolymer PBDT-T-ADA , which is in good consistence with the higher short circuit current of the former .

Compared to PDTS - BTA , adding thiophene bridges in PDTS - DTBTA improves planarity and increases effective conjugation of the polymer main chain , which translated into broader and stronger absorption , higher hole mobility , and better photovoltaic performance. Under the illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2 , the PSC based on PDTS - DTBTA / PC 70 BM demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 3.80% , which is significantly improved in comparison with that ( 1.64% ) of the device based on PDTS - BTA / PC 70 BM under the same experimental conditions. copolymers containing DTS donor unit and BTA acceptor unit , PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA ( see Scheme 1 ).

The effect of thiophene bridges on absorption , morphology , mobility , and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers was fully investigated in this paper. ' Synthesis and Thermal Stability. Synthetic routes of the polymers are outlined in Scheme 1. The two copolymers PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction. 42 All the two polymers have good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , toluene , and chlorobenzene. Molecular weights and polydispersity indices ( PDIs ) of the polymers , as shown in Table 1 , are determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration. Molecular weight of the polymers was determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ). The M n 's of PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA were found to be 6.7 x 10^3 and 8.0 x 10^3 g / mol , respectively , with the corresponding polydispersity indices of 2.07 and 1.80. Thermal stability of the polymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 2 shows the absorption spectra of PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA in chloroform solution and in solid film. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. The solution absorption spectra of PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA show similar profile with the absorption maxima at 567 and 575 nm , respectively. The spectral red shift for PDTS - DTBTA solution could be attributed to its planar backbone , benefiting from reduced steric hindrance by insertion of the thiophene bridges. The advantage of adding the thiophene bridges is also revealed by molar extinction coefficient , as shown in Figure 2b. The absorbance per unit thickness of PDTS - DTBTA film at maximum absorption reached 0.6 x 10^-2 / nm , much higher than that ( 0.5 x 10^-2 / nm ) of PDTS - BTA film. Compared to PDTS - BTA , the broader and stronger absorption feature for PDTS - DTBTA is beneficial to its photoharvesting when it is used as donor material in PSCs. The absorption spectra of the polymer films , as also shown in Figure 2b , red - shifted than that of the polymer solutions , which is a common phenomenon due to the polymer main chain aggregation and interactions in the solid film. 43 In addition , there are stronger shoulder peaks in the long wavelength direction of the polymer film absorption spectra , indicating that there exist some ordered structure in the polymer films , which should benefit higher hole mobility and photovoltaic performance of the polymers. 44 The absorption edges of PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA films are at 684 and 696 nm , corresponding to bandgap of 1.81 and 1.78 eV , respectively. Furthermore , the absorption spectra of PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA films are red - shifted obviously in comparison with that of the D-A copolymers of BTA copolymerized with other weak donor units such as fluorene , 38 carbazole , 37 and BDT. 39,40 The results suggest that enhancing the electron - donating ability of the donor unit to enhance the orbital mixing with the acceptor unit in the D-A copolymers is an effective way for narrowing the bandgap and broadening the absorption of the copolymers. Hole Mobility. Hole mobility of the two copolymers was measured by the space charge limit current ( SCLC ) method , as shown in Figure 3. PDTS - DTBTA with thiophene bridges demonstrated a hole mobility of 1.24 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which is 3 orders higher than that ( 3.06 x 10^-7 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) of PDTS - BTA.

Figure 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the two copolymers. The onset reduction potential ( j red ) and onset oxidation potential ( j ox ) of PDTS - BTA are -1.95 and 0.38 V vs Ag / Ag + , respectively , corresponding to LUMO and HOMO energy levels of -2.76 and -5.09 eV , respectively. After introducing the thiophene bridges in PDTS - DTBTA , its LUMO energy level is decreased to -2.81 and its HOMO energy level is slightly upshifted to -5.05 eV , thus leading to a reduced electrochemical bandgap ( E g ec ) of PDTS - DTBTA. In addition , the E g ec values are ca. 0.5 eV larger than the E g opt values , which is probably due to the exciton binding energy of conjugated polymers. 46 The smaller energy difference ( 0.46 eV ) between E g ec and E g opt for PDTS - DTBTA than that ( 0.52 eV ) for PDTS - BTA indicates that PDTS - DTBTA may have smaller exciton binding energy. The onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials and LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the polymers measured are also listed in Table 2 for clear comparison. Theoretical Calculation. To provide further insight into the fundamentals of molecular architecture , molecular simulation was carried out with a chain length of n = 1 at the DFT B3LYP / 6-31G(d) level with the Gaussian 03 program package. 47 To simplify the calculation , only one repeating unit of each polymer was subject to the calculation , with alkyl chains replaced by CH 3 groups. The simulated electron density distributions and the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels along with optimized geometry are shown in Figure 5. When benzotriazole was incorporated into the D-A polymers , one must aware the possible steric hindrance brought by the peripheral H atoms and the incorporated solubilizing alkyl chains , which is more significant than in benzothiadiazole. As shown by the optimized geometry ( Figure 5b ) , the insertion of thiophene bridge can well relieve the steric hindrance between the BTA acceptor unit and DTS donor unit and provide improved planarity and greater conjugation length. Recently studies showed that planarity can provide better HOMO / LUMO orbital overlap , thus enhancing the absorption coefficient , 46 which is consistent with our observed higher molar extinction coefficient in PDTS - DTBTA.",

Figure 6 shows the J-V curves of the PSCs under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 3. The V oc for the optimized PSC based on PDTS - BTA : PC 70 BM blend was 0.71 V , which is 0.08 V higher than that ( 0.63 V ) of the optimized PSC based on PDTS - DTBTA , benefiting from its lower lying HOMO energy level. The larger V oc difference ( 0.08 V ) than that ( 0.04 eV ) of their HOMO levels difference is due probably to the influence of other factors on the V oc , such as morphology and carrier recombination rate , etc. Also , it worth noting that J sc is strongly affected by the concentration of PC 70 BM in the blend. A higher concentration of PC 70 BM should favor the formation of the interpenetrated networks of the fullerene acceptor , which in turn favors the effective charge separation and charge transportation. Increasing of the PC 70 BM concentration over the weight ratio of 1 : 1 resulted in decrease of the J sc and PCE values of the PSCs , probably due to the reduction of the amount of polymer donor , which results in the reduction of absorption and hole transporting ability of the active layer. Thus , in both cases , a 1 : 1 weight ratio seems to be the optimal ratio to form the interpenetrated networks for effective charge separation and transportation. At the optimal donor / acceptor weight ratio , the PSC based on PDTS - BTA demonstrates a J sc of 5.65 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.71 V , a FF of 0.408 , and PCE of 1.64% . The PSC based on PDTS - DTBTA shows a better photovoltaic performance with J sc of 9.52 mA cm^-2 , V oc of 0.63 V , FF of 0.63 , and PCE of 3.80% . In comparison with PDTS - BTA , the larger molar extinction coefficients of PDTS - DTBTA and higher hole mobility along with slightly better overlap of absorption spectrum with the solar spectrum can account in part for the increase in J sc , as revealed by incident photon to current efficiency ( IPCE ) spectra.",

When 1,8-diiodooctane was used as a solvent additive to optimize the mixing morphology , the maximum power conversion efficiency reached by a polymer solar cell based on PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM was 5.18% , which was slightly higher than that of the benzothiadiazole (BT)-based analogue ( 5.01% ). These results demonstrated the promising effectiveness of benzoselenadiazole as an electron - deficient unit for the design of the donor - acceptor photovoltaic polymers . For the past two decades , solution - processed semiconducting polymers , as important functional materials , have been applied to low - cost printed electronic devices such as polymer lightemitting diodes ( PLEDs ) , field - effect transistors ( FETs ) , sensors , photodetectors , and polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). 1 The polymers can be molecularly engineered to possess suitable optical and electronic properties through synthesis and assembly in the films for the requirements in each type of device. For PSCs application , 2 further improvement on the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) is expected to follow from the development of novel conjugated polymers with higher carrier mobility and broader absorption of the solar spectrum , especially in the red and near - infrared regions. 3 It has been well demonstrated that the utilization of electron - donating ( D ) and electron - accepting ( A ) building blocks in the polymer backbone is one of the most promising and attractive strategies for designing organic semiconducting polymers. The absorption spectra and energy levels of D-A type polymers can be modulated by adjusting the contribution of intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ). 4 Because many kinds of electron - rich building blocks contain thiophene unit , a simple method to tune the properties of the polymers is replaced the sulfur ( S ) atom in thiophene with a selenium ( Se ) atom. Se atom is much larger in size and less electronegativity compared with the S atom , and thus Secontaining polymers are expected to be more effective in extending the absorption spectrum toward the infrared region. In addition , the Se - containing unit is more polarizable than the S analogue ; thus , the interchain Se°°°Se interactions could improve charge mobility of the polymers. The red - shifted absorption spectrum and higher charge carrier mobility should contribute to higher photovoltaic performance. In fact , some Se - containing electron - rich building blocks , such selenophene , 5 benzodiselenophene , 6 and selenolo[3,2-b]thiophene , 7 have been used in the design of semiconductor polymers and show higher FET mobility and promising photovoltaic performance. On the other hand , for electron - deficient building blocks , the effect of the substitution of S with Se has been investigated less extensively.",

The higher - lying HOMO of PBDT - DTBSe compared with that of PBDT - DTBT resulted in decreasing the V OC of PSC , since V OC of the devices shows a primary correlation with the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the fullerene acceptor. Crystalline Structures and Hole Mobility. X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) measurements were carried out to understand the crystalline structures and molecular orientations of the polymers in solid state. Thin films were spin - coated on Si / SiO 2 substrates from a CB solution. As shown in Figure 3a , in the out - of - plane measurement , the XRD pattern of PBDT - DTBSe revealed a large diffraction peak at 4.3 ° , with a small peak at 8.5 ° , which can be assigned to the ( 100 ) and ( 200 ) diffractions of a layered structure. However , the in-plane measurement revealed only ( 010 ) diffraction due to intermolecular π-π stacking. The interlayer and interchain stacking distances of PBDT - DTBSe were calculated as 2.05 and 0.372 nm , respectively , while PBDT - DTBT showed an XRD pattern similar to that of PBDT - DTBSe , but with a shorter interchain stacking distance of 0.363 nm. The above results indicate a high degree of crystallinity for PBDT - DTBSe and PBDT - DTBT in the film , with the bulky side chains oriented vertically with respect to the substrate , while intermolecular π-π stacking is parallel to the substrate , as schematically shown in Figure 3b ( edge-on orientation ). Replacing a S atom with a Se atom seems to have minimal impact on the molecular orientations of the polymers , only slightly increasing the intermolecular π-π stacking distance. The high degree of crystallinity of PBDT - DTBSe and PBDT - DTBT in the films suggests a high hole mobility , which is an important requirement for effective photovoltaic polymers. The mobility was measured by using field - effect transistors ( FETs ) with a bottom-gate , top - contact device configuration built on n - doped silicon wafers. Figure 4 shows the typical transfer curves of both polymers.",

    "sentence": "PBDT - DTBSe shows a hole mobility of 5.4 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratio of 5 × 10^3 , while PBDT - DTBT gives a lower hole mobility of 2.6 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and on / off ratio of 1 × 10^3 . The threshold voltages for both polymers are -12 and -22 V , respectively. This increase of hole mobility by replaced S atom with Se atom was also found in other D-A type polymers. 5-7 Although the FET mobility might not be directly correlated to the photovoltaic performance since the situation of the charge transport is quite different from each other , the 2 times higher hole mobility of PBDT - DTBSe than that of PBDT - DTBT could suggest more effective charge transport to the electrodes in the bulk - heterojunction solar cells. Photovoltaic Properties. The photovoltaic properties of PBDT - DTBSe and PBDT - DTBT were investigated in BHJ solar cells with [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) as the acceptor. PSCs were fabricated with a typical sandwich structure of glass / ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / Ca / Al. The ratio of the polymer to PC 70 BM was optimized as 2 : 1 , 1 : 1 , and 1 : 2 , and the devices with a ratio of 1 : 1 showed the highest performance. Figure 5 shows the J-V curves of the devices with the highest photovoltaic performance under AM1.5 illumination ( 100 mW cm^-2 ). The corresponding V OC , short - circuit current ( J SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and PCE of the devices are also summarized in Table 1. For the PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM system , using pristine CB as a processing solvent , only moderate PCE of 3.23% was achieved , mainly due to the moderate J SC of 8.84 mA cm^-2 . Since J SC generally depends on the mixing morphology of the films , the film surface morphology was observed by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). As shown in Figure 6 , large domains can be seen in the blend film processed from pristine CB , which indicates that the nonoptimal nanoscale structure and the large phase separation lowers the charge separation and transport. It has been shown in many studies that a small amount of 1,8diiodooctane ( DIO ) can drastically enhance the interpenetrat - ing nanoscale morphology , thus improving the PCE of PSCs for polymer / fullerene systems.",

The observed DIO effects on morphology are attributed to the selective solubility of DIO to fullerene. As a result , with the introduction of DIO , 3 vol % , in CB , the V OC decreased slightly , but J SC and FF improved substantially , resulting in a higher PCE of 5.18% . It is noteworthy that both the PCE and J SC ( 13.58 mA cm^-2 ) of the PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM system are the highest for any BSe - containing polymer reported thus far. For PSCs based on PBDT - DTBT / PC 70 BM , a PCE of 5.01% was achieved simply by using pure DCB as a processing solvent , and AFM images revealed that a smooth film has been achieved ( Figure 6 ). As expected , using DIO as an additive did not entail any further improvement in performance for PBDT - DTBT / PC 70 BM systems. Figure 7 shows plots of the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the photovoltaic devices under monochromatic light illumination. For PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM , the shapes of the EQE curves of the devices spin - coated from pure CB and CB / DIO blend ( 97 / 3 v / v ) solutions are similar , but the latter exhibits higher values. The highest EQE values of the two plots are 0.47 and 0.68 , respectively. For PBDT - DTBT / PC 70 BM , the maximum response of EQE is similar to that of PBDT- DTBSe ( 0.65 at 400 nm ) , but the response extends only to 720 nm , which is shorter than that of the PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM system by ca. 80 nm. This should be the cause of the lower J SC under irradiation with simulated solar light. The J SC calculated from the integral of EQE curves and AM 1.5 spectrum are 13.28 and 10.90 mA cm^-2 for PBDT - DTBSe and PBDT- DTBT , respectively , which are consistent with the experimental J SC values under the simulated solar light ( match within 2% ) . We synthesized a novel BSe - based copolymer with a low band gap. The slightly higher photovoltaic performance of PBDT- DTBSe / PC 70 BM compared with PBDT - DTBT / PC 70 BM suggests that BSe is a promising building block for constructing photovoltaic polymers. Furthermore , both the PCE ( 5.18% ) and J SC ( 13.58 mA cm^-2 ) of the PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM system are the highest for any BSe - containing polymer reported thus far.",

In recent years , bulk - heterojunction polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have received considerable attention because of their advantages of low cost , light weight , easy fabrication and compatibility with flexible substrates. 1 The photoactive layer of the PSCs is composed of the blend of a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene derivative ( such as [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 60 BM ) ) acceptor. To increase the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs , the key issue is to design and synthesize high efficiency donor and acceptor materials with broad visible absorption , high charge carrier mobility , and suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels. 2,3 For conjugated polymer donor materials , broad and strong absorption and high hole mobility are very important. Poly ( thienylene vinylene ) derivatives ( PTVs ) possess a broad absorption covering the whole visible region and higher hole mobility , 4 which is attractive for the application as donor materials in PSCs. However , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSCs based on PTVs with alkyl chain as donor is only ca. 0.2 x 0.3% , 5 which is probably due to nonluminescent nature of the polymers. 6 Recently , He et al. synthesized a PTV derivative with D-A structure , ( PTBTV ) ( see Scheme 1 ) , which showed broad absorption and weak photoluminescence ( PL ). The PSC based on PTBTV as the donor demonstrated a PCE of 0.51% , 7 which is obviously improvement in comparison with that of the common PTVs. More interestingly Huo et al. synthesized poly(3-carboxylated thienylenevinylene ) ( P3CTV ) with an electron - withdrawing carboxylate substituent , which possesses a lower HOMO energy level and weak PL. The PCE of the PSCs based on P3CTV as the donor reached 2.01% , which is one order increase compared to the PSCs based on the common PTVs. 8 These results indicate that the photovoltaic performance of the PTV derivatives could be greatly improved by appropriate molecular structure modification.",

    "sentence": "Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) are the most promising alternatives to inorganic - based solar cells because of their light weight , flexibility , and large - scale manufacturing with low cost roll - toroll process. 1,2 The introduction of the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) concept has led to intensive research worldwide and rapid development in the field of PSCs. 3,4 The BHJ is formed by blending an electron - rich polymer as a donor and an electrondeficient fullerene derivative as an acceptor. 3,4 Such BHJ not only provides abundant donor-acceptor interfaces for exciton dissociation but also forms an interpenetrating network for free charges transport to collecting electrodes. 3,4 Very recently , power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) higher than 7% has been achieved by several groups , 5-10 which is significant progress in the field. Until now , fullerene derivatives have been proved to be the best and most commonly used electron acceptors. 11,12 Therefore , great efforts have been focused on developing new polymers with narrow band gap and beneficial nanoscale morphology. 5-10,13-19 Opencircuit voltage ( V oc ) and short - circuit current ( J sc ) are two most important parameters determining PCEs of PSCs. V oc is proportional to the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level of a donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of an acceptor , and J sc depends mainly on the LUMO energy level difference between the donor and the acceptor. Empirically , the minimum energy difference of 0.3 eV is required for efficient exicton dissociation. 2,20 Thus , the ideal LUMO energy level of the polymer would be ∼ 3.9 eV , since PCBM possesses a LUMO of 4.2 eV. After years of intensive study , some design criteria for efficient donor materials can be summarized as follows : 21 ( 1 ) with relatively narrow band gap ( the optimal value is about 1.5 eV ) 22,23 to efficiently absorb sunlight for converting into J sc ; ( 2 ) with balanced HOMO and LUMO energy levels for a maximum V oc and minimum LUMO offset to avoid unnecessary energy loss ; ( 3 ) good solubility and appropriate miscibility with fullerene derivatives for solution processing and an optimal nanoscale morphology. On the basis of above rules , various low band gap polymers have been synthesized and utilized in PSCs. 5-10,13-19 9,9-Dialkylfluorene has been used as a building block for constructing donor-acceptor conjugated polymers in PSCs. In 2003 , a low band gap polyfluorene derivative ( PFDTBT ) was first reported as a donor in BHJ solar cells with a PCE of 2.2% . 24 Although PFDTBT - based PSCs demonstrated a considerable V oc of 1 V , the low photocurrent , which maybe result from the low carrier mobility of the polymer , limited the efficiency. Later , PFDTBT polymers carrying different flexible alkyl chains have been studied by several groups , and the PCE was improved to 4.5% .",

    "sentence": "25 Yang et al. found that the bulky side chains at the 9-position sp 3 -hybridized carbon in fluorene unit of PFDTBT hinders π-π stacking of polymer chains in solid film , which impedes carrier transport. 25 ABSTRACT : A novel donor-acceptor copolymer containing 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene unit in the main chain , poly[9-(1 0hexylheptylidene)-2,7-fluorene-alt-5 , 5-(4 0 ,7 0 -di-2-thienyl-5 0 ,6 0dialkoxy-2 0 ,1 0 ,3 0 -benzothiadiazole ) ] ( PAFDTBT ) , has been synthesized and evaluated in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells ( BHJ PSCs ). The polymer possesses a low band gap of 1.84 eV , a low - lying HOMO energy level ( 5.32 eV ) , and excellent solubility in common organic solvents. PSCs based on PAFD - TBT and (6,6)-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) demonstrate a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.2% with a high fill factor ( FF ) of 0.70 , which indicates that 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene can be a very useful building block for constructing narrow band gap conjugated polymers for high - efficiency BHJ PSCs. In order to have high mobility in solid films , the polymer chains are required to closely pack in solid state. On the other hand , lateral flexible side chains are necessary to guarantee the conjugated polymers with desired solubility and processability in common organic solvents. We must make a balance between close packing and good solubility in designing high - efficiency polymer photovoltaic materials. 9-Alkylidene-9H-fluorene has a sp 2 -hybridized carbon at the 9-position as shown in Scheme 1a. Compared with 9,9-dialkyl-substituted fluorene , the 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene unit is inclined to take on a planar conformation , 26 which facilitates the polymer backbones forming close packing in solid state to enhance charge carrier transportation. 26 Here , we demonstrated for the first time that 9-alkylidene-9Hfluorene can be a very useful building block for constructing main chain donor-acceptor alternating narrow band gap conjugated polymers for high - efficiency PSCs. Poly[9-(1 0 -hexylheptylidene)-2,7-fluorene-alt-5,5-(4 0 ,7 0 -di-2-thienyl-5 0 ,6 0 -dialkoxy-2 0 ,1 0 , 3^0 -benzothiadiazole ) ] ( PAFDTBT ) ( Scheme 1b ) has been synthesized and used as a donor in BHJ PSCs. The two hexyl chains on the 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene unit and the two octyloxy chains on the 2^0 ,1 0 ,3 0 -benzothiadiazole unit can provide PAFDTBT good solubility in common organic solvents and will not interfere with the polymer chain packing in solid state. Under simulated solar illumination of AM 1.5G ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) , PCE of 6.2% is achieved in the PSCs composed of PAFDTBT and (6,6)phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ). The devices illustrate a V oc of 0.89 V , a J sc of 9.9 mA / cm^2 , and a considerably high fill factor ( FF ) of 0.70. Such high FF at J sc = 9.9 mA / cm^2 indicates that PAFDTBT with good electric property is a promising donor material for solar cell application.",

The X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) pattern of the powdery sample of PAFDTBT exhibits two peaks as shown in Figure S1 ( see Supporting Information ) ; the first peak with small angel of 4.9 ° indicated the distance of 17.9 Å between polymer backbones separated by alkyl side chains , and the second peak at 21.4 ° showed the formation a π-π distance of 4.1 Å between the polymer backbones. Such a short distance indicates the planar conformation and the close stacking of the polymer backbones in the solid state. 32 Optical and Electrochemical Properties. The absorption spectra of PAFDTBT in chloroform solution and in a film at 20 °C are shown in Figure 1a. In chloroform solution , PAFDTBT displays two absorption bands centered at 380 and 522 nm. In comparison with solution absorption , the absorption peaks in the film are red - shifted to 392 and 571 nm , respectively , and became broader. The red shift that occurs in going from the solution to the film is attributed to the aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state. The onset of the optical absorption of the PAFDTBT film is at 671 nm , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.84 eV. The HOMO energy level is determined by cyclic voltammogram to be at -5.32 eV , and the LUMO energy level of PAFDTBT is calculated to be -3.48 eV according to the HOMO energy level and the optical band gap. Such high LUMO energy level is expected to provide an enough driving force for efficient exciton dissociation. 21 Meanwhile , the low - lying HOMO energy level of PAFDTBT can offer a high V oc when blended with a fullerene derivative as an acceptor. As PAFDTBT has low absorption around 450 nm , PC71BM was chosen as an electron acceptor for the BHJ solar cells to increase light absorption in visible region. 33 As can be observed in Figure 1a , the PAFDTBT / PC71BM BHJ film ( 1 : 3 by weight ) has broad absorption covering the UV-vis range. For the analogous 9,9-dialkyl-9H-fluorenebased polymer P1 , the absorption spectrum in solution shows the maximum absorption bands are 389 and 528 nm , which are almost similar as the absorption peaks of PAFDTBT in solution. However , there is a red shift of only 20 nm when it goes from the solution to the solid state as show in Figure 1b.",

In addition , almost all devices present comparable parameters with J sc above 10 mA / cm^2 as shown in Figure S2 ( see Supporting Information ). Furthermore , the device performance can be pronouncedly improved with the addition of a small amount ( 0.5 vol % ) of the processing additive DIO. In this condition , PCE of 6.2% was achieved in the champion solar cell with V oc = 0.89 V , J sc = 9.9 mA / cm^2 , and FF = 0.70. It is especially striking that FF was improved 37% with the addition of the additive DIO although V oc is the same as and J sc is almost even up with the PSCs without DIO according to the statistical data in Figure S2. Just as expected , PAFDTBT - based PSCs exhibited higher J sc , especially higher FF than P1 - based PSCs as shown in Figure 2b , 27 which showed PCE of 3.1% with V oc = 0.97 V , J sc = 6.7 mA / cm^2 , and FF = 0.47. The addition of the processing additive DIO can not enhance the photovoltaic performance of P1 - based solar cells. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.",

    "sentence": "Therefore , it can be concluded that 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene as a donor unit presents some advantages over 9,9-dialkyl-substituted 9H-fluorene units. First of all , the alkyl chains on 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene could decrease the steric hindrance compared with 9,9-dialkyl-substituted 9H-fluorene units and also form a planar structure to improve the intermolecular stacking of the polymers , resulting in the improved charge mobility. Further , the extended π-conjugation in the 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene unit will act as a stronger electron - rich donor , resulting in a lower band gap. Third , due to the better crystallinity of PAFDTBT , favorable morphology of the blend film for good photovoltaic performance can be achieved with the help of the additive. The external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) were measured under illumination of monochromatic light. As shown in Figure 3 , a significant photo - to - current response can be observed in nearly the entire visible range of 370-570 nm with EQE value of 50-60 % for both the PAFDTBTbased devices with and without DIO. This high EQE response and high FF of 0.70 also indicate balanced charge transport and improved active - layer morphology due to the addition of DIO. 34 Bottom-gate , top - contact organic field effect transistors ( OFETs ) were fabricated from PAFDTBT and the blend of PAFDTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) to investigate the charge transport property. The hole mobility of the pristine PAFDTBT film spin - cast from 1,2-DCB solution was 1.67 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10^5 . When PAFDTBT film was treated by solvent - assistant annealing at 120 °C for 15 min , 35 the hole mobility was further improved 1 order of magnitude to 1.0 x 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Moreover , the hole mobility of the film spin - cast from the blend of PAFDTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) in 1,2-DCB solution was also investigated , which is 1.40 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The output and transfer characteristic curves of the related OFETs are shown in Figure 4. Significantly , the hole mobility of the film spin - cast from the blend of PAFDTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) in 1,2-DCB solution was further improved for almost 3 times to 3.93 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with the addition of DIO ( 0.5 vol % ) without further device optimization as shown in Figure 5. The data are summarized in Table S1 ( see Supporting Information ). Hence , the large increase in FF with the addition of DIO was attributed , at least partially , to the increased hole mobility induced by DIO.",

    "sentence": "Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was used to investigate the surface morphology of the blend of PAFDTBT : PC71BM = 1 : 3 in 1,2-DCB with or without the additive DIO , since the morphology of the blend film can largely affect charge separation and transport. 36,37 As shown in Figure 6 , AFM images show the blend film of PAFDTBT : PC71BM = 1 : 3 in 1,2-DCB with or without the additive DIO both possess uniform and finer structures. However , without the additive the surface of the active layers of PAFDTBT : PC71BM is quite smooth , with a root-mean-square ( rms ) of 0.486 nm. Meanwhile , with the addition of DIO ( 0.5 vol % ) , the surface of the active layers become rough , with a rms of 0.735 nm , which suggested larger phase separation is more favorable for charge transport. 36 The increase of surface roughness and the occurring of the phase separation are responsible for the enhancement of FF with the addition of DIO. Without addition of DIO , despite high charge separation efficiency observed by efficient photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching for PAFDTBT ( see Figure S4 in Supporting Information ) , a small fraction of carriers might recombine at donor / acceptor interfaces before reaching the electrodes , since the charge transfer state ( CT ) emission occurred at 850 nm in PL spectra. 38 With addition of DIO , the phase separation of the active layers of PAFDTBT : PC71BM increases , and charge separation efficiency decrease a little as shown by incompleted PAFDTBT PL quenching , but the charge carrier mobility increased and recombination decreased , which resulted in improved FF. The appropriated domain sizes and phase separation can produce the best photovoltaic performance. 4 With the addition of a larger amount of DIO ( 1% and 2% ) , the blend morphology showed strikingly different. The roughness increased a lot and too big phase separation deteriorated photovoltaic performance ( Figure S3 and Table S2 in Supporting Information ). Only 0.5% DIO provided the best performance. This finding highlights that controlling the morphology of the donor / acceptor network is critical to optimize efficiency . A novel 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene containing main chain donor-acceptor type polymer ( PAFDTBT ) has been designed , synthesized , and applied in BHJ PSCs. PCE of 6.2% with V oc = 0.89 V , J sc = 9.9 mA / cm^2 , and FF = 0.70 was achieved in PSCs based on PAFDTBT : PC71BM , which indicates that PAFDTBT is a promising candidate for high - efficiency solar cells. To the best of our knowledge , PAFDTBT is the first 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene - containing low band gap conjugated polymers used for BHJ PSCs. Our research results suggest that 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene can be a very useful building block for the construction of narrow band gap conjugated polymers for high - efficiency BHJ polymer photovoltaic cells.

Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted increased attention due to their potential application toward flexible , large - area , and low - cost photovoltaic devices. 1 Since the introduction of the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) concept , significant efforts have been put forth to improve the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) to meet the criterion of high performance photovoltaic applications. 2 Very recently , efficiencies higher than 8% have been achieved by several groups , which shows great potential for commercialization. 3 To achieve highly efficient PSCs , conjugated polymers with relatively low band gaps , high absorption - coefficients , balanced HOMO and LUMO energy levels , good solubility , and appropriate miscibility with fullerene derivatives in blended active - layers are important prerequisites. Extensive π-conjugation of a rigid polymer backbone will facilitate intermolecular interactions between polymer chains and increase the charge mobility of the polymers. 4 Recently , several ladder - type copolymers have been investigated for achieving efficient PSCs. 5 Specifically , silole - containing semiconducting polymers have been known to exhibit altered properties with respect to their carbon analogues. A variety of functionalized silolecontaining semiconducting polymers have been reported to show promising characteristics as materials for PSCs. 6,7 The silole(silacyclopentadiene) moiety has been investigated as a system where the σ*-orbital of the silicon-carbon bond interacts with the π*-orbital of the butadiene fragment resulting in a lower lying LUMO. 7a The research groups of Yang and Brabec have independently shown that replacing the bridging carbon atom in cyclopenta [2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene containing polymers with silicon helps to increase the crystallinity of the polymers 7b,c providing polymers that have relatively high charge carrier mobilities. 7d Studies have also indicated that these silicon bridged polymers have good environmental stability. 7e In considering the above , we have designed and synthesized a new variety of low bandgap copolymers that contain a multifused thienyl-fluorene-thienyl subunit where the bridging carbon atom on the fluorine has been replaced with a silicon atom. Forced planarization by covalently fastening adjacent aromatic units within the polymer backbone helps to strengthen parallel π-orbital interactions to extend the effective conjugation length and facilitate π-electron delocalization , providing an effective way to reduce the band gap.",

    "sentence": "Moreover , coplanar geometries and rigid structures can suppress rotational disorder around interannular single bonds and lower the reorganization energy , which can in turn enhance intrinsic charge mobilities. 8 In order to further modulate and optimize the electronic and optical properties , exploration of different electron - deficient units incorporated into multifused thienyl-fluorene-thienyl based polymeric backbone is highly desirable. Benzothiadiazole ( BT ) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( PD ) units are widely used electron - deficient units introduced in the D-A copolymers due to their suitable electron affinity and easy synthesis. 9 In addition , diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) has also emerged as a useful acceptor unit because of its planar conjugated bicyclic structure and strong electron - withdrawing nature of polar amide group. 10 On the basis of the modified multifused thienyl-fluorene-thienyl as the core structure , we have successfully synthesized three D-A copolymers , PSiFDCTPD , PSiFDCTBT , and PSiFDCTDPP ( Scheme 1 ). The synthesis , characterization , and photovoltaic applications of these polymers will be discussed . . . As shown in Figure 1a , the absorption spectra of the three polymers in dilute chloroform exhibited two characteristic bands. Each polymer has an absorption band located between 300 and 550 nm with a second broad absorption from 500 to 800 nm. The shorter wavelength absorption can be attributed to the π-π* transition of the heptacylic units , while the lower energy band can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the electron - rich and electron - deficient segments. 11 Compared to PSiFDCTPD , which shows absorption maxima at 535 and 562 nm in solution , PSiFDCTBT exhibited an absorption maximum at 410 nm with a bathochromic shift of the ICT band to 646 nm. PSiFDCTDPP exhibited an absorption maximum at 430 nm with the ICT band at 714 nm. From Figure 1b , the absorption of all the polymers shifted toward longer wavelengths from solution to the solid state , indicating that the planar structure of SiFDCT is capable of inducing strong interchain interactions. The optical band - gaps ( E g opt ) deduced from the absorption edges of the thin film spectra are in the following order : PSiFDCTPD ( 1.88 eV ) > PSiFDCTBT ( 1.76 eV ) > PSiFDCTDPP ( 1.57 eV ). The difference of their absorption maxima as well as E g opt indicates that the acceptor strength is in the order DPP > BT > DP. 12 Note that the intensities of the shorter wavelength bands of the polymer in the solid state are apparently stronger than those in the solution state , which suggests that the rigid and coplanar nonacyclic units can enhance their light absorption ability in the solid state.

All three polymers show planar conformations through the entirety of the polymer backbone. The dihedral angles between the acceptor moieties and the neighboring SiFDCT fused - ring are ∼ φ = 0 ° . The frontier orbitals of the model compounds SiFDCTPD , SiFDCTBT , and SiFDCTDPP are shown in Figure 2. The calculated HOMO energy levels of SiFDCTPD , SiFDCTBT , and SiFDCTDPP were -5.54 , -5.72 , and -5.68 eV , respectively , which are in general agreement with the experimentally determined values for the corresponding polymers ( see cyclic voltammetry measurements below ) albeit with a shift of 0.2 - 0.4 eV. For the corresponding alternating dimers , the electron density of the LUMO was primarily located on the electron - accepting unit ( Figure 2d ) , whereas the electron density of the HOMO was more evenly distributed across both the donor and acceptor with the exception of PSiFDCTDPP ( Figure 2c ). This redistribution of electron density shows a pronounced intramolecular charge separation between the donor and acceptor following excitation. The electrochemically determined band gaps were deduced from the difference of the onset oxidation and reduction potentials. The energy levels are summarized in Figure 3. All of the polymers showed one stable and reversible pdoping and n - doping processes , which are important prerequisites for p - type semiconductor materials. The HOMO energy levels were estimated to be -5.31 eV for PSiFDCTPD , -5.32 eV for PSiFDCTBT , and -5.26 eV for PSiFDCTDPP , which are in an ideal range to ensure improved air stability and greater attainable V oc in the final device.

However , after blending with PC61BM , the hole mobilities of the blended films exhibited an improvement in performance several orders of magnitude higher than the pure films. This phenomenon has been reported by others 13 and is most likely due to the intercalation of PC61BM between the polymer side chains , which in turn inhibits coiling of the polymer chains.

Both polymers possess moderate hole - mobilities of around x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) using PIDTT-TzTz-PC71BM as the active layer showed good power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs as high as 5.53% and 5.90% ) in both conventional and inverted devices , without using any solvent additives. These results demonstrate that these broad bandgap PIDTT - TzTz polymers have potential to be used as a front cell for polymer tandem cells . Tremendous progress has been made in recent years on the development of organic photovoltaic materials , especially donor - acceptor ( D-A ) polymers , which have achieved an impressive photovoltaic performance of over 9% efficiency , when blended with fullerene derivatives. 1,2 Among semiconducting polymers , broad bandgap ( BBG ) materials have attracted a lot of attention because of their potential applications in tandem solar cells [3][4][5] and semi-transparent materials. [6][7][8][9] To date , regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) is one of the most representative BBG polymers. High photovoltaic performances of P3HT have been accomplished by utilizing indene-C 60 ( or C 70 ) bis-adducts as the electron acceptor in bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) devices. [10][11][12] However , the long - term oxidative stability of P3HT is an issue due to its high - lying HOMO level , as well as lm uniformity and reproducibility when it is used in large scale roll - to - roll printing because of P3HT 's sensitivity to the processing conditions. To solve these issues , other alternative materials have been developed. The approach of using a D-A polymer is an attractive way to develop conjugated polymers due to easy tuning of their bandgaps and energy levels. From a molecular design viewpoint , weak donors are usually adopted in the polymer structure to ensure a low - lying HOMO level , which is closely correlated with the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of polymer photovoltaic devices. 13 Many different kinds of donor structures have been utilized in BBG polymers , such as uorene , carbazole , benzodithiophene ( BDT ) , and indacenodithiophene ( IDT ). [14][15][16][17][18][19] Meanwhile , the incorporated acceptor moieties have included 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) , 4,4 0 -dihexyl-2,2 0 -bithiazole ( BTz ) , or 2,5-bis(thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo [5,4-d]thiazole ( TzTz ). 20,21 High power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) have been obtained through subtle choices of donor and acceptor segments and tuning the side - chain structures. 20,22 For example , PCDTBT , with a bandgap of 1.88 eV , prepared by copolymerizing 2,7-carbazole and DTBT , showed a high PCE above 6% . 14,15 Janssen and co-workers further incorporated this BBG polymer into tandem solar cells , which resulted in a higher PCE of greater than 7% for their best devices.",

    "sentence": "3 Nevertheless , compared to well - developed low bandgap polymers , BBG polymers remain less explored , especially while considering other aspects in addition to photovoltaic performance , such as longterm stability and ease of processing. It is highly desirable to design and synthesize new BBG materials to full these requirements. Ladder - type donors have been widely utilized in D-A polymers. [23][24][25][26][27][28][29] These large fused - ring moieties usually result in polymers with high charge carrier mobilities due to reduced reorganizational energies and good solubility in common organic solvents. Amorphous materials are usually obtained based on ladder - type donors possessing cyclopentadiene rings because the out - of - plane side - chains prevent ordered packing of polymer backbones. Therefore , the morphologies of the asprepared lms of polymers or fullerene blends are not sensitive to processing conditions according to our previous studies , 30,31 an important requirement for the commercialization of polymer solar cells. Moreover , impressive stability can be achieved based on ladder - type systems according to Cheng 's work. 32 The stable morphology of polymer lms contributed greatly to the overall stability of the device. Indacenodithieno [3,2-b]thiophene ( IDTT ) is a relatively new ladder - type donor , which features improved mobility and absorption coefficients of its polymers when compared to IDTbased polymers. 31 We believed that this donor would be an ideal segment for BBG polymers because it will not only enhance the mobility of the resulting polymers but also its weak donating strength should result in a deep - lying HOMO level , which is good for oxidative stability and critical to obtain a high V oc in photovoltaic devices. In this communication , two copolymers based on the IDTT donor were synthesized and investigated , namely PIDTT - TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT ( Scheme 1 ). TzTz was chosen as the acceptor moiety because of its rigid coplanar structure , which will not only facilitate p-electron delocalization but also enhance p-p stacking of the polymer backbone. TzTz - based polymers have also exhibited high mobilities in eld - effect transistors ( FET ) 33 and good photovoltaic performances. 16,19 In these two polymers , thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( TT ) were used as p-bridges , which was expected to increase the effective conjugation length and enhance intermolecular charge hopping between polymers. 34,35 However , PIDTT-TzTz-TT - based devices only showed a moderate PCE ( 4.4% ) , probably due to their poor solubility leading to un-optimized phase separation with PC71BM. Encouragingly , PIDTT - TzTz derived devices showed high PCEs of 5.53% and 5.90% , respectively in regular and inverted solar cell architectures , which makes it one of the best performing BBG polymers for PSCs. PIDTT - TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT were synthesized via the Stille cross-coupling polymerization reaction with palladium catalyst , the details of which can be found in the ESI. † PIDTT - TzTz has moderate solubility in hot chlorobenzene ( CB ) and dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) while PIDTT-TzTz-TT is only soluble in hot DCB.",

Differential scanning calorimetry of the polymers showed no apparent thermal transitions for either of the polymers between 20 °C and 280 C. The UV - vis absorption spectra of the two polymers in DCB solutions and in lms are shown in Fig. 1. For PIDTT - TzTz , an absorption peak at 569 nm was observed in the DCB solution while its maximum peak in the lm was blue - shied to 531 nm , probably due to twisting of the polymer backbone when the polymer chains were forced to pack together. Notably , PIDTT-TzTz-TT showed the same absorption maxima in both solution and lm states , which can be ascribed to the increased rigidity and coplanarity of its backbone compared to PIDTT - TzTz. 36 Both polymers possess a broad optical bandgap ( E g ) of 2.0 eV according to the onsets of lm spectra at around 620 nm. The energy levels of both polymers were estimated by cyclic voltammetry measurements. The corresponding redox curves are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI. † The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PIDTT - TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT are ( -5.24 , -3.21 ) and ( -5.34 , -3.03 ) eV , respectively. Owing to the incorporated IDTT donor moiety , both polymers possess reasonably low - lying HOMO levels , which is promising for achieving high V oc in their photovoltaic devices. 31 The even lower - lying HOMO level of PIDTT-TzTz-TT compared to that of PIDTT - TzTz is probably due to the higher aromaticity of the TT p - bridge unit relative to the thiophene unit. 37,38 The high - lying LUMO levels of both polymers guarantee sufficient energy offsets to drive charge separation at the interface between the polymer and PC71BM in photovoltaic devices. Charge mobilities of pristine polymers in FET devices were investigated with a bottom gate / top contact conguration. The corresponding transfer curves are shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI † and relevant parameters are summarized in Table 1. PIDTT-TzTz-TT showed a saturated hole mobility of 7.0 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , slightly higher than that of PIDTT - TzTz ( 1.5 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). This result suggests that the extended TT bridge in PIDTT-TzTz-TT indeed improves hole transportation , due to the increased coplanarity of the polymer backbone and enhanced intermolecular charge hopping compared to PIDTT - TzTz. 34 Photovoltaic properties of both polymers were investigated initially with a BHJ device conguration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / bis-C 60 / Ag under the illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mA cm^-2 ( Fig. S3 of the ESI † ).

Although PIDTT-TzTz-TT has a higher hole mobility than PIDTT - TzTz , the lower J sc and FF of PIDTT-TzTz-TT - based devices can be attributed to their inferior solubility , which reduces the polymer composition in the BHJ layer and leads to an un-optimized morphology. Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) images were acquired to investigate the difference of morphologies of BHJ layers ( Fig. S4 † ). A relatively smoother thin lm morphology was observed for the PIDTT - TzTz - based BHJ layer , coinciding with the better phase separation in this active layer , resulting in higher performance of devices. Since inverted polymer solar cells have the advantages of high air stability , preferred vertical composition gradient and compatibility with roll - to - roll printing techniques , they have been widely explored using various materials , including BBG polymers. [43][44][45] Therefore , PIDTT - TzTz was further explored using an inverted architecture ( Fig. S5 of the ESI † ). As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 2 , the inverted conguration led to a superior device performance compared to the conventional device architecture , possessing a V oc of 0.90 V , a J sc of 10.99 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 0.59 , giving a PCE of 5.90% .

All the J sc values calculated from the EQE curves under the standard AM 1.5G conditions match well with those obtained from the J-V measurements. Notably , the PIDTT - TzTz device has a high EQE of 70% around 550 nm , which ensures the efficient lightabsorbing ability of this BBG polymer. In conclusion , two BBG polymers PIDTT - TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT have been designed and synthesized based on the ladder - type donor , IDTT. Both polymers possess moderate holemobilities of around x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 .

The various electron - donating polymers had been strategically designed and developed to achieve high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ). They must possess several properties simultaneously such as good solubility , high mobility of charge carriers , appropriate energy levels of highest occupied molecular orbital ( E HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( E LUMO ) because these properties have relation with characteristic parameters of BHJ solar cells such as short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and fill factor ( FF ). 1-7 Among these parameters , J sc is mainly determined by the amount of absorbed light in an active layer of BHJ solar cell. Therefore , it has been recognized that development of narrow band gap polymers is one of the most effective way to increase PCE because they can capture solar photons extending to near - infrared. 8 Recently , donor - acceptor ( D-A ) approaches by incorporating an alternating electron donating ( D ) unit and an electron accepting ( A ) unit in the polymer backbone have been examined to narrow the band gap ( E g ) of the polymers. 9 Above all , benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) has attracted much attention as a D-building block of D-A type polymers.",

The former diffractions correspond to interchain distances between conjugated polymer backbones while the latter is attributed to π-stacking distance between planar polymer backbones as summarized in Figure 5. PBDTC - TT1 that has a hexyl chain at TT showed that the interchain distance observed by XRD is almost equivalent to length of the dodecyl ester chain at BDT estimated by the DFT calculation , whereas PBDTC - TT2 that has a dodecyl chain at TT showed the rather longer interchain distance in the XRD result. These results suggest that a hexyl chain at TT in PBDTC - TT1 is put in the interdigitated polymer main - chain packing separated by the dodecyl ester spacer but the dodecyl chain at TT in PBDTC - TT2 disturbs to form the dense packing , broadening the space adequately. Polymer Solar Cell. BHJ solar cells were fabricated by spin coating of o-dichlorobenzene solutions of PBDTC-TT The optimized BHJ OPV consisting of PBDTC - TT2 and PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 ) showed a PCE of 1.71% with J sc of 7.13 mA cm^-2 , FF of 0.47 , and V oc of 0.51 V as shown in Table 2 , which was lower than that of the optimized BHJ OPV with PBDTC - TT1 and PC 70 BM. The different length of the side chain at TT between PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 might affect miscibility of the components and the domain size of the BHJ layer. However , the surface image of the blend film of PBDTC - TT2 : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 ) observed by AFM was the aggregate of spherical domains similar to that of PBDTC - TT1 : PC 70 BM ( 2 : 3 ) ( Figure 3S in the Supporting Information ). The lower PCE of PBDTC - TT2 : PC 70 BM than PBDTC - TT1 : PC 70 BM is mainly attributed to the lower J sc . To investigate the difference of J sc s in the two BHJ OPVs , the hole mobility of the polymers was measured by the method of organic field effect transistors ( OFETs ). PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 showed hole mobilities of 6.9 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and 3.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively ( Figure 4S in the Supporting Information ). So , the lower J sc of the BHJ devices of PBDTC - TT2 could be due to the lower hole mobility compared to PBDTC - TT1. The extended interchain spacing of PBDTC - TT2 shown in Figure 5 could lead to the lower hole mobility.",

The difference of IPCE between both BHJ devices is responsible for the difference of their J sc . It is thought that narrowing of the interchain spacing of PBDTC-TT should be an effective factor to increase J sc as well as PCE from considerations of the results of XRD and OFET as mentioned above . In summary , thieno [3,4-b]thiophene ( TT ) and benzodithiophene dicarboxylate (BDTC)-based new donor - acceptor conjugated polymers were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization. They possess the narrow band gap of ∼ 1.5 eV , small π-stacking distance , high lying E HOMO and good solubility to common organic solvents. The BHJ solar cells using PBDTC - TT1 exhibited the PCE value of 3.03% with J sc of 12.54 mA cm^-2 , FF of 0.48 , and V oc of 0.51 V , while that using PBDTC - TT2 showed PCE of 1.71% with J sc of 7.13 mA cm^-2 , FF of 0.47 , and V oc of 0.51 V. The higher performance of PBDTC - TT1 : PC 70 BM ( 2 : 3 ) than PBDTC - TT2 : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 ) was almost ascribed to the higher J sc of the former device. According to XRD analysis and OFET measurements , the denser packing structure of PBDTC - TT1 results in the higher hole mobility , which leads to the higher PCE value in comparison with the device using PBDTC - TT2. BHJ OPVs based on PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 achieved efficient sensitization of the whole visible range and the near-IR region as far as 900 nm. These results show that the BDTC unit can behave as an electron - accepting unit of D-A type conjugated polymers , and also demonstrates that the series of PBDTC-TT is a candidate of new D-A type narrow band gap polymers for BHJ solar cells .",

    "sentence": "Recently , rod - coil copolymers containing P3HT segments have been designed for optoelectronic devices due to their tunable morphology. [24][25][26][27][28][29][30] McCullough et al. reported the synthesis of P3HT-coil based block copolymers with the hole mobility as high as 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . 26,27,29,39,40 Also , Thelakkat et al. applied the double - crystalline donor - acceptor block copolymer , P3HT-bpoly(perylene bisimide acrylate ) , to single - layer solar cells. 24,25 Another novel approach is to apply these rod - coil copolymers to a \" surfactant \" for solar cell device applications. [18][19][20][21][22] Fr echet et al. first employed a donor - acceptor diblock copolymer as a surfactant not only to tune the device morphology but also to stabilize the device structure against destructive thermal phase segregation. 18 In addition , the harmonizing effect of the diblock copolymer on a P3HT / perylene bisimide - based device has been explored for controlling the phase separation within the active layer. 19 Wudl and co-workers reported that the addition of 5 wt % P3HT - based copolymers resulted in an improved performance ( PCE = 3.5% ) , higher than that obtained from a pristine P3HT / PCBM device ( PCE = 2.6% ). 21 However , the synthetic methods for such block copolymers include complicated multistep reactions. In addition , there has never been a report on a photovoltaic application achieving more than 4% based on a surfactant approach employing block copolymers. Our group has developed a facile synthetic methodology for coil-rod-coil triblock copolymers with low polydispersities ( PDI < 1.2 ) by a combination of quasi-living Grignard metathesis and living anionic polymerizations , 31,32 as shown in Scheme 1. Our goal in this study is to incorporate different ratios of poly-(4-vinyltriphenylamine)-b-poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(4-vinyltriphenylamine) ( PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ) into P3HT / PCBM - based devices serving as a surfactant. The motivations for the selection of PTPA are as follows. ( 1 ) PTPA-P3HT-PTPA itself showed a clear microphase separation with a neat and periodic lamellar morphology of 10-12 nm in width , comparable to an exciton diffusion length. 32 ( 2 ) PTPA is an amorphous coil - like polymer , so PCBM may be selectively miscible with the PTPA domain rather than the crystalline P3HT domain. ( 3 ) The hole - transporting property of PTPA does not interfere significantly with the hole mobility of P3HT compared to completely insulating coil polymers like PS and PMMA segments. The effects of different block copolymer ratios on optical properties , morphology , thermal properties , and field effect transistor ( FET ) characteristics were studied and correlated to the solar cell performance. The experimental results suggested that the improved PCE of a P3HT / PCBM solar cell device achieving 4.4% and enhanced long - term stability upon heating could be attributed to the change of morphology and superior compatibilizing effect with the introduction of triblock copolymer , PTPA-P3HT-PTPA .

With the addition of the triblock copolymer , the blended films exhibit similar absorption spectra when compared to pristine P3HT / PCBM film. In general , the three distinct absorption peaks could be attributed to the π-π* transition ( 511 nm ) and π-π stacking ( 555 and 605 nm ) of P3HT. 33 Comparable absorption intensities of blend films containing 0% , 0.25% , and 1.5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , obtained at around 1.00 x 10^5 to 1.05 x 10^5 cm^-1 ( at an absorption maximum of 605 nm ) , indicate that small amounts of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , incorporated into the P3HT / PCBM system , do not affect significantly the crystallinity of P3HT. However , with the addition of 5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , the absorption coefficient apparently decreases , which not only decreases the absorptivity but also affects the packing of P3HT. 2a and summarized in Table 1. The PCE ( % ) of the corresponding polymer of various ratios of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA in P3HT / PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) system are 3.9 ( 0% ) , 3.9 ( 0.25% ) , 4.0 ( 0.5% ) , 4.2 ( 1% ) , 4.4 ( 1.5% ) , 4.2 ( 2.5% ) , 4.2 ( 5% ) , 3.6 ( 10% ) , and 3.0 ( 20% ) , respectively , as depicted in Figure 2 ( b ). Obviously , the enhanced PCE as compared to the pristine P3HT / PCBM system could be related to the addition of the surfactant. As listed in Table 1 , where the V oc values of the photovoltaic devices are maintained in the range of 0.61 - 0.63 V indicates that the small amounts of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA do not affect the HOMO level of the P3HT - based donor system. With similar absorption ability and molecular energy levels of the P3HT / PCBM / PTPA-P3HT-PTPA system described above , we could attribute the enhanced PCE to the charge transport mobility and morphology , as analyzing the following sections. Field Effect Transistors ( FETs ) Characteristics. Since the charge transport in polymer blends is crucial for solar cells , the FET is a powerful tool to investigate the hole and electron mobilities of polymer blends. 34 All FET devices were fabricated by employing top - contact configuration for reducing contact resistance. In order to understand the balance between hole and electron mobilities within polymer blends and its effect on solar cell performance , we used a bare Si / SiO 2 wafer without any surface treatment for preventing the vertical segregation of PCBM. 35 The transfer characteristics of the studied blended materials based FET devices are shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information.",

The μ h of the P3HT / PCBM system with various amounts of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA are 7.17 x 10^-4 ( 0% ) , 7.41 x 10^-4 ( 0.25% ) , 8.89 x 10^-4 ( 1.5% ) , and 1.50 x 10^-3 ( 5% ) cm2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , while their corresponding μ e are 2.58 x 10^-3 , 1.81 x 10^-3 , 1.52 x 10^-3 , and 1.95 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. The highest μ e / μ h ratio ( 3.6 ) of pristine P3HT / PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) is similar to a previous work with a space - charge - limited current ( SCLC ) model. 36 The higher electron mobility compared to the hole mobility is due to the intrinsic electrontransport and easily percolated network characteristics of PCBM. In our case , the hole mobility increases gradually which may be due to the donor characteristic of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , 32 further reducing the μ e / μ h ratio with the addition of the surfactant. Note that the low μ e / μ h ratio of 1.5% ( 1.7 ) and 5% ( 1.3 ) PTPA-P3HT-PTPA blended system could be achieved , and a balanced mobility is crucial for high - performance solar cell applications. Atom Force Microscopy ( AFM ) measurement was explored to further investigate the molecular organization and film morphology of the blended system. Figure 4 and Figure S3 ( in Supporting Information ) show the AFM images of the P3HT / PCBM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) system with different ratios of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA. The fiber - like structure could be observed with the addition ratios ranging from 0% to 1% . Interestingly , a sphere - like structure was found by adding 1.5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , as shown in Figure 4b. By further increasing the addition ratios from 2% to 5% , the morphology changes from sphere to fiber , which suggests that the formation of a smaller domain size of sphere - like conformations could enhance the interfacial area in comparison to the fibrous structure. Furthermore , with the balanced mobilities of charge transport ( μ e / μ h ∼ 1.7 ) , the highest J sc ( 11.2 mAcm-2 ) of the 1.5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA blended system could be reached in accordance with the above two factors.",

To further investigate the compatibilizing effect of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , the phase transition behavior of pristine materials ( P3HT , PCBM , and PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ) and blend systems ( P3HT / PCBM ( 3 mg / 3 mg ) and P3HT / PCBM / PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ( 3 mg / 3 mg / 6 mg ) ) , such as the glass transition temperature ( T g ) , melting temperature ( T m ) , and enthalpic changes upon melting , were estimated by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) under thermal pretreatment conditions ( 10 °C / min for both heating and cooling scans ) , as shown in Figure 7. The distinct melting peaks of PCBM and P3HT were 287.5 and 221.3 °C in lines c and d , respectively. Also , PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ( line e ) exhibited T g at 131.0 °C and T m at 198.5 °C , which correspond to the contribution of the PTPA and P3HT segments , respectively. For the P3HT / PCBM ( 3 mg / 3 mg ) binary blended system ( line b ) , the two melting peaks are assigned to the P3HT ( T m1 = 210.6 °C ) and PCBM ( T m2 = 284.3 °C ) melting characteristics in accordance with the corresponding pristine materials. With the addition of a surfactant to the ternary system ( P3HT / PCBM / PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , 3 mg / 3 mg / 6 mg ) , three distinct peaks ( T g = 128.1 °C , T m1 = 203.1 °C , and T m2 = 284.3 °C ) could be attributed to the PTPA segments of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , pristine P3HT combined with the P3HT segment of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , and pristine PCBM , respectively. The melting temperatures of the blend would decrease as compared to the individual components since the crystallinity and molecular arrangement were affected by each component. The broad endothermal melting peak of T m1 in the range of 158-240 ° C maybe due to the broad molecular weight distribution of pristine P3HT ( PDI ∼ 2 ) and the formation of different crystal sizes of P3HT segments in the blend system. The enthalpic change of the P3HT segments in the binary system is 4.36 J / g , similar to that of the ternary system ( 4.04 J / g ).",

Synthesis of the Random Copolymer P. In principle , two polymerization routes ( a and b in Scheme 1 ) can be followed to obtain the ternary random copolymer P via DHAP. Route a , carried out under the best conditions reported for DHAP of monomer 1 [ Hermann - Beller catalyst ( 4% mol ) , pivalic acid ( 30% mol ) , P(o-MeOPh) 3 ( 8% mol ) , Cs 2 CO 3 ( 2 equiv ) in dry toluene for 36 h ] , 23 failed to afford polymer P. This result can be likely ascribed to the low acidity of the hydrogen atoms at the 4,7-positions of the electron - accepting units 2 and 3 , which do not easily undergo C-H bond activation step. Actually , it is well known that the heterolytic dissociation energy represents a critical factor influencing the regioselectivity of the direct arylation processes. 24 For this reason , the C-H bond ortho-functionalization with electronwithdrawing groups ( e.g. , fluorine atoms ) is a common structural modification to increase the acidity of the hydrogen atoms , thus enhancing the reactivity of the C-H bonds involved in the activation process. 25 Polymerization was thus performed via the route b by reacting benzodithiophene 4 with dibromobenzothiadiazole 5 and dibromobenzotriazole 6 in 2 : 1 : 1 ratio ( Scheme 2 ). The process was investigated under various experimental conditions summarized in Table 1. Different polar solvents were tested at 120 °C in the presence of Pd(OAc) 2 ( 10% mol ) as the precatalyst , pivalic acid ( PivOH ) as the carboxylate ligand and potassium carbonate as the base under phosphine - free conditions ( Table 1 , entries 1- 5 ). The reaction in N,N-dimethylacetamide ( DMAc ) afforded a polymer ( M w = 64 kDa , M n = 9 kDa ) in 50% yield. In Nmethylpyrrolidinone ( NMP ) , also with microwave assistance , the precipitation of a dark solid consisting of oligomeric products was observed during the polymerization. Only oligomers were also obtained in a mixture of NMP and toluene ( volumetric ratio 1 : 1 ) and in N-benzylpyrrolidinone ( NBP ) ( used to increase the solubility of the products ) ( entries 2 and 4 ) , respectively. Considering the positive outcomes of DHAP in DMAc , we further investigated the effects of other experimental conditions both on yields and molecular weights of the reaction carried out in this solvent. Polymers with higher molecular weight were obtained in the presence of Pd(OAc) 2^5 % mol ( entries 6 and 7 ). Lowering the catalyst amount to 1% mol ( entry 8 ) significantly reduced both the molecular weight and the yield of the final polymer.",

    "sentence": "To determine the regiochemistry of the cross-coupling reaction , 2D NOESY spectra of F3-F5 were acquired. Because of stereoelectronic factors , the α-arylation of the benzodithiophene ring by C-H activation should be the most favorite process , but the β-attack can not be excluded a priori. Considering the spatial arrangement of a benzodithiophenebenzothiadiazole ( or benzotriazole , Figure 4a ) fragment , if the thiophene ring is functionalized at the α-position , the βhydrogen atom is in the close proximity to the O-CH 2 - of one alkoxy chain on benzene ring. As a consequence , the through - space dipolar coupling between the thienyl proton and the methylene protons should give rise to a cross-correlation peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum. In the case of βfunctionalization , no Overhauser effect between OCH 2 and thienyl proton can be observed. In the 2D NOESY spectrum of F3 , a cross-peak between the methylene protons at 4.30 ppm and the internal thienyl proton at 8.85 ppm was well evident. Moreover , there was also a cross-peak between the other OCH 2 group at 4.23 ppm and the terminal thienyl proton at 7.47 ppm. Similar trends were also observed for the intermediates F4 and F5. In summary , these spectroscopic data indicate an initial regioregular evolution of the DHAP involving the α positions of the benzodithiophene units. Nevertheless , in advanced stages of the chains ' growth , the number of the free β positions becomes markedly higher than the number of the α positions at the ends of the chains , and the β / α ratio increases as the reaction proceeds ( Figure 6 ). For this reason , the formation of β defects in the polymer backbone may become statistically significant. This observation , together with the detected formation of homocoupling defects F1 , could rationalize the hypsochromic shift of the polymers synthesized by direct arylation in DMAc with respect to the reference P STILLE .

Full device fabrication details can be found in the Experimental Section. The solar cells were prepared according to a procedure that was previously reported to optimized devices based on P STILLE . 22 The active layers ( ∼ 70 nm thick ) were spin - coated on ITO / PEDOT - PSS from chlorobenzene ( CB ) solutions using a polymer / fullerene ratio of 1 : 3. The addition of a 2% ( v / v ) of 1-chloronaphthalene ( CN ) was reported to significantly improve the device performances ( PCE from 2.5 to 4% ).",

    "sentence": "22 A further improvement ( maximum PCE of 5% ) 22 was obtained through an ethanol surface treatment of the active layer that was carried out prior to evaporation of the aluminum cathode. As reported in Table 2 , the photovoltaic parameters of P STILLE are similar to P DA 1-P DA 3-based devices , without CN processing. When the active layer is deposited from CB , the J sc is 4.8 mA / cm^2 for P STILLE and ranges from 3.9 to 4.1 mA / cm^2 for the P DA 1-P DA 3-based devices ( Table 2 ). CN processing induces an almost 2-fold enhancement to 9.8 mA / cm^2 for P STILLE , while the J sc of P DA -s is not significantly improved by this treatment , with J sc values ranging from 4.9 to 5.6 mA / cm^2. The observed enhancement of J sc with CN processing is due to a reduction of phase segregation and a better degree of intermixing between the donor polymer and the acceptor fullerene that induces an enhancement of charge photogeneration. 22,32 Small improvements of the photovoltaic performances were also obtained with ethanol surface treatment. This treatment does not substantially affect the blend morphology ( see Supporting Information ) , but it likely reduces the barrier at the electrodes / active layer interface. 33 Upon CN processing and ethanol surface treatment the PCE for all polymers obtained by DHAP is lower than that of P STILLE ( Table 2 ). Interestingly , the PCE decreases with the polymer molecular weight. This decrease is consistent with previous studies reported in the literature , which suggested that , below M n ≈ 10^000 g / mol , the photovoltaic properties of polymerbased BHJ solar cells are affected by nonoptimal blend morphologies and poor optoelectronic properties. 34-36 It can be seen from Table 2 that , in devices obtained with CN processing and ethanol surface treatment , there is a substantial drop of J sc going from P STILLE to P DA 1-P DA 5 , which is quite significant in P DA 4 and P DA 5. The active layers were analyzed by optical microscopy to check whether such behavior is related to differences in the film - forming properties. Figure 7 shows the typical images obtained for the active layers. The aspect of P DA 1-P DA 3 films is similar to P STILLE active layer , while P DA 4 and P DA 5 active films exhibit a strong segregation on the microscopic scale. Furthermore , a strong scattering background is observed for P DA 5 blends ( Supporting Information ). These features can explain the lower photovoltaic performances of P DA 4 and the even poorer characteristics of P DA 5-based devices. Further support to this hypothesis derives from a deep AFM microscopy analysis of the P STILLE and P DA 1-P DA 3 blends. Figure 8 compares the AFM morphologies of P STILLE and P DA 2 through the CN processing.",

The UV - vis absorption and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry test results show that F atoms in DTff BT unit present an obvious influence on intermolecular effect and molecular energy levels of polymers. Furthermore , the energy loss of two PSCs devices in this work is confirmed to be 0.78 and 0.71 eV , lower than most results based on BDT PSCs devices , which is critical to obtain high PCE PSCs devices with a decent trade - off between J SC and V OC . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have received significant attention due to the potential for the fabrication of light - weight , largearea , and flexible light harvesting devices through low - cost solution processing. 1-6 Among them , bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells based on the blend of donor and acceptor materials have been proved to be one of the most efficient structures , and the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) with fullerene acceptors has achieved over 10% in both single - and multijunction cells. 7-10 However , the classical fullerene acceptors ( for example , PC71BM : [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ) still have intrinsic drawbacks including the relatively narrow absorption region and low molar extinction coefficients , which would cause inefficient harvesting of solar energy. Therefore , the basic optoelectronic properties of donor materials are important and mostly determine photocurrent and photovoltaic efficiencies of polymer solar cells. D-A conjugated polymers including electron - rich and - deficient units along the polymer backbones have been intensively investigated for the convenience of tuning band gap and energy levels through the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) effect. 11,12 However , the design of efficient donor materials is still a challenging task because it should achieve a good balance among all the photovoltaic parameters including open circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short circuit current density ( J SC ) , and fill factor ( FF ) , which are directly proportional to power conversion efficiency ( PCE = J SC × V OC × FF / P in ) , where P in is the input light power.",

The PSCs devices based on PTB7 and PC71BM exhibited excellent photovoltaic property with PCE up to 7.4% . 17 Furthermore , Li and Hou developed twodimensional ( 2D ) conjugated polymers with π-conjugated groups as side chains of BDT unit instead of alkoxy chains to modify the absorption spectra and molecular energy levels , which successfully enhanced the J SC and V OC simultaneously. 18-20 Various π-conjugated substitutions with different electronic properties and steric effect have been investigated as BDT side chains , and some efficient D-A polymers ( for example , PTB7-Th and PBDB-T ) were obtained with PCEs exceeding 10% in fullerene and fullerene - free based solar cells. 21-25 The results reveal that the varieties of π-conjugated substitutions in BDT side chains present a significant influence in optoelectronic properties of the resulted D-A polymers and photovoltaic efficiencies of PSCs. As we all know , the fluorene unit has usually been used as electron - donating moiety to design D-A conjugated polymers due to its rigidity , high hole mobility , and highly conjugated structures. 26,27 Andersson 's group introduced the fluorene unit to design donor materials of PSCs. 28 The resulting polymer PFDTBT exhibited good efficiency with PCE of 2.2% . Next , Andersson reported a series of D-A materials based on fluorene with different alkyl and alkoxy side chains with PCE up to 3.5% . 29 In order to improve the solubility and aggregation properties of polymers , Hou synthesized the D-A copolymer PFDTBT and BisDMO - PFDTBT with the PCE of 4.5% and 3.5% , respectively. 30 Woo also brought the fluorene unit into the backbone of highly crystallized polymers to disrupt partially the interchain organizations of excessive aggregation and improved the PCE from 2.6% to 6.6% . 31 Besides , the derivatives of fluorene ( including PFN and PFN-Br ) were wildly used as interface materials in PSCs field. 32-34 However , to the best of our knowledge , the fluorene unit is generally widely used as the electron - rich unit to construct the polymer backbone , and the photovoltaic polymers with fluorene unit as side chains have not been reported.

Synthesis and Characterization. The structure and synthetic routes of D-A polymers are outlined in Scheme 1. The fluorene - substituted BDT monomer was designed as electron - donating moiety ( D ) , and DTBT and DTff BT are selected as two electron - withdrawing moieties ( A ). These two polymers PFBDT - DTBT and PFBDT - DTff BT were prepared by Stille polymerization in the presence of Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 stabilities of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min -1 . The TGA curves are shown in Figure S1 , and data were collected in Table S1. TGA plots reveal that polymers PFBDT - DTBT and PFBDT - DTff BT exhibit good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures ( T d ) 371 and 392 °C at 5% weight loss under nitrogen , respectively , which indicates that the thermal stability of the polymers is good enough for PSCs applications.

The peaks at 380-480 nm are probably corresponding to the π-π* transition , and the major peaks at 480-730 nm should be attributed to the strong intermolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) effect between the donor and acceptor moieties.

As Figure 1b shows , when the solution is heated from 0 to 100 °C , the shapes of the aggregation peak at 648 nm decreased step by step during the heating process. More importantly , the shoulder peak can be detected even at 100 °C , which indicates that the aggregation of PFBDT - DTff BT was strong even at high temperature ( 100 °C ).

From Figure 5 , we can see that both films of PFBDT - DTBT / PC71BM and PFBDT- DTf f BT / PC71BM display uniform and fine nanoscale structures. As shown in Figure 5 , the root-mean-square ( RMS ) roughness of PFBDT-DTBT:PC71BM and PFBDT- DTff BT : PC71BM are 0.35 and 0.98 nm , respectively. The difference of RMS is probably attributed to the stronger molecular interaction and aggregation ability. However , in the TEM of blend films ( Figure S6 ) , we do not observe this aggregation. We propose it may be related to the miscibility between donors and acceptors as well as the film forming mechanism of BHJ structure. Furthermore , some small holes can be observed in two blend films , which is preferable neither for efficient exciton dissociation nor for balanced charge transport. And the defects in blend films should be blamed partially for the low fill factors of two PSCs devices ( see Table 2 ). Energy Loss Analysis. The high V OC of PFBDT - DTff BT based device would afford a reduced energy loss ( E loss ) , which is defined as E loss = E g - eV OC , where E g is the lowest optical band gap between donor and acceptor materials. 39 In this work , E g is defined to be 1.67 eV from the onset absorption of PC71BM film at 743 nm ( see Figure S7 ). The E loss values of PFBDT- DTff BT based device are calculated to be 0.69 - 0.71 eV , smaller than most of the reported fullerene based PSCs and approaching the empirically low threshold of 0.6 eV ( see Tables 2 and 3 ).",

The three copolymers , namely PDBS - TQx , PDBS - TQxF and PDBS - TzQx , belong to the wide band - gap semiconductor materials family , and they show an absorption edge in the visible region close to 650 nm. In order to tune the position of the polymer energy levels , and in particular to decrease their HOMO energy level , we compare the use of a thiazole spacer sandwiching the electron - deficient moiety as an alternative way to the popular backbone fluorination. PSCs based on a blend of PDBS - TQx and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methylester ( PC71BM ) as an active layer have shown the best device performances with a maximum power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 5.14% for the active area of 0.28 cm^2 ( under standard illumination of AM 1.5G , 1000 W m -2 ). Interestingly this polymer outperforms P3HT:(PC61BM) solar cells used as a reference material in this work. In addition to the thorough characterization data , including among other spectroscopy techniques , XRD , OFET , AFM and nc - AFM , we discuss in detail the relationship between the chemical structures of the three polymers , their optoelectronic properties , the phase separation in blends with PC71BM and their photovoltaic performances . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) are considered as a promising technology for renewable energy sources , 1 owing to their numerous advantages compared to other technologies employing inorganic semi-conductors. They have attracted interest of many academic and industrial research teams 2 since it has been demonstrated that PSCs can be manufactured on lightweight , flexible and biodegradable substrates 3 and that they can be deposited on a large area using printing technologies , which reduces the cost and the energy payback time of the solar cells. 4,5 In the last decade , with the goal to improve the attractiveness of PSCs for future industrial production , many research studies have been focused on the development of more efficient devices by synthesizing new materials , 6,7 optimizing interface layers 8 and designing new device architectures. 9 While conventional bulk - heterojunction devices based on narrow band - gap ( NBG ) polymers in a single cell are now grazing the theoretical PCE limit with efficiencies around 11% , [10][11][12] new approaches based on the multiple absorbing species such as multiple - junction architectures and ternary blend based devices have showed highly promising performances 13,14 with PCE records of 11.83% and 10.50% respectively. 15,16 Tandem devices are fabricated by superposing vertically single bulk - heterojunction solar cells that are electronically connected by an appropriate recombination layer.

Ternary blend devices address a similar issue of a more efficient solar photon harvesting by using multiple absorbing species in a single active layer. Such a ternary solar cell can still benefit the easy fabrication process and has received renewed interest in the last few years. 17,18 For the fabrication of such panchromatic devices there exists a large variety of NBG materials that are capable of absorbing visible and near - infra red light. Most of these polymers show a PCE over 8% in single junction solar cells. [19][20][21] In contrast , the number of wide band - gap ( WBG ) materials capable of harvesting photons at shorter wavelengths and showing sufficiently high performances for use in tandem or multi-junction devices is limited to a few examples. [22][23][24][25] To date , the most used WBG material in panchromatic devices is still poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ). This polymer when blended with fullerene derivatives [6,6]-phenyl-C61butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or the indene - C60 bisadduct ( IC 60 BA ) can achieve a PCE of 5% 22 and 6.5% respectively in a single cell. 26 However P3HT has some limitations regarding the position of its highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level that impedes the achievement of a high open circuit voltage ( V OC ) in solar cells. Only a few WBG polymers can outperform P3HT in the shorter wavelength region ( 350 nm to 650 nm ). 27,28 To improve the currently reported record efficiencies of tandem and multi-junction cells it is now essential to develop new WBG materials as alternatives to P3HT showing better photovoltaic performances. Ideally these materials should combine a wider band - gap ( E opt > 1.9 eV ) , a good mobility of the charge carriers in order to maximize the short - circuit current - density J sc , and a lowlying HOMO energy level 29 that enables to achieve a larger open circuit voltage ( V OC ). In this contribution , we report on the synthesis and characterization of three wide band - gap copolymers ( 1.95 eV < E opt < 2.00 eV ) combining dibenzosilole and quinoxaline moieties. The quinoxaline and dibenzosilole units were linked together either with a thiophene or a thiazole spacer to give the copolymers named PDBS - TQx , PDBS - TQxF , and PDBS - TzQx. The copolymers have been fully characterized optically and electronically prior to their use in bulk - heterojunction solar cells with fullerene derivatives. PDBS - TQx and PDBS - TQxF , that contain thiophene spacers , show a relatively high hole mobility in the organic field effect transistor ( OFET ) configuration with values ranging from 2.5 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 up to 6.5 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 .",

    "sentence": "All the polymers revealed a quite narrow absorption in the visible range with an absorption edge close to 650 nm in the solid state and a lower HOMO energy level than P3HT. The low - lying HOMO energy levels of these copolymers led to an improved V OC in solar cells compared to P3HT. After optimization of the processing conditions , we show that PDBS - TQx , when used in combination with PC71BM , outperforms P3HT in BHJ solar cells leading to a PCE up to 5.14% under the standard illumination of AM 1.5G , 1000 W m -2 ( active area 0.28 cm^2 ). To further replace advantageously P3HT in tandem or ternarybased devices , the WBG materials should possess an intense absorption coefficient in the 350-650 nm region. UV - visible absorption spectra of the copolymers PDBS - TQx , PDBS - TQxF and PDBS - TzQx were recorded in chloroform solutions and in thin films cast from chlorobenzene solutions. The spectra are presented in Fig. 1a and b for the solution and thin films respectively , and the results are summarized in Table 2. The three polymers show quite similar shape absorption spectra both in solution and in thin films. In solution they show the first maximum absorption peak in the UV part located between 381 nm and 406 nm corresponding to the π-π* tran- sitions. They also possess a second peak that is clearly distinguished at longer wavelengths with a λ max comprised between 526 nm and 546 nm. This second absorption band , typical in D-A chemical structures , corresponds to internal charge - transfer transitions ( ICT ) between the electron - rich and the electron - deficient segments. 48 The absorption profiles of the three polymers are shifted toward longer wavelengths going from the solution to the solid state. In thin films , the maximum of the UV absorption peak is slightly red - shifted by 4 nm to 13 nm , whereas the peak corresponding to the ICT absorption is strongly shifted for all the polymers ( by 19 nm for PDBS - TQx , 27 nm for PDBS - TQxF and 43 nm for PDBS - TzQx ). These behaviours indicate the better delocalization of the electrons of the π-conjugated systems in the solid state and they reflect that strong π-stacking interactions occur between polymer chains ( see Fig. 1b ). It could be noticed that all polymers present really similar absorption profiles with identical band - gaps measured in the solid state. The photoluminescence spectra of the polymers were also recorded in solution and in thin films. We observed a strong shift of the emission peaks from circa 630 nm in solution to circa 720 nm in the solid state ( see Fig. S1 † ). This shift is fully consistent with the better interactions between polymer chains in thin films .",

    "sentence": "Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) of the polymers was carried out in a three - electrode cell using an Ag / AgCl reference electrode and a calibration with the ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) redox couple. The cyclic voltammetry curves are shown in Fig. 3a and the electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2. From the CV curves we found that the oxidation process occurred at 0.94 V for PDBS - TQx , 1.09 V for PDBS - TQxF and 1.31 V for PDBS - TzQx. The onset of the reduction potentials of the polymers was found at -1.27 V and -1.28 V for PDBS - TQx and PDBS - TQxF , respectively but this value was shifted at -1.11 V for PDBS - TzQx. From the ionisation potential and the electronic affinity measured by CV , the corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated using the following equations E HOMO = -(E OX + 4.38 ) ( eV ) and E LUMO = -(E RED + 4.38 ) ( eV ). 50 The HOMO energy level of PDBS - TQx was estimated at -5.32 eV. The substitution of the quinoxaline unit with fluorine atoms in PDBS - TQxF induces a down - shift of the HOMO energy level at -5.47 eV. But , as expected , the strongest effect was observed when the thiophene spacers are replaced by thiazole units. Indeed the polymer PDBS - TzQx possesses a HOMO energy level located at -5.69 eV. In contrast , the impact of the different chemical variations on the LUMO levels is relatively weak. PDBS - TQx and PDBS - TQxF have LUMO levels located at circa -3.10 eV and PDBS - TzQx shows a LUMO level at -3.27 eV. Interestingly all the polymers have a HOMO energy level deeper than the one of the P3HT ( E HOMO = -4.90 eV ) 51,52 ( see Fig. 3b ). This feature is expected to give rise to a higher open circuit voltage for the solar cells . In order to investigate the intrinsic difference between the polymers and to better understand how the chemical modifications influence the energy level positions and the electron density distribution , theoretical calculations were performed by density functional theory using the B3LYP hybrid method. To simplify the calculation , only one set of repeating units of each polymer was used for the calculation and the long alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. The optimisation of the geometry was carried out with the data for each monomer deduced from the single crystal X-Ray diffraction. The simulated electron density distribution and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels with the optimized geometry are shown in Fig. 4. The calculated HOMO energy levels of PDBS - TQx , PDBS - TQxF and PDBS - TzQx were -5.27 eV , -5.38 eV and -5.57 eV respectively.

    "sentence": "These values are quite consistent with the experimental ones found from electrochemical measurements. As expected , the three polymers show an electron density distribution of the LUMO energy levels mainly located on the quinoxaline moiety , which is the most electrondeficient unit in the polymer backbone. However we found that the electron density of the HOMO energy level of PDBS - TQx is rather delocalized on the aromatic cores of the polymer backbone including the benzene ring of the quinoxaline. The fluorine substitutions on PDBS - TQxF , that make the quinoxaline unit more electron deficient , slightly transferred the electron density of the HOMO energy level on the dibenzosilole unit. Finally the use of thiazole spacers in PDBS - TzQx induces a similar effect and increases the contribution of dibenzosilole to the HOMO energy level . The charge carrier mobility of the donor polymer is an important parameter that partly governs the performances of BHJ solar cells. A high charge carrier mobility may contribute to improve the J sc and the Fill Factor ( FF ) leading to a higher PCE. The hole mobility of the copolymers was measured in organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) with a bottom gate and bottom contact configuration. The OFET characteristics are presented in Table 3. PDBS - TQx exhibits a hole mobility of 3.0 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Swapping H for F in the quinoxaline unit allows increasing the hole mobility of PDBS - TQxF up to 1.0 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . After thermal annealing a highest value of 4.5 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 was achieved in the linear regime and this value rises at 6.5 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 in the saturated regime ( see the ESI † ). The lower hole mobility ( circa one order ). Indeed it is well - known that the chain length of the deposited polymers is a determining factor in the fabrication of layers with high carrier mobility. High M w fractions can lead to improved charge transport properties by increasing the conjugation length , the probability of the inter-chain charge carriers hopping and by improving the connectivity between domains. [53][54][55] The rather good hole mobility value for the polymers PDBS - TQxF may originate from a larger crystal size that is usually observed with fluorinated copolymers , probably due to increased π-stacking interactions.",

For this polymer a postfabrication thermal annealing treatment was not effective to improve the performances. These results highlight the higher performances of PDBS - TQx , compared to P3HT in solar cells. The improvement mostly originates from the higher V OC of the solar cells fabricated with this material which is higher by 0.2 V compared to P3HT. The substitution of the quinoxaline with fluorine atoms in PDBS - TQxF has a significant effect on the performances. For this polymer the best cell revealed a V OC of 0.81 V , a J SC of 7.27 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 0.51 leading to a PCE of 2.98% . It should however be noticed that after thermal annealing at 120 °C , the performances increased to reach a PCE of 3.19% with a V OC of 0.76 V , a J SC of 7.61 mA cm^-2 and a FF of 0.55.

As for PDBS - TQx , a thermal annealing of the devices did not yield higher performances. The much lower J SC and FF for the PDBS - TzQx - based devices can be explained by their lower charge carrier mobility as demonstrated earlier. However the origin of the drop in the V OC value is not yet fully understood . The morphology of the polymer : PC71BM blend films with the optimized weight ratio was investigated by tapping - mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). The AFM topographic images are shown in Fig. 6. The morphology of pristine polymers with PC71BM shows aggregated domains with diameters around 500 nm for PDBS - TQx , 300 nm for PDBS - TQxF and 260 nm for PDBS - TzQx ( Fig. 6a-e ). This type of phase segregation is expected to be responsible for the enhanced exciton recombination and the dramatic drop in the current density when the polymers are processed without additives. This morphology also explains why our attempts to improve the morphology of the donor - acceptor networks by a simple thermal treatment were not successful. As explained before , with the goal to enhance the miscibility of the two components and to favour the formation of a better interpenetrating donor - acceptor network , we used DIO as a processing additive.",

    "sentence": "11,12 The combination of BDT - TPD or BDT-BT can mitigate the backbone twisting issue which often occurred during polymerization reaction due to the unfavorable interaction between the electron - rich and - deficient units in the backbone. With this design strategy we may obtain increased photovoltaic properties of the resultant polymer. It is well - known that the nanoscale morphology of photoactive layer predominantly influence the photovoltaic performance. Thus , several strategies have been proposed to control the Scheme 1 Article dx.doi.org / 10.1021 / ma5010875 | Macromolecules XXXX , XXX , XXX - XXX B morphology of photoactive layers such as thermal annealing , solvent vapor treatment , and high boiling solvent additives. 13 According to recent reports , the usage of conjugated polyelectrolyte interlayer in alcohol or polar solvents like methanol themselves has positive effects on the device performance. 14 Such solvent exposure on the BHJ photoactive layer can influence the crystallinity and morphology of the photoactive film , which resulted in superior photovoltaic characteristics. 15 In this regard , it will be interesting to study the effect of direct polar solvent exposure on the BHJ photoactive layer on the active layer morphology and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. To address the aforementioned issues , we have synthesized two medium band gap ( MBG ) polymers , P1 and P2 , containing m-ethylhexyloxyphenylthiophene ( m-EHPTh ) linked BDT as an electron - rich and TPD or BT as an electron - deficient units , as shown in Scheme 1. To analyze the influence of sulfur and oxygen intramolecular noncovalent interactions ( INCI ) on the planarity of polymer backbone , the thiophene spacer was introduced between the electron - rich and - deficient units of two polymers. We found that the sulfur atom of thiophene and oxygen atom of carbonyl groups of TPD in P1 has more pronounced interaction than the sulfur atom of thiophene and the oxygen atom of alkoxy groups of BT in P2. This difference lead to enhanced planarity of backbone in P1 and resulted in dominant photovoltaic properties of P1 than P2. Thus , the pristine devices of P1 and P2 showed the PCE of 4.19 and 1.88% with a V oc of 0.91 and 0.71 V , respectively. After treating the active layer with methanol , the PCE of the P1 based PSC significantly increased from 4.19 to 7.14% . . All the polymers were readily soluble in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) , chloroform ( CF ) , and chlorobenzene ( CB ). The weight - average molecular weights ( M w ) of P1 and P2 polymers were 36^000 Da with polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 1.2 and 32^000 Da with PDI of 1.3 , respectively. . The onset of decomposition temperatures ( Td , corresponding to 5% weight loss ) of P1 and P2 are 417 and 337 °C , respectively , indicating their very high thermal stability.",

The UV - vis absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in CF solution and film are shown in Figures 1a and 1b , respectively. P1 and P2 show two distinct absorption characteristics ; the bands in the lower energy region 450-700 nm correspond to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) interaction between electron - rich and - deficient units , and the bands in the higher energy region 300-400 nm are attributed to the π-π* transition of polymer backbone. Interestingly , P1 showed a pronounced vibronic shoulder peak between 590 and 620 nm in both solution and film ; in contrast , P2 did not show such a shoulder peak. In addition , the ICT band of P1 has stronger absorption than its π-π* band , whereas in the case of P2 , the π-π* band has higher absorption intensity than its ICT band. These results suggest that the P1 has more planar backbone structure than that of P2. This can be further supported by the UV - vis absorption spectra of P1 in CF solution at various concentrations. As shown in Figure S7 , the intensity of the shoulder peak becomes slightly more pronounced with the increasing concentration of P1 which was not observed in case of P2. The absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in the film were red - shifted compared to their solution spectra , indicating their efficient π-π stacking in film state. Particularly , the film of P1 shows almost equal relative intensity of the ICT band and the shoulder peak confirms again its more planar nature than P2. Taken together , the results presented suggest that the INCI between sulfur atom of thiophene spacer and the oxygen atom of carbonyl groups in TPD is more pronounced than the INCI between the sulfur atom of thiophene and the oxygen atom of alkoxy groups in BT. Electrochemical Properties. The electrochemical properties of P1 and P2 were measured using cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) ; the corresponding cyclic voltammograms are shown in Figure S8 , and the data are listed in Table 1. The HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were determined from their onset of first oxidation potentials. P1 possesses a deeper HOMO ( -5.42 eV ) than the P2 ( -5.34 eV ) , which may enable a high V oc for the P1 , since V oc values mainly depend on the difference between HOMO energy level of the donor and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of the acceptor materials. This may be due to the existence of higher electron - withdrawing nature of TPD unit in P1 than that of the BT in P2. In addition , P1 and P2 show the HOMO energy level below the air oxidation threshold limit ( 5.2 eV ) , which suggests their high air stability.",

    "sentence": "Their LUMO energy levels were calculated from their optical band gap ( E g opt ) and HOMO energy levels. The LUMO energy level of the donor materials has to be at least 0.3 eV higher than that of the acceptor materials in BHJ PSCs to ensure formation of a downhill driving force for the energetically favorable electron transfer and to overcome the binding energy of the intrachain exciton. P1 and P2 show the LUMO values ( -3.66 and -3.60 eV , respectively ) greater than 0.3 eV of LUMO of PC71BM. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the P1 and P2 clearly indicate their good air stability and efficient exciton dissociation at donor / acceptor interfaces , respectively. 18 Computational Study. Density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations were carried out to further inspect electrochemical properties of P1 and P2 using a suite of Gaussian 09 programs. 19 Becke 's three parametrized Lee-Yang-Parr exchange functional ( B3LYP ) and 6-31G* basis sets were used. Optimized structures , HOMOs , and LUMOs of repeating units of P1 and P2 are shown in Figure 2. The electronic densities of their HOMOs are more populated on the BDT units , and those of the LUMOs are mainly distributed over TPD or BT units , as expected. The HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were calculated to be -4.96 and -4.82 eV , respectively. These results are in agreement with experimental observations of deeper HOMO energy levels in the P1 than the P2. This HOMO difference can be understood by the more electronic participation of the thiophene spacers next to the BT units. In addition , the planarity of the optimized structures of repeating units of P1 and P2 were observed through the dihedral angles between the electron donor and the electron - deficient units. In both P1 and P2 , the dihedral angles between BDT unit and thiophene spacer were similar , 13.4 ° and 15.5 ° , respectively. In contrast , the dihedral angles between thiophene and each electron - deficient unit of P1 and P2 were 0 ° and 9.8 ° , respectively. Hence , the computed dihedral angles suggest enhanced planarity in P1 than in P2 though both electron deficient moieties are planar as we expected. 11,20 As for electrostatic interactions , calculated Mulliken charge distribution shows an almost equal degree of charge separation between the sulfur atom of thiophene and the oxygen atom of each acceptor unit in both repeating units. The larger dihedral angle in P2 than in P1 mainly originated from the steric repulsion between the lengthy hydrocarbon chain of the electron deficient unit and the APTh of the donor. X-ray Diffraction. The crystallinity of the polymers was characterized by the X-ray diffraction technique. Both the polymers are quite low crystalline ( Figure S9 ). From ( 100 ) reflections we estimated similar lamellar domain spacings to be 29.9 Å ( q = 0.21 Å -1 ) for both P1 and P2 , respectively , in the polymer : PC71BM blend films.",

In order to understand the effect of INCI in P1 and P2 on their photovoltaic properties , the BHJ PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / P1 or P2 : PC71BM / LiF / Al and tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G illumination ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). The active layers of the devices were spin - coated from the CB solution of corresponding polymer and PC71BM blend. In order to obtain the best device performance , several device and processing conditions such as polymer to PC71BM ratio , active layer thickness , and processing solvent were systematically optimized. The best photovoltaic properties were obtained with the blend ratio of 1 : 2.5 and 1 : 2 for the P1 and P2 devices , respectively. Figures 3a and 3b show the current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves of best devices of pristine and methanol - treated P1 and P2 devices , and the data are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. The best device of pristine P1 yielded the PCE of 4.19% with the J sc of 9.50 mA / cm^2 , V oc 0.91 V , and FF 48.31% , which is higher than that of the best device of the pristine P2 ( PCE : 1.88% ). This can be explained from its broader absorption spectrum and higher carrier mobilities of the P1 : PC71BM blend than that of the P2 : PC71BM blend. Additionally , the P1 device shows a higher V oc than that of the P2 device due to its deeper HOMO energy level since the V oc mainly depends on the HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor. Because of the higher carrier mobilities of the P1 : PC71BM blend , it shows higher FF and J sc values than those of the P2 : PC71BM blend , which leads to the higher PCE for the P1 device than the P2 device ( vide inf ra ). Recently postdeposition methanol treatment has proven to be an effective method to obtain nanoscale morphology for active layer by controlling the phase separation between donor and acceptor. Methanol has been widely used in surface engineering by incorporation of interlayer in BHJ PSCs. 23 In this regard , we were keen to observe the effect of methanol treatment on the active layer and its correlation on the planarity of polymer backbone , which is the main determining factor of photovoltaic performances. As shown in Figure 3a , after treating the active layer with methanol , the PCE is increased drastically from 4.19 to 7.14% for the P1 device ; in contrast , the PCE is decreased from 1.88 to 1.82% for the P2 device.",

    "sentence": "We conjecture that the increased photovoltaic performance by methanol treatment is mainly related with the planarity of polymer backbone. When polymer chains are planar , the PC71BM molecules may migrate more easily between the polymer chains than the polymers with nonplanar backbones , which then effectively increase the interfacial area between the polymers and the PC71BM molecules with maintaining nanoscopically connected each domain. This is supported by results of the photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching , mobility measurements , and morphology studies ( vide inf ra ). Thus , the PCE of the more planar P1 device is increased more drastically than that of the P2 device. Wetting time is a crucial factor in the methanol treatment to increase the PCE. 24 Thus , the wetting time was optimized for both the P1 and P2 devices. As shown in Table 3 , the PCE of the P1 device is increased from 4.19 to 7.14% with increasing the wetting time from 0 to 20 s due to the increment in J sc ( from 9.50 to 13.20 mA / cm^2 ) and FF ( from 48.3 to 55.9% ). Upon increasing the wetting time further above 20 s , the PCE is gradually decreased due to the decrease in J sc and FF values. In contrast , the P2 device does not show such changes after treating with methanol. This is due to the fact that the migration of PC71BM molecule in the presence of methanol is blocked by unfavorable polymer backbone. It means that the movement of PC71BM molecules in the active layer of the P1 device is more favorable than that in the P2 device in the presence of methanol. As shown in Figures 4a and 4b , a pristine blend of both the polymers covers the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) from 300 to 700 nm , which are well matched with their absorption patterns. Particularly , the P1 device shows the EQE of around 50% in the 300-700 nm region. In contrast for the P2 device , the EQE is decreased to 45% between 600 and 700 nm regions. Very interestingly , after treating the active layer with methanol , the EQE is increased above 65% from 50% for the P1 device ; thus , the J sc is increased 9.50 to 13.20 mA / cm^2. In the case of the P2 device , the EQE does not show much change after treating with methanol. Thus , the efficiency of the P1 device is increased drastically after treating with methanol while that of the P2 device remains similar. The J sc values ( 8.94 and 11.93 mA / cm^2 for pristine and methanol - treated P1 based devices ) calculated from integration of the EQE spectra were well matched with J sc obtained from the J-V measurements , considering the common error of 5-10 % .",

As a result , the UV - vis absorption is continuous blue - shifted , and the band gap increases from 1.57 to 2.04 eV when the chlorinated moieties increased from 0 to 100% . The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) levels of those polymers are decreased by increasing the content of chlorinated moiety , which opens a window to constantly modify the V oc values and eventually meets a balance point for optimized solar energy conversion. The highest power conversion efficiency of 8.31% is obtained by using PBTCl25 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , in which the V oc increased from 0.79 to 0.82 V after 25% chlorinated monomer involved in copolymerization.

To solve the increasingly serious energy crisis and the environmental problem caused by conventional energy , searching for and developing green renewable energy such as solar energy are very necessary and important. The past two decades has seen an enormous emergence and development of polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) in both academic research and industrial application owing to their tremendous advantages compared with the traditional silicon solar cells. Organic photovoltaic cells ( OPVs ) show advantages which include low cost , lightweight , solution processing ability , and flexibility. In particular , the creation of the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) system , which is usually employed with conjugated polymer as the electron donor and fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor , is considered as a landmark in the studies of OPVs. 1,2 Particularly , the extensive research on the donor - acceptor ( D- A ) conjugated polymers 3-8 has greatly enhanced the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSCs in the past decades. Considered the three main factors related to the PCE of polymer solar cellsthe short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and fill factor (FF)the simultaneous enhancement of those factors becomes the basic goal when designing the new polymer for solar energy conversion.

At the same time , it is important to maintain a minimum energy offset between the LUMO levels of the donor and fullerene acceptor in order to provide a sufficient driving force for an effective charge separation. 15 That means an ideal design of low band gap polymer for high efficient solar energy conversion would be modestly lower the HOMO level of a donor material with minimal effect on its LUMO level to achieve optimized open circuit voltage and efficient charge carrier transfer between D-A layer interface. The PTB family polymers with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) and thieno [3,4-b]thiophene ( TT ) units are one of the most efficient classes of D-A materials and have drawn a vast majority of attention and interest in the past several years. 16-27 BDT , as a main building block of these polymers , has structural features including extended conjugations , high planarity , and small steric hindrance with adjacent units.

Optical and Electrochemical Properties. Figure 2 shows the comparison of the ultraviolet / visible ( UV - vis ) absorption spectra of the polymers both in dilute chloroform ( 10^-6 mol L -1 ) and in thin films. From PBTCl , PBTCl75 , PBTCl50 , PBTCl25 , PBTCl20 , and PBTCl10 to PTB7-Th , gradually red - shifted absorption peaks are observed as the chlorine content decreases , indicating that the packing of the polymers is highly affected by the chlorine and fluorine content. As the content of chlorine is increased in the copolymer , the twist angle between the donor and acceptor is increased due to the steric hindrance of chlorine atoms , which leads to a diminishment in the planarity and conjugation of the copolymers. In chloroform solution , all the polymers show π-π* transition peaking from 624 to 697 nm and vibronic shoulders from 574 to 633 nm , respectively. The intensity of the vibronic shoulder is weaker than the main peak when the content of chlorine is less than 25% , and its intensity grows as the chlorine content increases and exceeds the main peak when the content of chlorine is more than 50% . The results indicate that those polymers in solution already exist in very strong aggregation when the ratio of chlorine and fluorine reaches at some degree , such as 50% chlorinated monomers in this case , but the majority of chlorine substitution in terpolymer will weaken the intermolecular aggregation by the steric hindrance of chlorine atoms and eventually lead to the blue - shift of the absorption spectra in solution. Therefore , the controlling of different halogen atoms in terpolymer is critical for suitable intermolecular interactions , and with proper ratio of chlorine , the lower HOMO can be achieved without destroying the aggregations of the fluorine - substituted polymers. The absorptions of the polymer thin films exhibit similar optical properties to that in solution but with obvious red - shift of the main peaks. The main and shoulder peaks are red - shifted about 7-20 nm and 17-29 nm from the solution to film , respectively. The relative intensities of the π-π* transition peak are the strongest peaks in thin films of all polymers even the content of chlorine is the majority in copolymers , which imply the ordered aggregation and strong π-π stacking of polymer in thin films.",

The optimized thicknesses of the active layers varied from 90 to 170 nm due to the different molecular weight. Figure 5a and Table 3 present the current density - voltage ( J- V ) curves and the performance of the devices from all the polymers with different chlorine ratio. As expected , when the content of chlorine moiety is increased in the terpolymer , the V oc exhibits a higher value due to the relative lower - lying HOMO energy levels of the donor materials. 51 PBTCl showed a V oc of 0.92 V , which is 0.13 V larger than that obtained from the PTB7 - Th. Interestingly , when the content of chlorine moiety is about 25% , the PSC device based on PBTCl25 gives the highest PCE in those polymers , which is 8.31% with a V oc of 0.82 V , a J sc of 15.31 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 66.19% . Compared with PTB7-Th , the PCE of terpolymer PBTCl25 is about 5% increasing after appropriate chlorinated moiety added into the polymer chain , which also indicated that the chlorination could be an effective method to promote the solar energy conversion by enlarge the open circuit voltage with minimal effluence of other factors or even enhancement at same time. Figure 5b shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of all polymers. The EQE spectrum displayed a broad photoresponse from 300 to 800 nm. The maximal EQE value of polymer PBTCl25 reaches about 70% from 630 to 700 nm , and the integral current density calculated based on the EQE curve is 15.05 mA cm^-2 . The deviations between the measured J sc values and the J sc values calculated from the EQE spectra are within 5% , showing a good agreement of the photovoltaic results. The hole mobility of the copolymers was tested by the SCLC method with the single carrier devices ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PBTClx : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag.

The films were prepared by spin - coating PBTClx : PC71BM blend following the method for the solar cell devices. As shown in Figure 6a-c GIWAXS Analysis. The molecular orientation of PBTClx polymer chains in the PBTClx : PC71BM blend films was studied by grazing incidence wide - angle X-ray scattering ( GIWAXS ). Figure 7 shows 2D GIWAXS patterns and corresponding q r and q z linecuts of the films of four conjugated polymers , PBTCl , PBTCl75 , PBTCl25 , and PTB7-Th , blended with PC71BM. Obvious diffraction peaks of the blended films were observed around q r ≈ 0.30 Å -1 ( Figure 7e ) and could be assigned to the ( 10 ) reflection of the 2D hexagonal lattice and correspond to the lattice parameters of a hexagonal array , L 0 , of 23.5 , 23.7 , 25.2 , and 24.8 Å , respectively. This revealed their semicrystalline nature and preferential face-on orientation in the blended films. As the degree of chlorine substitution increases , these scattering peaks shift to a slightly higher q r ( 0.308 Å -1 for PBTCl , 0.306 Å -1 for PBTCl75 , 0.288 Å -1 for PBTCl25 , and 0.293 Å -1 for PTB7-Th ). Moreover , the π-π stacking scatterings were only observed at q z = 1.58 Å -1 in the blended films of PBTCl25 and PTB7-Th ( 3.40 Å for both polymers ) and remain unchanged upon the substitution. For PBTCl only with chlorine substitution , the π-π stacking distances slightly increased to 3.43 Å from the GIWAXS measurement. Apparently , the chlorine substitution just increases the packing distance of polymer chains a little bit in the blended films , rather than having significant influence on molecular packing. From the full width at half - maximum ( FWHM ) of these scattering peaks , it is evident that PBTCl25 exhibits an improved crystallinity in contract to the other three polymers. Both the improved molecular ordering and face-on molecular orientation facilitated the interchain π-electron transport in these conjugated polymer films and led to the high power conversion efficiency of 8.31% in the PBTCl25 : PC71BM - based device . The goal of the current work has been to improve the photovoltaic performance in the electron donor polymers based on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) and thieno [3,4b]thiophene ( TT ) units system. We want to take the advantage of steric effects of chlorine atoms in the polymer systems , which included large band gap , suitable HOMO and LUMO levels , and higher V oc value. We propose that the number of TT-Cl groups should be controlled very carefully to reach the most optimized morphology and planarity of the conjugated system , through a triple component copolymerization approach with different amounts of TT-Cl and TT-F , to realize a better photovoltaic performance in the fabrication of solar cell device.",

T g was not observed in the DSC thermogram. Good thermal stability of the resulting copolymer prevents the deformation of the copolymer morphology and the degradation of the polymeric active layer under applied electric fields . The photophysical characteristic of the polymer DPAV-PT was investigated by UV - Vis absorption spectra in dilute chloroform solution and in solid film spinning - coated on a quartz substrate. Fig. 3 shows the UV - Vis absorption spectra of the polymer solution and film. In solution , DPAV-PT shows an absorption peak at ca. 378 nm and a shoulder at ca. 502 nm. The peak of 378 nm belongs to the absorption of the diphenylamine-vinylene conjugated side chains , and the 502 nm shoulder peak could be ascribed to the p-p* transition absorption of the conjugated polythiophene main chains. The main chain absorption of the polymer film in the visible region got broadened , red - shifted in comparison with that of the polymer solution , because of the aggregation and stronger interchain interactions between the conjugated main chains of the conjugated polymer.

Both the presence of the OTS monolayer at the polymer / dielectric interface and the thermal annealing increase surface smoothness of DPAV-PT thin films. As-spun films of DPAV-PT are always more rough than those of annealed thin films , independent of substrate chemistry. The morphology of the films is in agreement with their trend of charge transport performances. The hole mobility was increased after device annealed and it was apparently correlated with the surface morphology , indicating a strong relationship between morphology and device performances . In summary , we have synthesized a new side chain conjugated polythiophene derivative , DPAV-PT , by the Stille coupling reaction. The polymer possesses good solubility in common organic solvents. DPAV-PT film exhibited broad absorption in the visible region from 300 nm to 650 nm , a relatively low HOMO level , which is beneficial for the air - stability and the increase of V oc of the PSC. A DPAV-PT based polymer solar cell afforded a PCE of 0.7% under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 , a FET device demonstrated an average hole mobility of 6.1 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 after 180 °C annealing.

Among these polymers , P-1c exhibited the highest hole mobility up to 1.36 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . PSCs based P-1b:PC71BM demonstrated the highest V oc up to 0.98 V. P-1a:PC71BM based PSCs gave the highest power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.41% , which is the highest value among solar cells with benzothiadiazole-and silafluorene - containing polymers as the donor material . In recent years , the research on polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) has experienced a rapid development since a large number of new donor - acceptor ( D-A ) alternating conjugated polymers have been synthesized and used as donor component of the active layer. 1-8 Donor - acceptor design is a very appealing design style ; one can easily tune the absorption and energy level of polymers by changing the donor or / and acceptor unit. 9,10 Benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( BT ) is a commonly used strong acceptor unit , as shown in Chart 1 , including the parent BT five kinds of derivatives , namely , BT , 11-16 5-alkoxybenzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( ABT ) , 17 5,6-di(alkoxy)benzo[c] [1,2,5]-thiadiazole ( DABT ) , 1^8 , 1^9 5-fl uo ro be nz o[ c ] [1,2,5]-thiadiazole ( FBT ) , 17,20-23 and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( DFBT ) 24-27 have been used for the synthesis of donor- acceptor ( D-A ) alternating conjugated polymers for PSCs. The introduction of two flexible alkoxy chains on the BT unit can increase the solubility of polymers without interfering the ordered packing of polymer chains. 18,28 The introduction of two fluorine atoms in the 5,6-positions of BT unit can lower the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the resulted conjugated polymers to achieve higher open circuit voltage ( V oc ) as well as increase the intramolecular polymer chain interaction to afford higher hole mobility and PSC performance. [24][25][26][27]29 However , compared with nonfluorinated conjugated polymers , the corresponding fluorinated conjugated polymers usually exhibited much poorer solubility. 30 To achieve high performance polymer donor materials , careful side chain design is usually required to balance the solubility and the chain packing of polymers.",

As shown in Chart 2 , the first SiF and BT based conjugated polymer PBSDTBT with a number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of 15 kDa was prepared by Leclerc et al. and a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 1.6% was achieved. 31 Later , Cao et al. reported the PCE of high molecular weight PSiF - DBT based PSCs could reach 5.4% . 32 We previously reported the synthesis of SiF and 5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole based conjugated polymer P2 , and P2 based PSCs gave a PCE of 6.05% . 33 You et al. have recently shown that the introduction of fluorine atom onto the polymer backbone can lower the HOMO level of polymers to acquire high V oc and suppress the charge recombination to enhance short circuit current ( J sc ) and fill factor ( FF ). 20,23 At the beginning of this research , we first designed and synthesized DFBT and SiF based polymer PSiF - DTDFBT , whose structure is shown in Chart 2. However , PSiF - DTDFBT is unfortunately insoluble in any organic solvent even at elevated temperature. As we known , conjugated polymers are of rod - liked structures , in order to endow them with good solubility , flexible side chains are required to act as the inherent solvent. 34-36 To achieve soluble polymers , we for the first time designed and synthesized 5-alkoxy-6-fluorobenzo-[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole ( AFBT ) and SiF based conjugated polymer PSiF - DTAFBT. Because of the intramolecular S-O supramolecular interaction , the replacement of one fluorine atom on DFBT unit with alkoxy substituent can markedly enhance the solubility of polymers without interfering the close packing of polymer chains in the solid state. 18,28,37 To study the influence of side chains on the performance of PSCs , we have synthesized three polymers with different alkoxy substituent on the BT unit. These polymers are of high molecular weight and fully soluble in organic solvents such as chlorobenzene ( CB ) and dichlorobenzene ( DCB ). Pure polymer films exhibited field effect transistor ( FET ) hole mobilities ranging from 1.51 × 10^-3 to 1.36 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which match the electron mobility of PC71BM. Bulk heterojunction PSCs based on these polymers and PC71BM exhibited high V oc up to 0.98 V. A high PCE up to 6.41% has been obtained. To the best of our knowledge , a PCE of 6.41% is the best result for PSCs based on silafluorene and benzothiadiazole containing polymers , indicating these polymers are promising donor materials for high efficiency PSCs. Starting from commercially available 4,5-difluorobenzene-1,2diamine ( 1 ) , 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole ( 4 ) was synthesized according to the literature procedures.",

Bromination of compounds 5a , 5b , and 5c with NBS in chloroform containing a few drops of acetic acid as the catalyst afforded monomers M-1a , M-1b , and M-1c , respective , in yields of 91-99 % . Suzuki polycondensations of M-1a , M-1b , and M-1c with 9,9-dioctyl-9H-silafluorene-2,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester ) were carried out with Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as the catalyst precursor and tetrabutylammonium bromide as the phase transfer catalyst in a solvent mixture of aqueous NaHCO 3 and toluene to afford polymers P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c , respectively , in yields of 82-90 % . Since the introduction a flexible alkoxy chain on the benzothiadiazole ring , all the as-synthesized polymers are fully soluble in CB , DCB , and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene ( TCB ) at elevated temperature. Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions , which were measured by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) at 150 °C with TCB as an eluent and narrowly distributed polystyrenes as the calibration standards , are summarized in Table 1. P-1a with an octyloxy chain on the benzothiadiazole unit showed a M n of 34.8 kg / mol and a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 2.31. Of the three polymers , P-1b and P-1c with branched alkoxy chain on benzothiadiazole unit were better soluble in hot toluene , which was the organic solvent used for Suzuki polycondensation , allowing us to achieve high molecular weight polymers. P-1b showed a M n of 97.8 kg / mol and a PDI of 3.68 , and P-1c showed a M n of 114.9 kg / mol and a PDI of 2.15. Thermo gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) were used to investigate the thermal properties of these polymers. Under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C / Min , all the three polymers exhibited good thermal stability with the 5% decomposition temperature up to 357 °C for P-1a , 338 °C for P-1b , and 338 °C for P-1c. DSC measurements under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C / Min in the range of 20 to 300 °C also showed that there was no obvious glass transition for all the three polymers. Powdery XRD measurement ( Figure 1 ) was used to investigate the packing of polymer chains in the solid state. All these polymers showed one diffraction peak at small angle region and one broad diffraction peak at wide angle region.",

Optical Properties. UV - vis absorption spectra of polymers P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c in DCB solutions at 100 °C and as thin films are shown in Figure 2. To eliminate the influence of polymer chain aggregation in solution at room temperature , the UV - vis absorption spectra of polymer solutions were therefore measured at 100 ° C. Both in solutions and as thin films , all the three polymers exhibited two absorption peaks , and their locations are summarized in Table 2. Compared with their solution absorption spectra , the corresponding film ones were red - shifted due to the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. The film absorption onsets ( λ edge ) of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c were 624 , 621 , and 618 nm , respective. The increasing of the volume of substituent group on the benzothiadiazole moiety could increase the π-π stacking distance of polymer chains in films and resulted in a blue - shift of the absorption peak. The optical band gaps ( E g,opt ) of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c films were therefore calculated to be 1.99 , 1.99 , and 2.00 eV , respectively , according to the equation : E g,opt = 1240 / absorption onset. Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical properties of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) using a standard three electrodes electrochemical cell. As shown in Figure 3 , these three polymers exhibited quasi reversible redox processes. The onset oxidation potentials of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c are 0.83 , 0.85 , and 0.88 V , respectively. HOMO levels of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c were determined , using the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71 ) , to be -5.54 , -5.56 , and -5.59 eV , respectively. LUMO levels of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c were therefore calculated according to the equation E LUMO = E HOMO + E g,opt to be -3.55 , -3.57 , and -3.59 eV , respectively. The data are also summarized in Table 2. The above results indicated that the introduction of big volume alkoxy chain on the mono fluoro benzothiadiazole unit can only slightly lower the HOMO energy level of polymers. Their low - lying HOMO level is favorable for achieving PSCs with higher V oc .",

The hole mobility of polymer films is usually related to two main factors , namely , the π-π stacking distance and molecular weight of polymers. Usually shorter π-π stacking distance and higher molecular weight are prone to endow polymer films with higher hole mobility. 39 The π-π stacking distance of P1-a is shorter than that of P1-c , but the molecular weight of P1-a is much smaller than that of P1-c. Therefore , it is reasonable that the mobility of P1-c is larger that of P-1a. Photovoltaic Properties. Photovoltaic properties were investigated in a device configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / interfacial layer / Al. The thickness of active layer was about 100 nm. Two different interfacial layers , LiF and FN - C60 , were tested. As shown in Chart 3 , FN - C60 is an alcoholsoluble cationic fullerene derivative , which can be spin - coated atop the active layer without damaging the underlayer. We have screened the weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM , the concentration of blend solutions , the spin - coating speed , and the volume of 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) additive to achieve the better device performance. The preliminary results are summarized in Table 4. For all the three polymers , a polymer to PC71BM weight ratio of 1 : 3 gave the best photovoltaic performances. For P-1a , devices fabricated from DCB solutions using LiF as the interfacial layer for cathode gave a PCE of 4.56% with a V oc of 0.91 V , a J sc of 9.46 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.53. When DIO ( 2.0% , by volume ) was used as the processing additive , the PCE was slightly enhanced to 5.80% . The increasing of PCE was mainly attributed to the increasing of J sc and FF. When FN - C60 was used as the interfacial layer instead of LiF , the PCE was further increased to 6.41% , accompanied by the simultaneously increasing of the V oc , J sc , and FF. It is believed that the use of FN - C60 as the interfacial layer for cathode can enhance the interfacial contact , electron transportation , and collection.",

For P-1c , devices fabricated from DCB solutions containing DIO ( 2.0% , by volume ) also gave the best device performance with a PCE of 5.06% , a V oc of 0.96 V , a J sc of 8.54 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.62. The trend of J sc for the devices is P-1a > P-1c > P-1b , which is inconsistent with the trend of hole mobility of the FET devices based on these polymers. The inconsistency is probably due to that the FET mobility is measured for the pure polymer films in FET devices. Namely , the FET mobility reflects the transport property along the thin polymer film. The short circuit current ( J sc ) of solar cells is related to the transport property of polymer : PC71BM blend instead of pure polymer films. The J sc is mainly related to the nanostructures of polymer : PC71BM blend films. The above preliminary device results indicated that the substituent on the benzothiadiazole unit had significant influence on the performance of PSCs. Devices based on the monooctyloxy-and monofluoro substituted benzothiadiazole containing conjugated polymer P-1a gave the best device performance , even where the molecular weight of P-1a was the lowest one among the three polymers. Further increasing the photovoltaic performance was anticipated after intensive device optimization. J-V curves for the solar cells are found in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 6 , external quantum efficiencies ( EQE ) were measured to examine the accuracy of J sc of devices fabricated under the optimized conditions for each polymer. All polymers exhibited broad photo to current responses in the range of 350 to 700 nm. In the range of 400 to 600 nm , the EQE value of P-1a is higher than 60% with the maximum close to 70% . For P-1b and P-1c , these two polymers exhibited similar EQE curves , in the range of 400 to 600 nm EQE values are around 50% . For all the three polymers , the J sc calculated from the integration of EQE curves matched well with that obtained from J-V measurements. This good agreement could confirm the accuracy of PCE obtained from J-V measurements. Film Morphology. DIO is a higher boiling point solvent than the processing solvent DCB , exhibits better solubility for PC71BM , and can be used as additive to affect the morphology of polymer : PC71BM blend films. 18,40 In previous studies , it has been shown that polymer component can form connected fibrous network when using DIO as the processing additive.",

Recently , we reported a series of star - shaped oligomers and polymers and hyperbranched polymers based on porphyrin as efficient red light - emitting materials. 3 OFET devices made using porphyrin small molecules exhibit carrier mobilities up to 0.2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . 4 However , there have been few reports in which porphyrin polymers were used in OFETs as active layers. The device performance based on the porphyrin polymers is quite poor. For example , OFETs made using a porphyrin-diacetylene polymer give mobilities of 1 × 10^-7 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 at room temperature and 2 × 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 at 175 ° C. 5 Organic solar cells using porphyrin - containing small molecules , oligomers , and polymers as active layers give low power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ).",

    "sentence": "Another monomer diethynylporphyrin 5 was synthesized in high yield from zinc dibromoporphyrin 3 by Sonogashira coupling with trimethylsilylacetylene ( TMSA ) , followed by removal of the protecting groups with tetrabutylammonium fluoride ( TBAF ). All new compounds have been characterized by 1H NMR , 13 °C NMR , MS and elemental analysis. The data are consistent with the proposed structures. Scheme 2 shows the synthesis of the porphyrin polymers as well as the small molecule reference. The reference compound 0 was synthesized in high yield by coordination reaction of porphyrin1withzincacetate.Thesingle-bondlinkedporphyrin-DTT copolymer ( I ) was synthesized by Stille coupling reaction between dibromoporphyrin 3 and DTT ditin. Two different strategies were employed to synthesize triple - bond linked porphyrin - DTT polymer ( IIa and IIb ). As shown in Scheme 2 , different monomers were employed for the polycondensation based on Sonogashira coupling reaction. The monomers are zinc dibromoporpyrin 3 and diethynyl dithienothiophene in route a , while they are zinc diethynylporphyrin 5 and dibromodithienothiophene in route b. Polymers IIa and IIb are obtained through these two routes , respectively. All these polymers have good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , THF , and toluene. All the polymers can be readily processed to form smooth and pinhole - free films upon spin - coating. The 3,4,5-tris(dodecyloxy)phenyl groups at Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using polystyrene standards as calibrants ( Table 1 ). Polymer I has a M n of 46^500 , corresponding to a degree of polymerization of ca. 25. Polymers IIa and IIb show M n values of 12^700 and 15^300 , corresponding to degrees of polymerization of ca. 7 and 8 , respectively. The single - bond linked porphyrin - DTT copolymer I has a much higher M n value than the triple - bond linked porphyrin - DTT polymers IIa and IIb ; IIb has a higher M n than IIa. This is probably related to a side reaction involving the ethynyl groups. Under the same reaction conditions of Sonogashira coupling , oxidative coupling of ethynyl groups usually occurs as a side reaction to give a butadiyne. 14 Diethynylporphyrin undergoes oxidative coupling with more difficulty than diethynyldithienothiophene due to the increased steric hindrance between larger porphyrin units. This butadiyne byproduct will reduce the amount of the ethynyl group to react with bromo segments. Furthermore , the butadiyne byproduct of diethynyldithienothiophene has a low solubility and prevents the polymer chain growth in reaction system. In comparison with IIa , IIb exhibits higher molecular weight , better elemental analysis , and red - shifted absorption , suggesting that the second route is more preferable. A similar phenomenon was found by Krebs et al. in synthesis of zinc porphyrin linked poly(phenyleneethynylene ). 15 The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) under nitrogen.",

While the polymer samples were heated , glass transitions were observed at 180 ( I ) and 130 °C ( IIb ) , but no melting point , suggesting that the polymers are amorphous. The higher decomposition temperature and higher glass - transition temperature of I are probably related to its higher molecular weight. Absorption and Fluorescence Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV - vis absorption spectra of the porphyrin polymers as well as the porphyrin small molecule in solution. The small molecule reference shows a sharp Soret band at 412 nm and a Q-band at 538 nm , which is a typical absorption profile for porphyrin compounds. All the polymers show absorptions in the regions of Soret band and Q-band. Compared to the reference absorption , the Soret band and Q-band of the polymers are broadened. In comparison with that for the small molecule reference 0 , the absorption spectrum of the single - bond linked porphyrin - DTT polymer I exhibits a red shift of ca. 24 nm , caused by the larger conjugation of the polymer. The Soret band and Q-band of the triple - bond linked porphyrin - DTT polymer IIa further red shift ca. 28 and 94 nm , respectively ; the Q-bands are broadened and stronger , compared to that for the single - bond linked counterpart I. A similar phenomenon was observed in porphyrin-thiophene polymers. 10a In polymer I , steric hindrance between directly linked porphyrin and DTT units leads to twisted main chain and limited conjugation ; while in polymer IIa , the triple - bond linker between porphyrin and DTT units reduces the steric hindrance and , therefore , promotes coplanarity and extended π-conjugation. Interestingly , the Soret band and Q-band of the triple - bond linked porphyrin - DTT polymer IIb , synthesized by route b , exhibit red shift of 10 and 47 nm respectively , compared to IIa , synthesized by route a. This result is consistent with the GPC measurements which show that IIb possesses a higher molecular weight than IIa does. The UV - vis spectra of polymer I and IIb in thin film are shown in Figure 5. The absorption spectrum of polymer I in thin film is similar to that in solution , which is probably related to the twisted main chain. However , the Soret band and Q-band of IIb are broadened and red shift 18 and 57 nm respectively , compared to that in solution. It is worth noting that the Q-band of IIb in thin film is located at 650-850 nm and is much stronger than that in solution. This is beneficial to sunlight harvesting because the solar emission spectrum is peaked at 600-800 nm.",

Cyclic voltammograms of the polymers are illustrated in Figure 7.

The output curve shows good saturation behavior with clear saturation currents. Table 2 summarizes the performance of OFETs based on I and IIb before and after annealing. Interestingly , the device performance of the two polymers shows different trends with thermal annealing. The OFET based on I exhibits a mobility of 5.0 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with current on / off ratio of 4 × 10^4 at room temperature ; the thermal annealing at 175 °C leads to improved performance with a mobility of 2.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and current on / off ratio of 2 × 10^5 . The OFET based on IIb exhibits a mobility of 1.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with current on / off ratio of 2 × 10^3 and a low threshold voltage of ca. -3.3 V at room temperature ; the thermal annealing at 80 °C leads to decreased performance with a mobility of 5.4 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and current on / off ratio of 1 × 10^3 . IIb shows higher mobility than I at room temperature , probably because it has more coplanar and extended π-conjugated main chain and stronger aggregation and intermolecular interaction in thin film , as suggested by UV data of thin films. To understand the effect of thermal annealing on the device performance , we employed X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to gain insight into the thin film morphology. The XRD patterns for thin films of I and IIb before and after annealing ( see Supporting Information Figure S1 ) show only very broad peaks , typical for amorphous materials. This result is consistent with high T g s of the polymers ( Figure 3 ). From AFM images ( Figure S2 in Supporting Information ) , no crystalline domains were observed for all the thin films , consistent with the XRD and DSC results. However , the thermal annealing does exert somewhat impact on the thin film morphology. Some defects were observed from the film of I at room temperature , while the film becomes more uniform and smooth with lower defect density after annealing at 175 ° C. The film of IIb before annealing is more uniform and smooth than that after annealing at 80 ° C. The FET device performance is strongly related to the film morphology and quality ; the charge transport is influenced by the defect density which could trap a large amount of charge carriers. Thus , thermal annealing leads to different film quality and therefore , different device performance. Photovoltaic Cells.",

In this case , the π-orbital overlap between neighboring aromatic units was increased in turn , leading to regular changes in the frontier orbital energy levels. The absorption peak wavelengths redshifted from 534 to 568 to 631 nm ; the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy levels increased from -5.44 to -5.35 to -5.21 eV and band gaps decreased from 1.96 to 1.82 to 1.78 eV , for P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) , and P(BDT-TT-BT) , respectively. The photovoltaic power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of solar cells based on the polymers as donor and [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor varied from 2.81% for P(BDT-F-BT) to 3.72% for P(BDT-T-BT) to 4.93% for P(BDT-TT-BT) , depending on the π-bridge in the polymer backbones. 31 and 2-octyl-1-dodecyl bromide 35 were synthesized according to the literatures. Tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) was dried over Na / benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. Other reagents and solvents were commercial grade and used as received without further purification. All reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere. Molecular weights of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) method on Waters 515-2410 with polystyrenes as reference standard and tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) as an eluent. All new compounds were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra ( NMR ) recorded on a Bruker AV 600 spectrometer in CDCl3at room temperature. Chemical shifts of 1H NMR were reported in ppm. Splitting patterns were designated as s ( singlet ) , d ( doublet ) , t ( triplet ) , m ( multiplet ) , and br ( broad ). Elemental analyses were performed on a Flash EA 1112 analyzer or Elementar vario EL III. Thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA , Netzsch TG209C ) measurements were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C / min. UV - vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu spectrometer model UV - 3150.",

Higher yield of P(BDT-TT-BT) was achieved with the catalyst of Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 / ( o-tol ) 3 P. All starting materials , reagents , and solvents were carefully purified , and all procedures were performed under an air - free environment. P(BDT-TT-BT)-EH was insoluble , and can not be further characterized. To resolve this problem , P(BDT-TT-BT) with longer branched 2-octyldodecyloxy groups on BDT segment was designed and synthesized. All the polymers except P(BDT-TT-BT)-EH can be readily dissolved in common solvents , such as chloroform , toluene , THF and chlorobenzene , and processed to form smooth and pinhole - free films upon spin - coating. The structure of P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) , and P(BDT-TT-BT) were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C / min. The three polymers have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures corresponding to 5% weight loss at 332 , 327 , and 320 °C , respectively , as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 3 shows absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solution ( 1 mg / 100 mL ) and as spin - coated films on quartz substrates. Table 1 summarizes the optical data , including the absorption peak wavelengths ( λ abs ) , absorption edge wavelengths ( λ onset ) , and the optical band gap ( E g opt ). All of the absorption spectra recorded from dilute chloroform solutions feature three absorption bands : the first one around 345 nm , the second one at 360-480 nm , which can be assigned to localized π-π* transitions , and the third broader band from 480 to 700 nm in the long wavelength region , corresponding to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between donor and acceptor units. The difference in position and intensity of the absorptions are mainly duo to the different structures of the π-bridges in the polymers. The absorption spectra of the three polymers in the solid film were similar to their corresponding solution spectra , with obviously red - shifts ( ca. 12-19 nm ) of their absorption maxima , indicating intermolecular interactions existing in the solid state. In addition , these polymers all displayed a vibronic shoulders in films at 578 , 616 , and 631 nm , respectively , implying that strong π-π stacking between the polymeric backbones have formed ordered arrangement in their solid films.",

Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry has been employed and considered as an effective tool in investigating electrochemical properties of conjugated oligomers and polymers. 37 From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammogram , energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels can be readily estimated , which correspond to ionization potential ( IP ) and electron affinity ( EA ) , respectively. 26,38 Cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films are shown in Figure 4. From the value of E ox and E red of the polymers , the HOMO and the LUMO as well as the electrochemical bandgaps ( E g ec ) were calculated and also listed in Table 1. The LUMO energy levels of P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) and P(BDT-TT-BT) are very close. This phenomenon indicates that different πbridges do not significantly affect the LUMO levels of the D-π-A polymers. The LUMO energy levels of the polymers are all located within a suitable range ( from -3.44 to -3.54 eV , Table 1 ) and are significantly higher - lying than that of PC71BM ( ca. -3.91 eV ) ; 40 thus , efficient charge transfer ( excitons dissociation ) could be expected to occur in their corresponding devices. 1,2,5 From the comparison with P(BDT-F-BT) , it was noticed that the π-bridges of thiophene and thieno [3,2b]thiophene lowered band gap of P(BDT-T-BT) and P(BDT-TT-BT) by increasing the HOMO energy level of the polymer from -5.44 eV ( P(BDT-F-BT) ) to -5.35 eV ( P(BDT-T-BT) ) , and to -5.21 eV ( P(BDT-TT-BT) ). The electrochemical band gaps of the polymers are well matched with their optical band gaps within the experimental error. Theoretical Calculations. To evaluate the impact of the different π-bridges on molecular architecture and consequently on the optoelectronic properties of the copolymers , density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations were performed to verify stationary points as stable states for the optimized conformations and single point energies , with a molecular main chain length n = 1 , at B3LYP / 6-311++G(3df , 3pd ) level of theory in vacuum using the Gaussian 03 program package. 41 The final energies were calculated as the sum of single point and zero point energies. In particular , the HOMO and LUMO level positions and related electron distributions were calculated. Moreover , all the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups in the calculation to avoid excessive computation demand . Optimized geometries of the three copolymers in ground state are shown in Figure 5. Calculated dihedral angles , bond angle and corresponding HOMO , LUMO levels and bandgaps ( E g cal ) are summarized in Table 2.",

The short - circuit currents of PSCs based on the polymers increased from 6.50 to 9.45 to 11.34 mA cm^-2 , which is consistent with the lowered band gaps ( from 1.96 to 1.82 to 1.78 eV ) and enhanced extinction coefficients ( from 31 to 44 to 51 cm^-1 g^-1 L ). Although the relative low open - circuit voltage , P(BDT-TT-BT) exhibited the highest PCE of 4.93% in all the three aromatic rings bridged polymers.

The power conversion efficiency is 0.25% under AM 1.5 simulated sun light ( 100 mW / cm^2 ).

From the viewpoint of tetrathiafulvalene ( TTF ) chemistry , TTF and its derivatives can exist in three stable states , which are TTF 0 , TTF °+ , and TTF 2+ . Thus , grafting TTF redox centers on conjugated polymer may lead to a significant increase of their charge storage capacity. 6 Also , the TTF - fused polymers constitute highly polarizable species due to the large number of sulfur atoms in the structure. The extended conjugation could decrease the intramolecular Coulomb repulsive energy between the donor units and thus enhance intramolecular and interstack interactions. 7 Furthermore , the strong propensity of TTFs to selfassemble into regular π-stacks , when covalently attached to a π-conjugated backbone , may be an interesting approach for indirectly controlling the long - range order of the conjugated chain. The incorporation of TTF units into the conjugated polymers would increase the dimensionality of the charge transport , due to improved electron mobility along the polymer backbone via π-conjugation , as well as along the enhanced stacking direction via π-orbital overlap. 8 There have been many reports on the preparation of conjugated polymers with TTF derivatives either in the main chains or in the side chain. 7,9 But for most of the polymers with TTF side chains , it is difficult to achieve the coplanarity of the main chain and the TTF units.",

Four new DPP - based polymers , PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP , were characterized by GPC , TGA , NMR , UV - vis absorption , and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry. The results indicate that their bandgaps as well as their molecular energy levels are readily tuned by copolymerizing with different conjugated electron - donating units. In order to investigate their photovoltaic properties , polymer solar cell ( PSC ) devices based on PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP were fabricated with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymers : PC 70 BM(1 : 2,w / w ) / Ca / Al under the illumination of AM 1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2. The power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) of the four DPP - based PSC devices were measured and shown in this paper. The best performance of the PSC device was obtained by using PDPP - BDP as the electron donor material , and a PCE of 4.45% with an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.72 V , a short - circuit current ( J sc ) of 10.0 mA / cm^2 , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 61.8% was achieved , which is the best result among the DPP - based polymer materials. It is apparent that the PDPP - BDP - based device exhibits a very broad response range , covering from 300 to 850 nm. The results of the solar cells indicate that these types of materials are very promising candidates for highly efficient polymer solar cells . The dramatic growing demand for energy throughout the world has placed great emphasis on the exploration of new sources of energy. Solar energy has attracted much interest , as one of the more promising long - term solutions for clean , renewable energy. Compared to commercial inorganic solar cells , polymer solar cells have been developed quite recently , as conducting polymers themselves were discovered in 1977.^1 Several merits of polymer solar cells such as high mechanical flexibility , low fabrication cost , and availability of homogeneous films at large areas have created much research interest , and great efforts have been made to improve the efficiency. 2 So far , bulk - heterojunction solar cells , which are composed of an interpenetrating network of donors and acceptors , have played a leading role in realizing higher efficiencies. Efficiencies up to 4-5 % have been achieved from poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) as the donor and a soluble fullerene derivative , (6,6)phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) , as the acceptor. 3 However , further improvement of P3HT - based PSC devices is difficult due to P3HT 's intrinsic absorption limit.",

M2 and M4 were synthesized by the reported methods. 4d,9 Compound 8 was synthesized by zinc power reduction reaction on tetraiodobithiophene , compound 7 , at 0 °C in acid conditions. By Stille coupling reaction in toluene using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as catalyst at 110 °C for 18 h , the polymers PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP were obtained with a yield of 40-60 % . All the polymers are soluble in chloroform ( CHCl 3 ) , chlorobenzene , and dichlorobenznene. The weight - average molecular weights ( M w ) of PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) against polystyrene standards in CHCl 3 eluent , and the detailed GPC data are listed in Table 1. The 1H NMR spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure 1. All spectra show signals of the DPP thienoyl protons at about 8.9 ppm and signals of the ethylhexylsubstituted lactam groups of DPP in the region from 0.7 to 1.8 ppm. The signal of the methylene group adjacent to the lactam N atom appears around 4.2 ppm. In all polymers , for every conjugated subunit such as dithienosilole , fluorene , benzo [1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene , and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene , their aromatic protons showed broader resonance peaks ranging from 6.7 to 7.8 ppm due to the polymeric characters.

This indicates that all of them have good thermal stability against oxygen , which is very important in device fabrication process and other kinds of applications. Optical Properties. The photophysical characteristics of the polymers were investigated by ultraviolet - visible ( UV - vis ) absorption spectroscopy in dilute chloroform solutions and as spin - coated films on quartz substrates. Figure 3a shows the absorption spectra of the PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP in chloroform , and the optical data including the absorption peak wavelength ( λ max,abs ) , absorption edge wavelength ( λ edge,abs ) in both solutions and films , and the optical band gap ( E g opt ) are summarized in Table 2.",

All of the polymers have an absorption band located at 300-500 nm , and the second broad absorption band from 500 to 900 nm in long wavelength region should correspond to the π-π* transition of the conjugated polymer main chains. Absorption spectra of these four polymers appear as near - infrared absorption , and the peaks are located at 798 , 649 , 750 , and 727 nm for PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP , respectively. It was found that all four polymers in long wavelength regions exhibited shoulder peaks , which are related not only to the intermolecular aggregation state caused by the strong polarity of the lactam groups of DPP units 7 but also to the increased vibronic coupling associated with molecular rigidity imposed by molecular connectivity in solution measurements. From Figure 3b it can be seen that these four polymers show extended absorption edges in films in the NIR region , which can be attributed to the more aggregated configuration formed in solid state. The absorption edges are listed in Table 2 , corresponding to the optical bandgaps Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the redox behavior of the polymer and to estimate its HOMO and LUMO energy levels. 12 Figure 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP films on a Pt electrode in a 0.1 mol / L Bu 4 NPF 6acetonitrile solution. The results of the electrochemical measurements are listed in Table 3. It can be seen from Figure 4 that there are irreversible n - doping / dedoping ( reduction / reoxidation ) processes in the negative potential range for all the polymers. However , there is reversible p - doping / dedoping ( oxidation / rereduction ) process in the positive potential range for PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP. The onset oxidation potential ( E ox ) is 0.34 V vs Ag / Ag þ for PDPP - DTS , 0.53 V for PDPP-F , 0.46 V for PDPP - BDT , and 0.51 V for PDPP - BDP. Among the four polymers , PDPP - DTS possesses the lowest onset oxidation potential of 0.34 V , indicating that the electron - donating ability of dithienosilole is the strongest among these four electron - donating units. From the electrochemical oxidation doping results we can conclude that the oxidation potentials of the polymers of PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP are proportional to their corresponding electron - donating abilities of dithienosilole , fluorene , benzo [1,2b;3,4-b]dithiophene , and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene , which also coincide with their optical absorption properties.",

From the onset oxidation potentials ( E onset ox ) and the onset reduction potentials ( E onset red ) of the polymers , HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the energy gap of the polymers were calculated according to the equations LUMO = -e(E red þ 4.7 ) ( eV ) and HOMO = -e(E ox þ 4.7 ) ( eV ) , where the units of E ox and E red are V vs Ag / Ag þ . The E LUMO and the E HOMO values of the polymers are included in Table 3. Table 3 shows In order to make a clear comparison , properties of two other DPP - based polymers , PBBTDPP2 and PCBTDPP , have also been listed in Table 3 according to the reported works. 8a,8e The results indicate that the bandgap as well as the molecular energy level of DPP - based polymers can be adjusted by copolymerizing with different electron - donating groups.

Figure 6 shows the I-V curves of the devices , and V oc , J sc , FF , and PCE data were collected and listed in Table 4. It is very clear that the PSC devices based on these four DPPbased polymers exhibit different open - circuit voltages , which are consistent with their HOMO levels. For example , PDPP - DTS exhibits a HOMO level of -5.04 eV , which is the highest value among these four materials ; as a result , the open - circuit voltage obtained by PDPP - DTS was the lowest at only 0.55 V ; accordingly , the highest V oc of these four materials was obtained from PDPP-F , the polymer having the lowest HOMO level. As reported , the photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers are very susceptible to molecular structure.

Therefore , it is hard to reach a solid conclusion by comparison of the parameters , including FF , J sc , and hence PCE , of the devices based on these four DPP - based polymers. It is worthy to mention that another DPP - based polymer , PBBTDPP2 , exhibited some interesting photovoltaic properties in PSC devices. As reported , by using pure dichlorobenzene as solvent during the spin - coating process , the PCE of the device was 2.9% ; however , PCE of the PDPP - BDPbased PSC device can be improved to 4.0% by using a mixed solvent of chloroform and dichlorobenzene. Since the polymer PDPP - BDP exhibited the highest PCE value in these four materials , it was selected to improve photovoltaic properties by using another different treatment during the device fabrication process. In this work , the annealing process in the glovebox was used to improve photovoltaic properties of the PDPP - BDP - based devices. We tried different annealing conditions of the device , and it was found that the best performance was obtained when the device was annealed under 110 °C for 30 min. As shown in Table 4 , after annealing , the J sc and the FF of the device decreased slightly , but the V oc increased from 0.68 to 0.72 V , and as a result , the PCE was improved to 4.45% from 4.31% . This result indicates that annealing is not an effective approach to improve performance of PDPP - BDP - based devices , and further optimizations are in progress. The absorption spectrum of the PDPP - BDP : PC 70 BM blend film prepared under the same conditions as those described in the device fabrication section is shown in Figure 7.

It is apparent that the device exhibits a very broad response range , covering from 300 to 850 nm , but the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the device is within 40% for almost the whole absorption range. The main reason for the low EQE of the device is due to the limited absorbance value of the active layer ; as shown in Figure 7 , it is known that the absorption in the long wavelength region is contributed by the polymer , and the absorption in the short wavelength region is mainly from PC 70 BM ; however , the peak value of the absorbance in the long wavelength region is only ∼ 0.18 , which means that only a small part of sunlight is absorbed in the device.",

Additionally , a ∼ 5% difference between the J sc and the integral of the EQE by the solar irritation spectrum , AM 1.5G , 100 mW , is observed , which provides good proof of the reliability for the photovoltaic results . To improve the high efficiency of polymer solar cells , a soluble chromophore of 3,6-dithiophen-2-yl-2 , 5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) was copolymerized with different electron - rich building blocks such as dithienosilole , fluorene , benzo [1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene , and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene to yield the polymers of PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP.

The effects of the DPP and TID units on the thermal , photophysical and electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis , UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra , and cyclic voltammetry. Compared with the parent polymers ( P1 and P2 ) , the optical properties of the random terpolymers ( P3-P6 ) were controlled successfully by tuning the ratio of DPP and TID. The increase in TID content induced an increased absorption between 450 and 600 nm and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , while higher DPP content resulted in stronger absorption between 600 and 900 nm. Bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the as-synthesized polymers as electron donors and (6,6)-phenyl-Cbutyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) as the acceptor were fabricated. The best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 5.62% was obtained from P5 ( DPP : TID = 1 : 1 ) due to its high short - circuit current density ( J sc higher than 15 mA cm^-2 ) , mainly arising from the broadened light absorption.

As for the random terpolymers ( P3-P6 ) , the relative position and intensity of the absorption peaks were netuned by changing the composition ratio of DPP and TID. By comparing their absorption spectra , a gradual blue - shi was observed when increasing the content of TID , which could be caused to a certain extent by the backbone twist between the main - chain and the side - chain of TID. 16,23 In addition , the increased amount of TID caused the appearance of a new absorption band around 450-600 nm , owing to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) band from BDTT to TID. Meanwhile , the absorption band around 600-900 nm originating from the ICT band from BDTT to DPP gradually decreased with the increasing content of TID. In the solid lms , the absorption maxima of all the polymer lms red - shied in comparison with their solution absorptions , caused to a certain extent by aggregation of the polymer backbones. 24 Additionally , the optical band gaps ( E opt g ) of P1-P6 were estimated to be 1.74 , 1.51 , 1.44 , 1.46^1.26 , and 1.37 eV , respectively , which were determined by the onset of their light absorptions. 25 Comparing to the parent polymers ( P1 and P2 ) , the broad absorptions of the random terpolymers P3-P6 were observed from 300 to 900 nm , indicating that the incorporation of two different electron - decient units into a polymer backbone is an effective method to broaden the absorption band and control the optical band gap . Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the polymers ( Fig. 4 ). The corresponding data are summarized in Table 2.

    "sentence": "On the basis of 4.8 eV below vacuum for the energy level of Fc / Fc + 25 , the HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the electrochemical energy gaps ( E ec g ) of the copolymers were calculated according to the following equations : HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.19 ) ( eV ) LUMO = -e(E red + 4.19 ) ( eV ) E ec g = e(E ox -E red ) ( eV ) The onset potentials for oxidation ( E ox ) were observed to be 0.99 , 1.22 , 1.39 , 1.36 , 1.47 , and 1.04 V for P1-P6 , respectively. The onset potentials for reduction ( E red ) were -0.54 , -0.49 , -0.48 , -0.54 , -0.48 , and -0.48 V for P1-P6 , respectively. Accordingly , the HOMO energy levels of the binary polymers , P1 and P2 , were determined to be -5.18 and -5.41 eV , respectively. And the corresponding values of P3-P6 were tuned by controlling the ratios of DPP to TID , with the data ranging from -5.23 to -5.66 eV. Meanwhile , similar calculations for the LUMO energy levels of all of the copolymers proceeded with the values ranging from -3.65 to -3.71 eV. Given the HOMO and LUMO energy levels , all of the polymers have enough driving force for efficient exciton dissociation with fullerene derivatives. 26 In Table 2 , E ec g was slightly larger than E opt g due to the exciton binding energy of the organic conjugated materials. 10 Film morphology is a key parameter to explain the difference in photovoltaic performance. Therefore , we employed AFM with a tapping - mode to investigate the morphology of the polymer : PC61BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) blend lms. The height images and phase images of the polymers are shown in Fig. 5. It could be observed that the blend lm of P3 and P6 exhibited relatively large phase separation ( Fig. 5a and d ) , which went against the transfer of charge. However , the phase separation of P4 and P5 were improved and relatively homogeneous morphologies were achieved by tuning the ratio of DPP to TID. Compared with P4 , an optimized nanoscale interpenetrating network of P5 and PC61BM was obtained ( Fig. 5c ) , which was benecial for the charge transportation , thus leading to the highest J sc as well as the highest device efficiency ( Table 3 and Fig. 7 ) . The charge carrier transport properties of conjugated polymers play a key role in the performance of PSCs. To understand the inuence of charge carrier mobility of the polymers / PC61BM blend lms on the photovoltaic properties , the hole mobilities of the target polymers were measured by a space charge limit current ( SCLC ) method.",

The average hole mobilities ( m h,ave ) of P1 , P2 , P4 , P5 , P6 ranged from 1.0 x 10^-5 to 2.9 x 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which contributed to the enhanced J sc of 6.58 - 13.71 mA cm^-2 and the ll factor ( FF ) of 0.44 - 0.51 ( Table 3 ). 28 As for P3 , the value was 2.2 x 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which was consistent with the inferior morphology measured by AFM in Fig. 5 , leading to the relatively lower J sc of 2.24 mA cm^-2 . To investigate whether the DPP unit and TID side group make a contribution to the power conversion efficiency in the PSCs , the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs for all of the polymers were fabricated with the ITO / MoO 3 ( 10 nm ) / polymer : PC61BM / LiF(0.5 nm ) / Al(100 nm ) structure. 22,27 More than 10 devices were fabricated and their highest efficiencies and average values are provided in Table 3.

Fig. 6 shows the current density versus voltage ( J-V ) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm^-2 . The photovoltaic parameters , including the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , the ll factor ( FF ) , and the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) , are summarized in Table 3. From Table 3 , the V oc of P1 is 0.71 V , which is comparable to the literature values. 13 P2 exhibited the highest value of 0.94 V , probably caused by the larger backbone twists in the mainchain resulting from the TID side chain and the alkylthienyl substituents on benzodithiophene. 29 It is observed that the V oc of the terpolymers ranges from 0.72 to 0.78 V. The non-linear trend is decided by a couple of other factors besides the HOMO levels of the polymers , such as the bulkiness of the side chains , interchain distances , and morphology of the active layers. 30,31 Furthermore , the PCEs of the random terpolymers showed a non-linear compositional dependence from 0.67 to 5.02% in the order : P5 ( 5.02% ) > P4 ( 4.64% ) > P1 ( 4.05% ) > P6 ( 3.75% ) > P2 ( 2.72% ) > P3 ( 0.67% ).",

    "sentence": "In particular , P5 exhibited the highest PCE value of 5.02% ( J sc = 13.71 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.76 V , FF = 0.48 ) among all of the polymers , which was attributed to the broad absorption and increased V oc due to the deep - lying HOMO energy level. In contrast , the PCE decreased in the device of P3 blended with PC61BM ( 0.67% ) , which mainly results from the signicant decrease of the J sc . Based on the maximum efficiency measured from the device of P5 blended with PC61BM , several optimization processes were taken to improve the PCE. One process involved a mixture of chlorobenzene ( CB ) and chloroform ( CF ) as the processing solvent. The highest PCE of 5.62% ( J sc = 15.13 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.76 V , FF = 0.49 ) was achieved when the volume ratio of CB to CF was 7 : 3.^32 The other process used PC71BM as the electron acceptor. In spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , P5 blended with PC71BM showed a lower PCE value of only 2.49% . In addition , physical blending of P1 and P2 with the weight ratio 1 : 1 was used as a reference with a lower PCE of 3.54% ( J sc = 10.08 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.75 V , FF = 0.46 ). The results demonstrated that developing random terpolymers based on the copolymerization is more effective than physical blending. Meanwhile , PSCs based on the as-synthesized polymers blended with PC61BM were tested for their incident photon - tocurrent conversion efficiencies ( IPCE ). Typical curves are shown in Fig. 7. The IPCE spectra exhibited well - matched curves with their optical absorptions and a close correlation with their photocurrents in the J-V curves. The device based on P1 exhibited two major responses , 300-500 nm and 500-900 nm , with a maximum IPCE of 45% . In comparison with the optical absorption prole of P1 , it is clear that a large proportion of electron charge is generated from the absorption of PCBM. 5 As for P2 , the device only exhibited a response from 300 nm to 650 nm , with a relatively low maximum IPCE of 50% at 447 nm. As shown in Fig. 7 , the IPCE of P3 was extremely low , which corresponds to the bad separation and transport of the photogenerated charges originating from the inferior morphology and the minimum hole mobility. Besides , the IPCEs of P4-P6 in the range 300-900 nm were observed in all devices , suggesting that the photon electron conversion processes were rather effective , which further demonstrated the better performance. Obviously , P5 shows the highest IPCE among them , which is in line with the J sc .",

Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure of polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors have been attracting considerable attention due to their unique advantages of low cost , light weight , and mechanical flexibility. [1][2][3][4][5] The central concern of the studies of PSCs is to increase the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the devices. As we know , the PCE is proportional to the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short circuit current ( J sc ) and fill factor ( FF ) of the PSCs. Therefore , for the conjugated polymer donor materials in the active layer of PSCs , the key issues we should consider in their molecular design are broad absorption spectra to enhance sunlight harvest for higher J sc , appropriately lower HOMO ( the highest occupied molecular orbital ) energy levels to maximize the V oc , and higher hole mobility for higher J sc and higher FF of the PSCs. Donor - acceptor ( D-A ) copolymers have drawn great attentions for the conjugated polymer donor materials in recent years , because of easy tuning of their bandgap , absorption spectra and HOMO energy level by using different donor and acceptor units in the copolymers.

Through a combination of physical measurement , such as optoelectrical characterization , grazing incident wide - angle X-ray diffraction ( GIWAXS ) and pico - second time - resolved photoluminescence , the efficiency enhancement are contributed from comprehensive factors of higher hole mobility , less bimolecular recombination and more efficient slow process of charge separation . Bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted intense attention as the potential photovoltaic technology due to the merits of simple fabrication , low cost , light weight , flexibility and large area mass production.

    "sentence": "Normally , two architectures employed for random terpolymers are D1-A-D2-A by utilizing two donor units for copolymerizing with one acceptor unit and A1-D-A2-D by involving two acceptor and one donor units. For example , in our previous work , replacing 25 mol % of rather expensive 3-fluorothieno [3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate accepting monomer by a 34-times lower - cost bithiophene third donor monomer in the famous D-A conjugated copolymer PTB7-Th , the new terpolymer PTB7-Th-T2 exhibited PCE of 8.19% , which was even slightly higher than 7.89% of the control PTB7-Th at the same device fabrication conditions. 21 By introducing two electron deficient 5,6-difluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole - based monomers and one electron rich benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene containing monomer to form the random terpolymer , the PCE of the polymer / PC71BM BHJ device could be increased from 4.9% ( Th00 ) and 6.9% ( Th100 ) of the two alternative copolymers to 8.0% of the terpolymer Th25. 22 It is noted that only a few random terpolymers have been successfully obtained with PCE values over 8% .

However , other third monomers such as organometal complexes were scarcely demonstrated in random terpolymers for high efficiency BHJ PSCs. The few representatives were limited to Zinc porphyrins derivatives which was incorporated into the D-A conjugated backbone of diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) containing PBT - DPP or difluorobenzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole based PTh4FBT , as well as the cyclometalated heavy metal iridium complex which was linked to PTB7 polymer backbone through ancillary ligand. 20,23,24 In this work , we adopted the terpolymer approach by embedding various low ratio of heavy metal Pt complex to the famous donor polymer of PTB7-Th through the cyclometalated main ligand. By using 1.5 mol % of PyTPAPtacac as the third monomer for random polymerization , the Pt containing PTB7 - ThPt1.5 exhibited the best PCE in polymer / PC71BM blended BHJ devices. At the same device fabrication condition , increased PCE with an average value of 8.25% was obtained for PTB7 - ThPt1.5 compared to 7.81% of PTB7 - Th. Particularly , the molecular weight for PTB7 - ThPt1.5 ( Mn / Mw : 46 / 70 kg / mol ) was obviously lower than the control PTB7-Th ( Mn / Mw : 62 / 97 kg / mol ) , which further indicated the successful terpolymer strategy for the enhancement of PCE on the introduction of extremely low ratio of Pt complexes as the third monomer. Through a combination of optical and electrical investigations , the positive effect could be ascribed to higher hole mobility , less bimolecular recombination and more efficient slow process of charge separation .",

The maximum absorption peaks in the solid film were slightly red - shifted compared with solution. All polymers exhibited similar absorption behavior in the range from 300 to 800 nm. The short wavelength absorption bands ( 300-400 nm ) could be attributed to the π-π* transitions within the aromatic monomer , while the long wavelength absorption bands ( > 500 nm ) were originated from the intramolecular charge - transfer ( ICT ) transitions between the electron donating and accepting segments. As the real content of Pt in terpolymers was even lower than the dBrTPAPyPtacac monomer ratio for polymerization , the absorption features for Pt complex was negligible due to the extremely low content. However , the ~ 300 nm absorption bands which partially assigned to the triphenylamine - centered n-π* transition for polymer PTB7 - ThPt5 exhibited the highest intensity , indicating the highest content of cyclometalated TPA containing Pt complex. Almost identical optical bandgaps ( Eg opt ) of 1.53 - 1.56 eV for all polymers were calculated from the corresponding absorption edge at film state.

    "sentence": "Solution - processed bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) 1 polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have received considerable attention because of their appealing features including low - cost , light - weight , flexibility and good compatibility with the roll - to - roll process for making large area devices. 2 Over the past few years , extensive efforts have been devoted to developing low bandgap polymers consisting of electron donating ( D ) and electron accepting ( A ) unit by utilizing the electron push - pull concept. [3][4] The optical bandgaps , absorption ranges and frontier orbital energy levels have been successfully tuned by varying the electron donors or acceptors. 5 Blends of these conjugated D-A polymers with appropriate electron acceptors have led to PSCs with high power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) . Bandgap , HOMO / LUMO energy and thin film crystallinity are the key metrics of conjugated D-A polymers. Various electron rich-or deficient - conjugated frameworks have been linked and optimized to construct conjugated D-A polymers for high performance PSCs. 4,[6][7][8][9] Recently , conjugated D-A polymers incorporating additional acceptor or donor moieties in the backbones , which are referred to as conjugated donoracceptor terpolymers , have received increasing attentions. [10][11][12] The electron donor - acceptor interactions within the D-A polymers can red - shift the absorptions , but the absorptions in the short wavelength regions , in particular in the visible region , are usually weakened. 13 However , the incorporation of appropriate additional electron acceptor or donor moieties may enable to finely tune and optimize the absorptions. Moreover , by properly choosing co-monomers ( D or A ) and varying the copolymerization molar ratios , HOMO / LUMO energies and thin film morphologies of conjugated polymers can be finely tuned. [10][11][12] For these reasons , conjugated donoracceptor terpolymers are of significant interests as electron donors for high performance PSCs. 12 For instance , Jo and coworkers reported conjugated random terpolymers entailing diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) and isoindigo as co-acceptors ; in comparison with the respective DPP - based and isoindigobased D-A polymers the terpolymers showed strong absorptions and low - lying HOMO levels which led to higher J SC ( short - circuit current ) and V OC ( open - circuit voltage ) for the PSCs. 12a They further prepared the terpolymer with thiophenecapped DPP and pyridine - capped DPP as co-acceptors , and PSCs with PCE up to 8.11% were fabricated with such terpolymer. 12b TBPD shown in Scheme 1 , as a derivative of Pechmann dye 14 with two capped-thiophenes , owns planar and polar structure with bis-amide as electron withdrawing units. Being similar to DPP , TBPD can function as electron acceptor. Some of us investigated both alternating D-A copolymers and small D-A-D molecules with TBPD as the accepting moieties , and both ambipolar and p - type semiconducting behaviors with charge mobilities above 1.0 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 were observed. 15 thiophenes in TBPD with two phenyl groups in order to lower the HOMO energy.",

    "sentence": "Then , we describe the preparation and photovoltaic application of three conjugated random D-A terpolymers PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 ( see Scheme 1 ) , which entail BBPD and dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole ( TDPP ) as coacceptors with different molar ratios , and thiophene as the electron donor. The results reveal that the HOMO energy levels , absorption ranges and thin film morphologies can be tuned by varying the BBPD / TDPP molar ratios. The blend thin film of PBPD1 : PC71BM exhibits better photovoltaic performance with PCE up to 5.21% than the respective ones of PBPD2 and PBPD3 , and the homopolymer PDPP3T as well . Fig. S2 shows the cyclic voltammograms of dibromo-BBPD and dibromo-TBPD , and their absorption spectra in solution. For calibration the redox potential of ferrocene ( Fc ) was measured under the same condition. The respective onset oxidation and reduction potentials of dibromo-BBPD were presented by reference to the redox potential of ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) ( see ( -3.60 eV ). Dibromo-BBPD shows absorptions in the range of 400^-650 nm with a maximum at 563 nm , which is blue - shifted by comparing with that of dibromo-TBPD ( λ max = 615 nm ). In a similar way , the HOMO / LUMO energies of PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 were estimated and listed in Table 1. By comparing with those of PDPP3T , the HOMO energies of these 18a-18c D-A terpolymers were lowered , while their LUMO energies increased slightly by increasing the content of BBPD in the backbones ( see Fig. 1 ). For instance , the HOMO / LUMO energies of PBPD3 were estimated to be -5.24 eV and -3.63 eV , respectively. Conjugated D-A polymers with low HOMO levels are expected to increase V OC of the PSCs. 18 But , bandgaps of PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 based on the cyclic voltammetric data are larger than that of PDPP3T and increase in the following order : PBPD1 ( 1.53 eV ) < PBPD2 ( 1.56 eV ) < PBPD3 ( 1.61 eV ). Thus , it is necessary to adjust the content of BBPD in the backbone to afford D-A terpolymers with wide absorptions and appropriate HOMO / LUMO levels simultaneously. It is noted that the HOMO levels of these terpolymers are slightly changed when increasing the content of BBPD. This is consistent with the DFT calculations with the following repeated units : thiophene-TDPP-thiophene-TDPP ( M1 ) , thiophene-BBPD-thiophene-TDPP ( M2 ) , thiophene-BBPDthiophene-BBPD ( M3 ) in Fig. 2 as discussed below. The alteration of HOMO / LUMO levels for PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 in comparison with PDPP3T is in good agreement with the density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations ( see Fig. 2 and Supporting Information ). DFT calculations at the B3LYP / 6-31G ( d ) level were performed for the corresponding repeating units.",

HOMO / LUMO energies of M1 , M2 , M3 were calculated to be -4.58 / -2.74 eV , -4.63 / -2.71 eV and -4.65 / -2.68 eV , respectively. Although discrepancies exist between the calculated HOMO / LUMO energies and those determined based on the respective cyclic voltammetric data , the calculation results also indicate that the incorporation of BBPD lowers the HOMO level and increases the LUMO level. It should be noted both HOMO and L U M O orbitals of M1 , M2 and M3 are well distributed over their conjugated backbones ( see Fig. 2 ) , which are beneficial for charge carrier transporting. 19 Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of the solutions and thin films of all the polymers. Solutions of PBPD1 , PBPD2 , P B P D 3 and PDPP3T exhibit strong absorptions at 722 nm ( ε max = 48000 M -1 cm^-1 ) , 686 nm ( ε max = 33000 M -1 cm^-1 ) , 650 nm ( ε max = 28000 M -1 cm^-1 ) and 808 nm ( ε max = 56000 M -1 cm^-1 ) , respectively ( Table 1 ). In comparison , absorptions of thin films of PBPD1 , PBPD2 , PBPD3 and PDPP3T are red - shifted compared to the respective maxima absorptions of their solutions , which may be owing to the π-π interactions between the conjugated polymer chains according to previous studies. 20 It is obvious to note that the absorptions of both solutions and thin films of PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 are blueshifted compared to PDPP3T ; as the ratio of BBPD unit increases , the degree of blue - shift increases. As shown in Fig. S3A and the absorptions can be broadened by introducing appropriate amounts of BPD in the DPP polymers. PDPP3T exhibits a strong absorption at 808 nm and a shoulder peak at 748 nm in solution , whereas thin film of PDPP3T show absorptions at 834 nm and 770 nm. Similarly , the solution of PBPD1 absorbs strongly at 722 nm and two absorptions at 808 nm and 754 nm are detected for its thin film. Thus , the absorptions around 834 nm and 808 nm for thin films of PDPP3T and PBPD1 may be ascribed to the respective interchain interactions. Compared to PDPP3T and PBPD1 , the thin film absorptions of PBPD2 and PBPD3 are blue - shifted. As discussed below , thin morphologies of PBPD2 and PBPD3 are obviously different from those of PDPP3T and PBPD1 , indicating the interchain interactions for thin films of PBPD2 and PBPD3 are likely different from those of PDPP3T and PBPD1.",

The respective blends of PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 with PC71BM at weight ratios of 1 : 2 gave the best photovoltaic performances. As listed in Table 2 , the open circuit voltages ( V OC ) of PSCs with PBPD1 : PC71BM , PBPD2 : PC71BM and PBPD3 : PC71BM are higher than that with PDPP3T:PC71BM. This can be explained by considering the fact that HOMO energies of PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 are lower than that of PDPP3T , and they decrease in the following order : PBPD1 > PBPD2 > PBPD3 ( see Table 1 ). But , J sc and FF are relatively small for PSCs with these blending thin films and as a result PCEs are not significantly high. Among the blending thin films PBPD1 : PC71BM yields the highest PCE up to 5.21% . This is in agreement with the IPCE spectra shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 6 depicts the two dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction ( 2D GIXRD ) patterns for these blends. Only one diffraction arc along the q z direction , corresponding to ( 100 ) diffraction , at q z = ~ 0.34 Å -1 ( corresponding a d-spacing of 18.4 Å ) , was detected for all the blending thin films. In comparison , relatively strong ( 100 ) diffraction was observed for PBPD1 : PC71BM as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S4. No diffractions for interchain π-π stacking were detected for all blending thin films. The differences in surface morphology and packing order degree may explain the observation that PBPD1 : PC71BM shows higher IPCE than PDPP3T:PC71BM , although the difference between the absorptions of PBPD1 and PDPP3T is small. To conclude , these AFM images , TEM images and 2D GIXRD data agree well with the observation that PBPD1 : PC71BM shows relatively good photovoltaic performance , while other blends exhibit low power conversion efficiencies .",

Various acceptors were introduced into the selenophene backbones , and the solubility , absorption spectra , energy levels , charge transport , blend film morphology , and photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers were investigated. The weight - averaged molecular weights ( M w ) of Organic solar cells based on conjugated polymers have the potential to be applied as a clean energy source. In addition , such cells have the advantages that they can be fabricated at low cost via solution - based processing and that they have mechanical flexibility appropriate for foldable or rollable substrates. 1-4 Bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) devicesin which a donor polymer ( p - type ) is blended with a fullerene derivative or other acceptor ( n - type ) materialhave emerged as the most efficient polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) developed to date. 5-7 One of the main factors limiting the performance of PSCs is the mismatch between their absorption and the terrestrial solar spectra. Polymer materials with low bandgaps are therefore needed to harvest solar photons at longer wavelengths , particularly in the near-IR region , and with a broader spectrum. Conjugated polymers that incorporate alternating donor and acceptor units produce significant decreases in the bandgap , due to the introduction of intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) structures. 8-10 Several types of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) conjugated copolymers have been synthesized for use in highperformance organic photovoltaic ( OPV ) applications. The use of thiophene as a donating moiety and quinoxaline ( Qx ) and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) as accepting moieties has been closely investigated and provides a successful strategy to achieve low - bandgap materials. 11,12 Compared with their thiophene analogues , selenophene - containing polymers have been studied to a lesser extent , possibly due to the difficulties associated with their synthesis. As a class , polyselenophenes are expected to have advantages over polythiophenes. For example , interchain charge transfer should be facilitated by the intermolecular Se- Se contact , which means that polyselenophenes should have higher bulk conductivities and mobilities than polythiophenes. 13 Furthermore , selenophene substitution in conjugated polymers reduces the bandgap energy , mainly by stabilizing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) level more effectively than the corresponding polythiophenes. 14-16 Poly(3hexylselenophene) ( P3HS ) displays a bandgap energy ( 1.6 eV ) lower than that of P3HT ( 1.9 eV ). 15 The photovoltaic properties of P3HS : PCBM devices result in a high power conversion efficiency ( 2.7% ) because P3HS provides a more extensive photon absorption cross section than P3HT. 14 Poly(3,3-dialkylterselenophene) ( PSSS ) also exhibits high charge - carrier mobilities and ambipolar behaviors in organic field effect transistor devices ; the low LUMO energy levels are thought to facilitate both electron injection and transport.",

    "sentence": "16 Recently , several groups have reported the use of selenophene- based D-A copolymers ( with a selenophene donor and various acceptors ) for organic transistors , but the solar cell performances of these polymers have not yet been reported. 17,18 Here , we report the synthesis , optical and physical properties , and OPV performances of novel selenophene - based D-A lowbandgap polymers. These polymers were synthesized using a Stille cross-coupling reaction , with terselenophene as a donor and quinoxaline ( Qx ) and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) as acceptors. The Qx - containing polymers are denoted as P3SDTQ , and those containing DPP are denoted as P3SDTDPP. These polymers have lower bandgaps in πconjugated polymers , thereby increasing the overall photon absorption by extending the spectral sensitivity. We examined the effects of the incorporation of different acceptors in the selenophene backbones on the absorption , energy levels , charge transport properties , morphologies , and photovoltaic properties of the donor / acceptor blends. In addition , terthiophene - based D-A polymers ( with terthiophene as a donor and quinoxaline ( Qx ) ( P3TDTQ ) and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) ( P3TDTDPP ) as acceptors ) were also synthesized using the same polymerization method , to allow a comparison between the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of the terthiophene - based D-A polymers and those of the selenophene - based polymers . . The weight - average molecular weights ( M w ) of P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP were determined using gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , using a polystyrene standard in a chloroform eluent ; they were found to be 12^300 ( PDI = 1.46 ) , 15^500 ( PDI = 1.85 ) , 13^300 ( PDI = 1.58 ) , and 17^200 ( PDI = 1.63 ) , respectively. The polymer readily dissolved in common organic solvents such as toluene , chloroform , and THF and formed good films. Thermal analysis of the polymers was conducted using differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure 1. The results showed that both polymers had good thermal stability over 300 °C , and no obvious thermal transitions were observed between 50 and 200 °C . The polymerization results for the synthesized copolymers are summarized in Table 1. Optical and Electrochemical Properties. The UV - vis absorption spectra of the copolymers are shown in Figure 2 for copolymers in a dilute chlorobenzene solution and in thin films ; the absorption data for the polymers are summarized in Table 2.",

    "sentence": "The λ max of P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP in solution occurred at 549 , 599 , 679 , and 702 nm , respectively , whereas those in the thin films occurred at 587 , 619 , 716 , and 753 nm , respectively ; these values were significantly red - shifted compared with those of poly(3,3dialkylterthiophene) ( PTT , λ max,film = 510 nm ) and poly(3,3dialkylterselenophene) ( PSSS , λ max,film = 614 nm ). 16,21 The UV - vis absorption spectra of the P3S - based polymers ( P3SDTQ and P3SDTDPP ) were red - shifted by about 20- 50 nm with respect to those of the P3T - based polymers ( P3TDTQ and P3TDTDPP ) , both in solution and in thin films ; this resulted from the presence of selenium atoms in the polymer repeat units. Selenium atoms are more electron - rich than sulfur atoms ; hence , aromatic rings containing selenium are more easily delocalized than those containing sulfur atoms. 15,22,23 Moreover , the absorption spectra of the DPPcontaining polymers ( P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP ) were redshifted by over 130 nm compared with the spectra of the Qxcontaining polymers ( P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ ) , suggesting the presence of stronger π-π interchain associations and aggregation in the solid state. Such aggregation is beneficial for improving charge mobility in thin films. The optical bandgaps of the polymer thin films were determined from the UV - vis absorption onsets in the solid state ( E g = 1240 / λ onset eV ). The optical bandgaps ( E g ) in the thin films were 1.70 , 1.63 , 1.27 , and 1.25 eV for P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP , respectively ; these values were significantly lower than those found for poly(3,3-dialkylterthioophene) ( PTT , 2.1 eV ) and poly(3,3-dialkylterselenophene) ( PSSS , 1.8 eV ). This successful reduction in the bandgap was mainly due to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) effects between the terthiophene donor or terselenophene donors and the Qx or DPP acceptor groups. The DPP moiety was a stronger acceptor than Qx , which led to a smaller E g for P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP than for P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ. The low bandgaps of P3TDTDPP ( 1.27 eV ) and P3SDTDPP ( 1.25 eV ) may have resulted from the planarity and high degree of conjugation in the DPP acceptor , which would enhance the π-π interactions and ICT among the polymer main chains. 24-26 Moreover , the optical bandgaps of the P3S - based polymer thin films were smaller than those of the P3T - based polymers because of the electron - rich selenium atoms in the core repeat units. The significant broadening in the absorption spectra of P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP ( relative to P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ ) may have indicated better ordering of the molecules in the bulk phase , which was manifested in the behavior of the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ).",

These measurements were performed in an electrolyte solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate ( TBABF 4 ) in anhydrous acetonitrile , at room temperature and under nitrogen , with a scan rate of 50 mV / s. The HOMO levels of the polymer films were estimated from the cyclic voltammograms , using the equation E HOMO = -(E ox + 4.8 ) eV , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential relative to the ferrocene standard material. 27 The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy levels of P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP were calculated to be -5.37 , -5.35 , -5.21 , and -5.16 eV , respectively , using the ferrocene reference value of -4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The LUMO levels of P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP were calculated to be -3.67 , -3.72 , -3.94 , and -3.91 eV , respectively , as estimated from the optical bandgaps and HOMO energy levels. The deep HOMO levels may have contributed to the improved oxidative stability and higher open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) compared with those of PTT ( -5.2 eV ) and PSSS ( -4.9 eV ). 16 The above results indicated that the bandgap and molecular energy levels of P3T-or P3S - based polymers could be efficiently tuned by incorporating appropriate electron - withdrawing Qx and DPP groups. The electrochemical potentials are summarized in Table 2. Field - Effect Transistor Characteristics. The effects of the shape and position of the side chains on the electrical transport properties of the resulting polymers were examined by measuring the field - effect transistor ( FET ) mobility. The field - effect carrier mobilities of the polymers were investigated by fabricating thin - film transistors with a bottom - contact geometry , using Au electrodes.

    "sentence": "The hole mobility values for the P3S - based polymers were ∼ 1.5 times higher than those for the P3T - based polymers. The hole mobilities of the DPP - containing polymers ( P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP ) were 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of the Qx - containing polymers ( P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ ). The higher mobilities measured for P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP can be understood in terms of an improved intermolecular π-π stacking , which corresponds well with the UV - vis results. In addition , P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP yielded higher hole mobilities than P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ ; this was attributed to the more efficient charge extraction in the P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP solar cell devices ( Table 3 ). Organic Photovoltaic Characteristics. Polymer solar cell devices were fabricated using the P3T-and P3S - based polymers as electron donors and [6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) as an electron acceptor. The device structure was ITO / PEDOT : PSS(50 nm ) / polymer : PC61BM / LiF(0.6 nm ) / Al(130 nm ). The photovoltaic performances of the polymer : PC61BM devices are summarized in Table 3 and Figure 4. The PCEs varied considerably with the polymer : PCBM blend ratio used in the devices ; the details of the variation depended on the polymer backbone. Thus , the PCE of the Qx - containing polymer devices was higher for a blend ratio of 1 : 3 than 1 : 1 , while for DPP - containing polymer devices , the PCE was better with a 1 : 1 blend ratio than with a ratio of 1 : 3. The PCEs of the P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP devices were found to be 0.30% , 0.52% , 1.88% , and 1.85% , respectively.

The high V OC values for the P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ devices could be explained by the low HOMO energy levels of P3TDTQ ( -5.37 eV ) and P3SDTQ ( -5.35 eV ) compared with those of P3TDTDPP ( -5.21 eV ) and P3SDTDPP ( -5.16 eV ). Among the devices using the P3T-and P3S - based polymers , the P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP devices demonstrated better photovoltaic performances than did those using P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ because the photon absorption fraction and the FET mobility were higher in the DPP - containing polymer films than in those containing Qx. The DPP - containing polymer devices therefore exhibited a high short circuit current density ( J SC ).",

The PCEs of the P3T-and P3S - based devices were heavily dependent on the electron - withdrawing accepting units. Interestingly , regardless of the PCE values of the devices , the P3S - based devices ( Qx and DPP ) always showed higher J SC values than the corresponding thiophene analogues ( for the same PCBM blend ratio ). The increased short circuit currents of the P3S - based devices could be attributed to the increased spectral breadth of the absorbed photons and hole mobilities. To better understand the origin of the differences in the photovoltaic performances of the polymer solar cells , AFM images of the surface morphologies of each solar cell device were collected ( Figure S2 , Supporting Information ). Generally , nanoscale phase separation should be established to allow efficient charge separation ; this is true due to the short exciton diffusion length ( ∼ 10 μm ) of the donor polymers. 29 As can be seen in Figure S2 , the P3TDTDPP : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) and P3SDTDPP : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) films showed a smoother and more interconnected network of polymer - PCBM domains , which accounted for the high photocurrent density in these films. In contrast , relatively high levels of aggregation were observed in the P3TDTQ : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) and P3SDTQ : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) films , which reduced the area for charge separation , leading to a low photocurrent. There were no significant differences between the morphologies of the P3T - based films and those of the P3S - based films. The performances of the solar cells based on P3TDTDPP : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) and P3SDTDPP : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) films were further enhanced via the use of [6,6]-phenyl C 71butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as an electron acceptor and the use of a mixed chlorobenzene ( CB ) / 1,8-diiodoctane ( DIO ) ( 97% : 3% by volume ) solvent.

    "sentence": "Bandgap and molecular energy level control are of great importance in improving photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers. A common approach to tuning these parameters is to modify the structure of conjugated polymers by copolymerizing with different units. In this paper , research work focuses on the synthesis of benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) with different conjugated units and their photovoltaic performance. Eight new BDT - based polymers with commonly used conjugated units , including thiophene , benzo [c][1,2,5]thiadiazole ( BT ) , thieno [3,4-b]pyrazine ( TPZ ) , etc. , were synthesized. The bandgaps of the polymers were tuned in the range of 1.0 - 2.0 eV , and their HOMO and LUMO energy levels could also be tuned effectively. The absorption spectra as well as electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these polymers were investigated systematically. Some units exhibiting the same effect of bandgap lowering exhibited different effects on molecular energy levels of the polymers. For example , the TPZ unit can reduce the bandgap by lowering the LUMO energy level and elevating the HOMO level of the polymer , but the BT unit can lower the bandgap only by depressing the LUMO level. Since open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the heterojunction polymer solar cell is believed to be inversely proportional to the HOMO level of electron donor material , V oc of the devices based on H9 , the copolymer of BDT and TPZ , was ca. 0.5 V lower than that of the device based on H7 , the copolymer of BDT and BT. The effects of seven commonly used units on bandgap , molecular energy level , and photovoltaic properties of the BDT based polymers are studied and discussed in this paper , which can provide a guideline not only for design of photovoltaic materials but also for materials of various other electronic devices. In addition , the PCE of the device based on PCBM and H6 , one of the BDT - based polymers , reached 1.6% , and V oc , I sc , and FF of the device were 0.75 V , 3.8 mA / cm^2 , and 56% , respectively , which indicates that BDT is a promising common unit for photovoltaic conjugated polymers. Since we have developed the synthetic method of the 4,8-bisalkoxy-BDT monomer , the BDT unit will play an important role in future research on conjugated polymer design . Conjugated polymers have attracted considerable attention due to their versatile applications in the fields of conducting polymers and conjugated polymer optoelectronic devices. As optoelectronic materials , conjugated polymers are broadly used in polymer light - emitting diodes ( PLEDs ) , 1 polymer field effect transistors ( PFETs ) , 2 sensors , 3 photodetectors , 4 polymer photovoltaic cells ( PPVCs ) or polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , etc. 5 In order to get efficient electronic devices , it is necessary to tune their properties , such as band gap , molecular energy level , solubility , luminescence , absorbance and so on.",

    "sentence": "6 For conjugated polymers used in PSC devices , bandgap and molecular energy levels are of crucial importance for device performance. The mismatch between absorption spectra of conjugated polymers and the solar irradiance spectrum is one of the main reasons for low efficiency of PSC devices. As shown in Figure 1 , the spectrum of photon flux of sunlight exhibits a broadband in the range from 350 to 3000 nm with a peak at about 680 nm. However , the active layer of PSC devices can absorb only a small portion of sunlight. In fact , the absorption spectrum of poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , a widely used photovoltaic material , only covers the range of 300-650 nm. 7 In order to improve light harvesting by PSCs , some small - bandgap polymers were introduced into PSCs. 8 For example , poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′] dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) ] ( PCPDTBT ) provides a better overlap with the solar spectrum than P3HT and was successfully used in application of PSC. 9 However , the molecular energy levels of the materials were not ideal yet , in that a great deal of energy of absorbed photons was lost during the photon - electron conversion process , which is another important reason for low efficiency of PSC devices. As shown in Figure 1 , the energy of photons absorbed by active layer materials is more than 1.5 eV , but V oc of the devices is only around 0.6 V. For PCPDTBTbased solar cells , more than 60% of the energy of absorbed photons is lost during the photon - electron conversion process ; for P3HT - based solar cells , this kind of energy loss can get to more than 75% . As reported , V oc of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell varies directly with the gap between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit ( LUMO ) level of electron acceptor material and the highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) level of electron donor material. 10 Therefore , to pursue higher V oc , the electron donor material with a deeper HOMO level or electron acceptor material with a higher LUMO level should be employed in polymer solar cells. HOMO and LUMO energy levels of conjugated polymers as well as their bandgaps are tunable by copolymerizing with different units. For example , the bandgap of poly(3-alkylthiophene) can be lowered from 1.85 to 1.55 eV after substituting with alkoxy groups at the 3-position. Correspondingly its HOMO level is elevated from -4.75 to -4.47 eV as a result of which V oc of the PSC devices dropped from 0.6 V ( for poly(3alkylthiophene - based device ) to 0.02 V ( for poly(3-alkoxythiophene) - based device ). 11 The polymer of 4,4-dioctylcyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene exhibited a bandgap of 1.8 eV and a HOMO level of -5.15 eV , 12 and after being copolymerized with 4,7-diylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole , the band gap of the polymer was lowered to 1.4 eV , but its HOMO level had little change.",

These results reveal that it is necessary to investigate effects of copolymerized functional units on bandgap and molecular energy levels of conjugated polymers. In this paper , effects of seven different but commonly used units on bandgap and molecular energy levels of conjugated polymers were investigated systematically , and these results provide some useful reference to control bandgap and molecular energy levels of conjugated polymers. Additionally , a family of conjugated polymer photovoltaic materials was designed , synthesized , and characterized systematically. Furthermore , the photovoltaic properties of the new polymers were also investigated by fabricating the PSC devices . All of these BDT - based polymers exhibited very similar thermal stability , and Figure 2 shows the thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) plots of H6 and H7 as representative samples. The onset decomposition temperatures of the polymers are around 270 °C without protection of inert gas , due to leaving of alkoxy groups. Obviously , the thermal stability of the BDTbased polymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices .

In films , the peak of absorption spectrum of the homopolymer of BDT , H2 , is at about 495 nm. In comparison with H2 , absorption spectra of H3 and H6 show a red shift by 10 nm , and the absorption spectrum of the polymer H8 shifts to the red direction by about 40 nm because of the strong electron - donating effect of EDOT. However , the four electron - deficient units exhibit a strong effect in lowering the bandgap of the BDT - based polymers.

In order to reveal the relationship between HOMO level of electron donor material and V oc of the device , the variation of V oc of the devices based on BDT polymers as a function of HOMO level is shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that , in general , V oc of the devices varies inversely with HOMO level of the electron donor material. As listed in Table 1 , the onset points of oxidation and reduction of H2 are 0.44 V ( E ox ) and -2.05 V ( E red ) , corresponding to a HOMO level of -5.16 eV and a LUMO level of -2.67 eV. Polymer H8 has a similar E red potential as H6 , but E ox of H8 is 0.49 V higher than that of H6 , which is due to the strong electron - pushing effect of the 3,4ethylenedioxythiophene units. As a result , V oc of H6 - based device was 0.38 V higher than the H8 - based device , which indicates that insertion of electron - donating functional groups for lowering bandgap is not a feasible method in terms of photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers. The four electron - deficient units also exhibited different effects on molecular energy levels of the BDT - based polymers. E g of the polymer H9 reached 1.05 eV , which is the smallest among these polymers , and its absorption spectrum matched the spectrum of solar irradiation very well. However , V oc of the H9 - based device is only 0.21 V because the HOMO level of H9 is too high. The BT unit has little influence on the HOMO level of the BDT - based polymer , and the HOMO of H7 is similar to that of H2. The LUMO level of H7 is lower than H2 by about 0.52 eV , which indicates that the BT unit can the lower bandgap by depressing the LUMO level only. As a result , V oc of H7based devices was 0.68 V , which is much higher than that of H9. The BSe unit , the analogue of BT , exhibited more effect on depressing the LUMO level of BDT - based polymer , but it also exhibited a small effect on elevating the HOMO level. The LUMO level of H11 is higher than H7 by 0.12 eV , and the LUMO level of H11 is lower than H7 by 0.14 eV.

We are working on investigating the relationship between morphology of active layers and performance of the BDT polymer - based devices and will report in the near future. Since the polymer H9 exhibits a broad absorption spectrum extending to 1000 nm , we measured the input photon to converted current efficiency ( IPCE ) curve to investigate the response range of the material. As shown in Figure 7 , the shape of the IPCE curve of the device based on H9 is very similar to its absorption spectrum , indicating that all the absorption of the polymer contributed to the photovoltaic conversion . In this paper , eight BDT - based conjugated polymers ( see Scheme 1 ) were designed and synthesized , and seven commonly used aromatic units were used to tailor the bandgap of the polymers as well as molecular energy levels. By copolymerizing with different units , bandgaps and molecular energy levels of the polymers can be tuned effectively. The effects of these units on bandgaps and molecular energy levels were investigated systematically by absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltam - metry methods. The PSC devices based on the polymers were fabricated and characterized. We found that the V oc of the devices varied inversely with the HOMO level of the electron donor materials , and some units such as ethylenedioxythiophene and TPZ can not be used as bandgap - lowering units in BDT polymers due to the fact that HOMO levels of the polymers were elevated too much after being copolymerized with these units. However , the BT unit can lower the bandgap by reducing the LUMO level only , and the BSe unit exhibits similar properties as BT. So , for optimization of bandgaps and molecular energy levels of BDT - based polymers , BT and BSe are preferable to TPZ and BPQ. These results provide some good reference to bandgap and molecular energy level control of BDT - based polymers and should also be useful for molecular structure design of other kinds of conjugated polymers serving in various electronic devices. Although photovoltaic performance of the devices based on the new materials was lower than the device based on classic materials such as P3HT , the device based on H6 : PCBM exhibited promising photovoltaic properties without any posttreatment.

    "sentence": "The typical current density versus voltage ( J-V ) characteristic curves and corresponding external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra for the solar cells are shown in Figure 2a,b. The photovoltaic data are listed in Table 2 and Table S1. For HFAQx-T:PC71BM solar cells , the best devices gave a PCE of 9.2% , with a V oc of 0.90 V , a J sc of 14.0 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 0.74. These devices have a D / A ratio of 1 : 1.2 ( w / w ) , an active layer thickness of 95 nm , and 0.25% DIO ( v / v ) as the additive ( see Table S1 ). The PCE of 9.2% is the highest efficiency reported in the literature to date for Qx - based polymer / fullerene OSCs , which might be due to the good light - harvesting capability of HFAQx-T and the ideal phase separation in the active layer. DIO was found very crucial in improving the performance of HFAQx-T:PC71BM devices. The devices without DIO gave a poor PCE of 3.5% , with reduced J sc and FF of 8.9 mA cm^-2 and 0.43 , respectively. After adding 0.25% ( v / v ) DIO , the EQE maximum increased from 49.9% to 74.2% at 500 nm , accounting for the enhancement of J sc . Highly efficient photovoltaic performance is achieved when ITIC is used as acceptor material. For these fullerene - free based OSCs , the as-cast device of HFAQx - T : ITIC ( 0.8 : 1.0 , w / w ) exhibited a PCE of 8.8% , while it was distinctly enhanced to 9.6% efficiency after annealing at 130 °C for 10 min , with a V oc of 0.94 V , a J sc of 15.4 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 0.66. Compared to the as-cast devices , the increased PCE of the devices with thermal annealing treatment is largely a result of the increased J sc and FF. Furthermore , compared with PC71BM devices , ITIC based devices gave a higher V oc and J sc , which is due to the enlarged energy gap between donor 's HOMO and acceptor 's LUMO and the increased absorption in the NIR region , respectively. According to the EQE curves , the calculated J sc values of the devices agree well with J sc from J-V measurements within 5% mismatch , indicating that our photovoltaic results are reliable. The series resistance ( R s ) and shunt resistance ( R sh ) of OSCs are measured to elucidate the effects of additive and thermal annealing from their respective J-V curves under illumination. As shown in Table 2 , the optimized fullerene - and fullerene - free based devices present a relatively lower R s and higher R sh in comparison to their corresponding as-cast devices , suggesting better overall diode characteristics after the optimization process.",

    "sentence": "To better understand the effect of DIO treatment or thermal annealing on the photovoltaic performance of the HFAQx - T : acceptor blend films , the hole and electron mobilities ( μ h and μ e ) were evaluated by the space limited current ( SCLC ) method 52 with the hole - only device structure , ITO / PE - DOT : PSS / HFAQx - T : acceptor / Au and electron - only device structure ITO / ZnO / HFAQx - T : acceptor / ZrAcac or PDINO / Al. Figure S7 shows the J 1 / 2 -V plots of the HFAQx - T : acceptorbased devices with or without DIO treatment and thermal annealing ; the related mobility data are listed in Table S2. For the as-cast film of HFAQx-T:PC71BM , the μ h and μ e are caculated to be 6.46 × 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and 1.10 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , with μ h / μ e ratio of 0.06. While after DIO treatment , μ h and μ e values were increased to 7.62 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and 1.63 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , with the better ratio of 0.47. The higher and more balanced charge carrier mobilities will reduce recombination and built up space charge density , which contribute to high FF and better photovoltaic performance of the devices based on HFAQx-T:PC71BM. For HFAQx - T : ITIC blend films , the μ h and μ e values are 2.87 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and 1.60 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , with the μ h / μ e ratio of 0.12 for the film without thermal annealing , while after thermal annealing , μ h and μ e values were increased to 8.63 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and 2.10 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , with the better ratio of 0.41 , which could be responsible for the improvement of its photovoltaic performance of the devices based on HFAQx - T : ITIC with thermal annealing. To further investigate the effects of the 4-alkyl-3,5difluorophenyl side chain on the device performance , here , we measured the photocurrent versus light intensity ( P light ) curves to study the charge recombination behavior of the HFAQx - T : acceptor in the devices ( see Figure 2c ). In general , the relationship between J sc and P light could be expressed as J sc ∝ P light a , where the power - law component ( a ) value approaches unity when bimolecular recombination of charge carriers is negligible. 53 The values of α for the HFAQx-T:PC71BM ( 1 : 1.2 , w / w ) and HFAQx - T : ITIC ( 0.8 : 1.0 , w / w ) as-cast devices are 0.94 and 0.98 , respectively , indicates the existence of the bimolecular recombination.",

    "sentence": "However , good α values of 0.97 and 0.99 were obtained for optimized fullerene - and fullerene - freebased devices ; the results showed that bimolecular recombination was more suppressed after optimization and should make a great contribution to the enhanced FF and J sc . Moreover , we investigated the process of exciton generation , exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency of the BHJ OSCs by measuring the photocurrent density ( J ph ) versus the effective voltage ( V eff ) curves. V eff can be described as V eff = V 0 - V bias , where V 0 is the voltage when J ph = 0 and V bias is the applied external voltage bias. J ph can be described as J ph = J L - J D , where J L and J D are the current densities under illumination and in the dark , respectively. Figure 2d shows a log - log plot of J ph versus V eff for HFAQx - T : acceptor blend films. As shown in Figure 2d , J ph reaches saturation ( J sat ) at V eff ≥ 2 V , indicating that almost all of the photogenerated free carriers in the devices can be collected by electrodes. The charge collection probability at short - circuit condition can be calculated from J ph / J sat . The J ph / J sat value for the optimized devices of HFAQx-T:PC71BM and HFAQx - T : ITIC is 92.4% and 90.0% , respectively , implying that both optimized fullerene - and fullerene - free OSCs based on HFAQx-T have highly efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection. Morphology Investigation. The morphology of the active layer has a significant influence on photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Here , we studied the morphologies of the blend films by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Figure 3a-d ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( Figure 3e-h ). For the HFAQx-T:PC71BM blend film , the AFM image exhibits a relatively serious self - aggregation with a large root-mean-square ( RMS ) value of 5.12 nm which would limit the probability for exciton dissociation and suffer serious trap - assisted recombination consistent with the charge separation and recombination studies ( Figure 3a ). The corresponding TEM image shows high phase separation and severe aggregation ( Figure 3e ) , which may be attributed to the poor miscibility of HFAQx-T with PC71BM. However , a smooth surface morphology was observed ( RMS = 1.57 nm ) after optimizing by 0.25 vol % DIO additive treatment ( Figure 3b ) , which would be favorable to get more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport for OSCs , and thus higher FF and PCE can be achieved , while HFAQx - T : ITIC film with thermal annealing became rougher , with RMS roughness increasing from 0.97 to 1.04 nm ( Figure 3c,d ) , indicating that slightly enhanced aggregation which would be benefit the charge transport.",

    "sentence": "HFAQx-T showed good solubility in common organic solvents , a broad absorption from 300 to 700 nm , and a low - lying HOMO energy level of -5.50 eV. The optimized conventional singlejunction device of HFAQx-T:PC71BM achieved a PCE of 9.2% , with a V oc of 0.9 V , a J sc of 14.0 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 0.74 , which is the highest efficiency reported in the literatures to date for BDT-Qx based fullerene OSCs. When blended with ITIC , the HFAQx-T based device showed a PCE of 9.6% , attributing to the more complementary absorption and better energy level match of the HFAQx-T and ITIC. HFAQx-T is among a few D-A copolymers that can deliver > 9% efficiency in both fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells , which is inspiring for the design of new donors compatible with fullerene and fullerene - free acceptors. The results indicated that incorporation of two weak electrondonating alkyl side chain onto the 4-positions of the phenyl at the Qx unit by side - chain engineering would be a feasible approach to improve photovoltaic properties. Through further efforts on modifying the chemical structure of HFAQx-T , device optimization and selection of matched acceptor , higher PCE can be anticipated .",
