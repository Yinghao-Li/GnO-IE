    "sentence": "We present controls of nanomorphology of polymer : fullerene BHJ films via synthesis of a series of push - pull - type copolymers with various molar percentages of side chains terminated with o-dichlorobenzyl ( DCBZ ) groups. As the molar percentage of the DCBZ-containing repeat units increases , the miscibility of the polymers in the series with PC71BM increases with respect to that of the polymer ( PTBBO ) that does not contain DCBZ. In the optimal film morphology , which consists of a polymer containing 25 mol % DCBZ-terminated side chains in the electron - pull unit ( PTBDCB25 ) , the polymer / PC71BM interface area is sufficiently large for efficient charge separation and percolated pathways is present for efficient charge carrier transport. In contrast , the BHJ film prepared from PTBBO has smaller interfaces and larger PC71BM aggregates. Furthermore , the intermolecular interaction between PC71BM and DCBZ induced changes in the PC71BM 's electronic structure at the polymer : PC71BM interface , resulting in an increase of the PC71BM 's LUMO level and thereby the improved open - circuit voltage. As a result , the BHJ solar cell device fabricated with PTBDCB25 exhibits significantly improved performance with a PCE of 8.30% , whereas the PCE of PTBBO is 6.90% . Nanomorphology controls of polymer : fullerene bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) films are of great importance for achieving high solar cell efficiencies in BHJ organic photovoltaics ( OPVs ) devices. 1-8 To maximize free charge carrier generation and collection , the polymer and fullerene materials should develop a nanostructure such that their interface area is maximized , while typical dimensions of phase separation are within the exciton diffusion range ( ∼ 10 nm ) and continuous pathways for charge carrier transport to the electrodes are ensured. 7,9-12 Additionally , it is required to form optimal polymer : fullerene nanostructures of the blend film in such a way to maximize open - circuit voltages ( V oc s ) because variations in the film morphology can modulate the device V oc . 13-15 To achieve high solar cell efficiencies , a thorough understanding of the relationship between the molecular structures of the polymer and the BHJ nanomorphology and the solar cell properties is necessary. In particular , it is important to identify a correspondence between polymer - fullerene interactions and photovoltaic properties at a molecular level. 16,17 One of challenging tasks in the morphology control is to design conjugated polymers with good compatibility with fullerene derivatives. Most attempts to improve the miscibility of the polymer with the fullerene derivatives have been limited to tuning the properties of the polymer through modifying alkyl side chains such as the alkyl chain length and the bridging point. 18-24 In some cases , fullerene molecules were found to intercalate between the neighbored polymer side chains and formed well intermixed morphology. 25,26 Morphology control at a nanoscale was performed by introducing various polymer end - cappers , which effectively change the surface energy of the polymer and thus the miscibility with fullerenes.",

    "sentence": "27 The miscibility of the molecules can be characterized in terms of the Hansen solubility parameters ( δ ) of the blend components ; materials with similar values of δ are likely to be mutually miscible via intermolecular interactions. 28-31 Therefore , to increase the miscibility of the polymer with fullerenes , it would be beneficial to introduce functional moieties with Hansen solubility parameters close to those of fullerene derivatives as side chains , such as the o-dichlorobenzyl group ( DCBZ ). 28 o-Dichlorobenzene ( ODCB ) is a good solvent for fullerene derivatives as well as conjugated polymers and has been used as a representative solvent for processing polymer BHJ films. In addition , dipole moments generated on the ODCB side chain terminal are expected to play favorably for better molecular packing of the polymer and thereby better charge carrier transport. Herein , we investigated morphological properties of polymer : fullerene BHJ films of push - pull - type random copolymers containing the DCBZ group at the ends of their alkyl side chains. In our study , we chose poly(thienothiopheneco-benzodithiophene) as the basic polymer backbone because it is a good low bandgap polymer for the BHJ solar cells. 32,33 Tuning the molar portion of the DCBZ functionalized side chain in the polymer effectively controlled the miscibility of the polymer and PC71BM and thus optimized the nanoscale phase separation in the polymer : PC71BM BHJ active layer , resulting in the improved short - circuit current ( J sc ). Moreover , the introduced DCBZ group was demonstrated to induce changes in the PC71BM 's electronic structure , which resulted in the increased lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of PC71BM at the interface of polymer / PC71BM and thereby the enhanced V oc of polymer BHJ solar cells. As a result , DCBZ-based polymer solar cells achieved a high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) up to 8.30% . We introduced the DCBZ group into the polymers via random copolymerization of 2-butyloctyl 4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno- [ 3,4- b]thiophene-2-carboxylate ( TT-BO ) , 4-(3,4- dichlorobenzyloxy)butyl 4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]- thiophene-2-carboxylate ( TT-DCBZ ) , and 2,6-bis-(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT-EH ). These monomers were synthesized by following modified literature procedures 21,34 and the polymerization was carried out via the Stille coupling polymerization 35 with the prepared monomers at feed ratios of TT-BO:TT-DCBZ = m : n ( mol : mol ) = 1 : 0 , 0.75 : 0.25 , 0.5 : 0.5 , and 0 : 1 to produce PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 , respectively ( Figure 1a ). The polymerized products were precipitated in methanol , and purified by performing successive Soxhlet extractions with methanol , hexane , and chloroform. The molecular weights of PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 were estimated with gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) at 80 °C and found to be M n = 69 , 70 , 65 , and 51 kg / mol with polydispersity indices ( PDI ) of 2.8 , 2.5 , 2.3 , and 2.5 , respectively.",

The absorption spectrum is slightly red - shifted as the proportion of TT-DCBZ in the polymer increases and thus the onset point ( λ onset ) and maximum peak ( λ max ) are redshifted by ∼ 10 nm from PTBBO ( λ onset = 745 nm , λ max = 675 nm ) to PTBDCB100 ( λ onset = 756 nm , λ max = 683 nm ). The optical energy bandgaps ( E g s ) of PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , and PTBDCB50 are estimated to be ∼ 1.66 eV from the onset points of the absorption spectra and PTBDCB100 shows a decreased E g value of 1.64 eV. The electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ). The electron affinity ( EA ) and the ionization potential ( IP ) energies of the polymers were determined from the onset of the reduction and oxidation potentials , respectively as shown in Table 1. 33,36 Both of the IP and EA energies of the polymers were shifted up as the molar ratio of the TT-DCBZ in the polymer backbone increased and thus , the IP energy of PTBDCB100 ( 4.95 eV ) was 0.22 eV lower than 5.17 eV of PTBBO. Incorporation of the DCBZ group would induce conformational changes of the polymer backbone , which resulted in the red - shifted UV - vis absorption spectra and the change in electrochemical properties.

The current - voltage ( J-V ) curves of the polymer solar cell devices are shown in Figure 2a and the best and average values of their characteristic photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 2. Overall , the polymers containing DCBZ exhibit better solar cell performances than PTBBO due to their improved J sc values. In the histograms of statistical J sc values ( Figure 2d ) , the DCBZbased polymer showed ∼ 1 mA / cm^2 higher values. In the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of the polymer solar cells ( Figure 2b ) , the EQE values for the range 450-800 nm of all the polymers containing DCBZ are higher than that of PTBBO. The onset point of the PTBDCB100 EQE spectrum is slightly red - shifted with respect to those of the other polymers due to its lower energy bandgap.",

However , when the DCBZ content of the polymer is increased above that of PTBDCB25 , the solar cell efficiency gradually decreases , which is mainly due to decreases in FF. As a result , PTBDCB100 showed the lowest PCE of 6.96% among the DCBZ based polymers with a FF of 0.589. The V oc values of the polymer devices are in the range 0.76 - 0.77 V and notably , higher than 0.74 V of PTBBO despite that the IP energies of the DCBZ based polymers ( 4.95 - 5.10 eV ) are 0.07 - 0.22 eV lower compared with PTBBO ( 5.17 eV ). Furthermore , the V oc of PTBDCB100 ( 0.76 V ) is a significantly improved value compared with PTB1 ( 0.58 V ) and PTB2 ( 0.60 V ) polymers in spite of their similar polymer structures and IP energies ( 4.8 eV for PTB1 , 4.94 eV for PTB2 , and 4.95 for PTBDCB100 ) to each other. 21 Regarding this , we will discuss further in the next \" theoretical study \" section. By tuning the weight ratio of the polymer : PC71BM composite from 1 : 1.5 to 1 : 1 , the solar cell efficiency of PTBDCB25 was further improved up to 8.30% with a J sc of 16.22 mA / cm^2 , a V oc of 0.76 V , and a FF of 0.673 ( Figure 2c ). To investigate the influence of the DCBZ functionalization of the polymer on the polymer solar cell properties , we investigated the nanostructural properties of the polymer : PC71BM BHJ films in the solar cell devices with transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ). Figure 3 shows the TEM images of the BHJ blend films. It is found that the size and density of dark regions due to PC71BM aggregation decreases as the TT-DCBZ content in the polymer increases. The PTBBO blend film contains 100-200 nm PC71BM - rich domains , whereas the PTBDCB25 and PTBDCB50 blend films have more uniformly intermixed morphologies with nanoscale percolating networks. PTBDCB100 has a homogeneous morphology with very fine features , which indicates that the miscibility of PTBDCB100 with PC71BM is very high. The improved nanomorphology of the DCBZ incorporated polymer blend film is advantageous for enhancing charge carrier generation at the polymer / PC71BM interface in the polymer BHJ solar cells and thereby improve J sc s ; the nanoscale phase separation will increase the probability that the exciton reaches the interface and is dissociated into charge carriers when considering the limited exciton diffusion lengths of conjugated polymers due to the short exciton life times.",

    "sentence": "38 As shown in the out of plane GIXD profile of the polymer : PC71BM blend film , the incorporation of the DCBZ group into the polymer results in a weaker scattering peak of PC71BM than that of PTBBO. Full widths at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of scattering peaks correlated to nanocrystallite sizes via the Scherrer equation ( DL = 2 ( ln2 / π ) 1 / 2 2π(Δq) -1 , where Δq is the intrinsic fwhm of the peak ). 39 In the in-plane GIXD profile ( Figure S5 ) , Gaussian fits were used to determine peak FWHMs , as represented using black solid lines for the peak profiles. The measured Δq values are 0.266 , 0.293 , 0.296 , and 0.274 Å -1 for PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 , respectively. Thus , the calculated PC71BM crystallite sizes in the blend films are estimated to be 22.17 , 20.13 , 19.92 , and 21.52 Å , for PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 , respectively. This result implies that the crystallinity and sizes of the PC71BMnanocrystallites were reduced after incorporation of the DCBZ unit. The high crystallinity of PC71BM in the PTBBO : PC71BM film would correlate with the high level of PC71BM aggregation evident in the TEM image of the PTBBO : PC71BM film. In general , conjugated polymers with high π-π stacking properties exhibit lower miscibility with fullerene derivatives because their selforganization properties disturb intermixing with other compounds and thus lead to large scale phase segregation. 40,41 The nanoscale phase separation of the PTBDCB50 and PTBDCB100 blend films is much improved although PTBDCB50 and PTBDCB100 show more effective π-π stacking structures than that of PTBBO. This is probably due to the enhanced intermolecular interactions between the DCBZ group and PC71BM such as the chlorine-fullerene or dipole-π interactions , 42,43 which result in better compatibility between the polymers and PC71BM and thereby in the well intermixed polymer : PC71BM blend films. Taken together , the TEM and GIXD results show that the introduction of DCBZ groups into the polymers dissolves aggregated PC71BM clusters in the polymer : PC71BM blend films by making the polymer chains more miscible with PC71BM. We compared the surface energies of the polymers calculated using Owens - Wendt geometric mean equation. It is reported that when the surface energy values of the individual components of the blend films are similar , they exhibit better miscibility , which leads to more homogeneously mixed film morphologies. 16,44 software package.

Athough DFT with B3LYP functional has been commonly used , it has been proved that this method could not properly describe dispersive interactions. Therefore , we employed D3 version of Gremme 's dispersion with Becke - Johnson damping ( GD3BJ ) to investigate the intermolecular interaction of PC71BM - polymer complexes adequately.",

    "sentence": "45 The configurations of the energy optimized structures of PC71BM - monomer and PC71BM-side chain complexes are shown in Figure 6. The interaction energy of PC71BM with 3,4-dichlorobenzyloxybutane ( DCBB ) ( 14.61 kcal / mol , Figure 6b ) is larger than that with 2-butyloctane ( BO ) ( 10.45 kcal / mol , Figure 6a ). Interestingly , the enhancement value of 4.16 kcal / mol is comparable to the increase of the interaction energy from 41.1 to 47.71 kcal / mol in the PC71BM - monomer complex system when a 2-butyloctyl side chain in the monomer is replaced by a 3,4-dichlorobenzyloxy)butyl group in Figure 6c,d. The stabilization energy values of the PC71BM-DCBB complex were calculated with varying the distance between PC71BM and DCBB and recorded in Figure S6. The distance yielding the highest stabilization energy ( 3 Å ) is identical to that between the PC71BM and DCBZ group in the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ complex ( Figure 6d ). This result indicates that the incorporation of the DCBZ into the polymer makes PC71BM - polymer interactions energetically favorable and thus increases the miscibility of the polymer with PC71BM. Moreover , the DCBZ group may act to hold the PC71BM molecules so as to prevent large scale phase segregations when polymer : PC71BM blends form BHJ films in polymer solar cell devices. Frontier orbitals and energy diagrams of the PC71BM - monomer complexes are shown in Figure 7a. For both monomers , the HOMO of the complex is essentially confined on the monomer donor while the LUMO is on the PC71BM acceptor. The HOMO energy levels of the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ and PC71BM-PTBBO complexes are , in common , shifted up by 0.13 - 0.14 eV from the HOMO levels of their respective isolated monomer molecules. Interestingly , compared with the computed LUMOs of PC71BM , the LUMO of PCBM-PTBDCBZ is increased by about 0.05 eV while that of PC71BM-PTBBO is decreased by about 0.01 eV. As a result , the energy bandgap of PC71BM-PTBDCBZ is 0.08 eV larger than that of PC71BM-PTBBO. This is consistent with the observation of the larger V oc values for the DCBZ incorporated polymers ( 0.76 - 0.77 V ) than for PTBBO ( 0.74 V ) despite that the former polymers have 0.07 - 0.22 eV lower IP energy levels , as determined by the CV experiment. For a deeper understanding of the effects of the intermolecular interaction between the DCBZ group in the polymer and PC71BM on the energy levels of the complex , we detached the DCBZ group from the complex and observed the resulting energy levels ( Figure 7b ) ; the LUMO energy level was lowered to -3.45 eV and became similar to that of the isolated PC71BM ( -3.46 eV ) while the HOMO level ( -5.18 eV ) remained close to that of PC71BM-PTBDCBZ ( -5.19 eV ) , suggesting that the DCBZ group in the polymer predominantly influenced the LUMO energy level of the PC71BM - polymer complex.",

    "sentence": "In addition , we investigated how the LUMO energy level of PC71BM is affected by the interactions with DCBB because the LUMO of the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ complex is mostly localized on PC71BM and reflected by PC71BM 's LUMO. As shown in Figure S7 , on forming a PC71BM-DCBZ complex , the LUMO level of PC71BM is increased to -3.41 eV , which is identical to the LUMO level of the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ complex. By contrast , the LUMO level of PC71BM is shifted down when the polymer interacts with BO , in agreement with the result obtained for the PC71BM-PTBBO complex. As shown in Figure S8 , changing the distance between PC71BM and DCBB resulted in different frontier orbital energy levels of PC71BM. In particular , the LUMO level at 3 Å , which was found to be the optimal distance for the effective interaction between PC71BM and DCBZ , is identical to that of the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ complex. From the computational results , it is expected that the DCBZ in the polymer induced the increase of the LUMO level of PC71BM positioned at the PC71BM / polymer interface of the BHJ solar cell devices by the intermolecular interactions between the PC71BM and the DCBZ group , resulting in the V oc enhancement of the DCBZ-based polymer solar cells. It is observed that the geometry of the PC71BM detached from the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ ( PC71BM cpx ) complex differs from that of the original structure ( PC71BM org ) ( Figure S9 ) , leading to a decrease in the dipole moment from 4.59 D for PC71BM org to 4.55 D for PC71BM cpx. The computed total energy of PC71BM is increased by about 0.48 kcal / mol after the deformation. It is expected that the intermolecular interaction between PC71BM and the DCBZ group in the complex led to the changes in both the geometry and the electronic structure of PC71BM , resulting in the increase in the LUMO energy level. To further clarify the effects of the morphological changes on the photovoltaic properties , we performed a series of experiments as follows. First , we assessed the charge carrier mobilities of the devices ; a high charge carrier mobility reduces bimolecular charge recombination after free charge carrier generation. 46,47 The hole mobilities of the polymer : PC71BM BHJ films were measured by using the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method ( Figure S10 ). The mobilities of the blend films were found to be 1.6 × 10^-4 , 1.3 × 10^-4 , 9.8 × 10^-5 , and 7.0 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 , respectively ; as more DCBZ is incorporated into the polymer , the mobility in its blend film gradually decreases. This gradual decrease probably arises because charge transport is more disturbed by the limited transport pathway as the polymer is more miscible with PC71BM.",

Thus , the higher photocurrent levels of the DCBZ-based polymer devices can not be explained in terms of charge transport and other factors need to be explored.

From the calculated energy offsets between the LUMO energy levels of the polymer and PC71BM ( ∼ -3.7 eV ) , 21 each polymer solar cell is expected to have sufficient driving force to produce efficient charge transfer / separation at its polymer / PC71BM interface. In fact , the photon energy losses of the polymer devices , which are defined by E g - eV oc , are similar , with values of 0.92 , 0.89 , 0.90 , and 0.88 eV for PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 , respectively. These results suggest that the polymers have similar quantum efficiencies of charge generation. 48 Third , photocurrent generation is usually explained in terms of nongeminate recombination. We determined the dependence on light intensity of the photocurrent density for each of the PTBBO and PTBDCB25 solar cell devices , in order to characterize their recombination mechanisms. This dependence can be modeled with a power law relationship J ∝ P α where P is the power generation rate and the deviation of α from unity is due to bimolecular recombination and the buildup of space charges in the active layer. 49-51 Figure S7 shows the photocurrent densities ( J ph = J L - J D ) as functions of light intensity at the various effective voltages , where J L and J D are the current density under illumination and in the dark , respectively. The effective voltage is defined as V eff = V 0 - V appl , where V 0 is the compensation voltage at J ph = 0 and V appl is the applied voltage. For both of the polymer devices , there is a linear relationship between the logarithmic scales of the photocurrent density and the light intensity at V eff values of 0.1 V , short - circuit , and 1.5 V , respectively , and at the given V eff , the slops of the polymers are very similar to each other ; the slopes are ∼ 0.91 at the short - circuit condition and V eff = 1.5 V , and 0.81 - 0.82 at V eff = 0.1 V. The result indicates that the degrees of bimolecular recombination and space charge effects are similarly small for both of the polymer solar cells.",

    "sentence": "50,51 Finally , the enlarged interface area in the polymer : PC71BM blend films with the introduction of DCBZ into the polymers might result in increases of the probabilities that the photogenerated excitons reach the polymer : PC71BM interfaces and separate into free charge carriers. To verify this hypothesis , we examined the photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching of polymer : PC71BM blend films prepared under the same conditions as the solar cell active layers. Parts a and b of Figure 8 show the PL spectra recorded with excitations at 380 and 675 nm , respectively , and the maximum PL peaks of PC71BM and the polymers are at 700 and 750 nm , respectively. In the pristine polymer films , all polymers showed almost identical PL spectra to each other. It is found that the PL quenching degree at both 700 and 750 nm is correlated with the DCBZ content of the polymer ; the polymers with a higher DCBZ proportion exhibit a higher degree of PL quenching. In particular , because the PL from excitation at 380 nm is PC71BM emission dominant , 6,52 the degree of PL quenching after 380 nm excitation is able to stay relative to nonradiative quenching of excitons within the PC71BMnanoclusters by the polymer. Two mechanisms possibly contributed to the quenching of PC71BM emission in the blend film : hole transfer to the polymer or resonant energy transfer ( RET ) to the polymer. The PL spectrum of PC71BM is well overlapped with the absorption spectra of the polymers in the range of 670-800 nm. Both of the quenching processes are dependent on the distance from the exciton to the polymer chain present near the polymer : PC71BM interface. 53-55 Therefore , from the relative PL intensity for the 380 nm excitation , we can estimate the relative sizes of the PC71BMnanoclusters and the total polymer / PC71BM interface areas of the blend films : for the PC71BMnanocluster sizes PTBBO > PTBDCB25 > PTBDCB50 > PTBDCB100 and for the interface areas PTBDCB100 > PTBDCB50 > PTBDCB25 > PTBBO. These results confirm that the incorporation of DCBZ at the terminal of the side chains makes the polymer chains more miscible with PC71BM and thus increases the polymer : PC71BM interface area , which results in more efficient charge carrier generation and thereby the J sc enhancement in the solar cells. As a result , the improvement in the photocurrent densities of the devices with the polymers containing DCBZ is mainly due to the improved exciton dissociation into free charge carriers. This is mostly contributed by the increased polymer / PC71BM interface area resulting from the better miscibility of the polymers containing DCBZ with PC71BM. However , excessive DCBZ incorporation resulted in decreases in FF ( for the PTBDCB25 device , FF = 0.651 , and for the PTBDCB100 device , FF = 0.589 ) , which are due to the reduction in charge transport arising from limited pathways in the excessively intermixed BHJ film.",

    "sentence": "Therefore , it is vital to optimize the morphology of the polymer : PC71BM blend film with respect to phase separation by incorporating an proper amount of the DCBZ group into the polymer . We have presented the control of the molecular interaction of polymer and PC71BM via the synthesis of push - pull - type random copolymers containing various ratios of TT-DCBZ and TT-BO accepting units and their effects on photovoltaic properties. Introduction of the DCBZ group into the polymer resulted in several positive effects. First , the DCBZ group enhanced the compatibility of the polymer with PC71BM without having detrimental effects on the polymer 's physical properties such as its optical properties or polymer packing structures in the solid state. Therefore , we can obtain optimal film morphology for achieving high solar cell efficiencies. More importantly , the interaction between PC71BM and DCBZ induced the PC71BM 's molecular geometry to a higher energy state and changed the PC71BM 's electronic structure. This led to the increase of the PC71BM 's LUMO level and thereby the enhanced V oc . Additionally , because of the versatility of this copolymerization - based approach , it can be readily extended to other conjugated polymeric systems for use in polymer : fullerene BHJ based solar cells. As a result , by tuning the ratio of TT-DCBZ and TT-BO monomers , the polymer solar cell employing PTBDCB25 was fabricated with a PCE of 8.30% . We believe that the random copolymerization of monomers with fullerene - compatible functional groups is an effective way for simultaneously enhancing J sc and V oc by controlling the nanomorphology and the electronic structure of acceptors in donor : acceptor BHJ solar cells. We are exploring other fullerene - compatible functional groups to obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of formation of polymer : fullerene BHJ films and their effects on the photovoltaic properties .",

The effects of the different conjugated side groups on the thermal , photophysical , electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these copolymers were investigated. As the length of the conjugated side groups increased , the absorption of the UV - vis region in solution was red - shifted. By changing the different side groups , the energy levels and band gaps of the resulted copolymers were effectively tuned. The three copolymers exhibit deep HOMO energy level and relatively high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ). Bulk heterojunction solar cells with these copolymers as electron donors and (6,6)-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) as an electron acceptor exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 2.48% , 4.18% and 1.16% for PT-ID , PT - DTBT , and PT - DTBTID , respectively . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their potential for low cost , lightweight , and good compatibility with the roll - to - roll process for making flexible large area devices. 1-3 So far , the most successful polymer solar cells are bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) devices , 4-7 which use a phase separated blend of organic electron donor and acceptor components , where the conjugated polymer is often used as the donor and the fullerene derivative is used as the acceptor. 8 It has been realized that an ideal polymer donor in PSCs should exhibit broad absorption with high absorption coefficient in the visible region , high hole mobility , suitable energy level matching with the fullerene acceptor , and appropriate compatibility with the fullerene acceptor to form nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network. 9 Optimizing the properties of the polymer donor will offer higher short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , fill - factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSCs. One feasible approach toward broadening the absorption spectrum and tuning the energy levels is to design alternating donor - acceptor ( D-A ) copolymers , in which the hybridization of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) located on the donor moiety with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) located on the acceptor moiety provides a means of narrowing the band gap and tuning the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers. 10,11 Among these main chain D-A copolymers , it has been demonstrated that benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene ( BDT ) is the most potential and effective electron - rich donor unit. 12 In the past two years , a series of new D-A low band gap polymers based on BDT have been reported.",

In order to broaden the absorption spectra of the π-conjugated polymers , 1,3-indanedione ( ID ) and 4,7-dithien-5-yl-2,1,3-benzodiathiazole ( DTBT ) as electron - deficient units are to be introduced into side chains of PT-ID and PT - DTBT , respectively. Furthermore , a long side chain ( DTBT-ID ) composed of DTBT and ID is introduced to form the polymer PT - DTBTID. These conjugated side groups attached to the main chains via vinylene groups. The vinylene linkage serves to enhance coplanarity of the polymer backbone and extend the π-conjugation by further eliminating torsional strains between the main chain and electron - deficient side groups , leading to a lower optical band gap and tunable frontier molecular orbital energy levels. The effects of the conjugated side groups on the thermal , photophysical , electrochemical , and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers were investigated in detail .

The good thermal stability of the copolymers retards the deformation of the polymer morphology and the degradation of the active layer at elevated temperatures , which are desirable for polymers in PSCs applications. 20 Photophysical Properties. The photophysical properties of the copolymers were investigated by UV - vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The correlative data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 2. Figure 4 gives the UV - vis absorption spectra of PT-ID , PT - DTBT , and PT - DTBTID in diluted CHCl 3 solution. All copolymers show two distinct absorption bands. The first absorption bands with the absorption maxima ( λ s,max ) at 423 nm for PT-ID , 390 nm for PT - DTBT and 387 nm for PT - DTBTID can be identified with a delocalized excitonic π-π* transition and the second absorption bands of them with λ s,max at 565 , 504 , and 526 nm , respectively , can be attributed to a localized transition between donor - acceptor charge transfer states. 21,22 PT - DTBTID exhibits the broader absorption which derived from the ICT interaction between the main chain and the conjugated side chains. 23 Obviously , the ICT interactions of the PT - DTBTID are progressively enhanced due to the increase of the electron affinity of the DTBTID group. 10 In comparison with the absorption spectra of the polymer solutions , the absorption spectra of the films are broadened and the peaks are red - shifted. This phenomenon results from the enhanced interchain interaction in the solid films , which is probably related to the increased extent of π-π stacking of the backbones and increased polarizability of the film , or both. 24-26 The optical band gaps ( E g opt ) of PT-ID , PT - DTBT and PT - DTBTID are 1.75 , 1.92 , and 1.66 eV , respectively , calculated from the onset of the film absorptions.

    "sentence": "That is because the electron deficient nature of the DTBTID group provides a wider photo responsive range ( Figure 8 ) , but it can also act as a trapping site , inhibiting electron transfer from the main chain to the acceptor and as a result to produce low IPCE values and poor photovoltaic performance for PT - DTBTID. 37 In addition , the bulky side chain ( DTBTID ) of the PT - DTBTID leads to a significant decrease in J sc , consequently , a decrease in the PCE of the solar cell. PT - DTBT with DTBT as the side chains shows the highest PCE due to the highest J sc and V oc . Therefore , the side group DTBT seems to be better than ID , and ID seems to be better than DTBTID. To further understand the cause of variation in solar cell performance , the hole mobility of these copolymers was measured using the OTFT technique under the same conditions. The mobility values of the copolymers are listed in Table 3. PT - DTBT with the DTBT side chain demonstrated a relatively high hole mobility of 3.2 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 which is two order higher than those of PT-ID ( 6 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) and PT - DTBTID ( 3 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) ( Table 3 ). Furthermore , the hole mobility of PT-ID is double of PT - DTBTID. Therefore , the high hole mobility of the PT - DTBT further clearly explain why the photovoltaic properties of the PT - DTBT are better than those of PT-ID and PT - DTBTID . In summary , three novel alternating copolymers based on benzo 1,2-b:4,5-b′ dithiophen and thiophene with different conjugated side groups have been successfully synthesized and characterized. The three copolymers show good solubility and film - forming ability. Through manipulating the length of the acceptor groups attached at the conjugated side chains of the copolymers , the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the copolymers are effectively tuned. The best power conversion efficiency of the PSCs based on PT - DTBT / PC61BM ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) reached to 4.18% under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . The broad absorption spectrum , deep HOMO level and the noticeably high hole mobility of PT - DTBT contribute to the outstanding J sc , V oc as well as the high device efficiency .",

XRD diffraction measurements have shown that these polymers have a short p-p stacking distance in the solid state. The results demonstrate that these conjugated polymers could be promising donor materials in the application of polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells have experienced two rapid development periods aer the appearance of the bulk heterojunction concept for the active layer and the use of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) conjugated polymers as the donor materials. 1 The innovations in materials and device structure have boosted the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs to higher than 10% . 2,3 The active layer of a bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell is a blend of donor and acceptor , which forms an interpenetrated network for highly efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation and the transportation of the formed free charges. 4,5 To achieve high efficiency polymer solar cells , some design criteria of p - type polymer donors are ( i ) low lying HOMO energy level to increase the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) ; ( ii ) narrow band gap to broaden the absorption range to achieve higher short - circuit current ( J sc ) ; ( iii ) high hole mobility for charge transport. Alternating the D-A approach , which involves the copolymerization of an electron rich monomer with an electron decient monomer , is the most attractive and successful strategy for controlling the energy level and optical band gap of copolymers through the intramolecular charge transfer from donor to acceptor unit.

Thermal properties of P1-3 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) at a scanning speed of 10 °C min -1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. A 5% mass loss is dened as the thermolysis threshold. As shown in Fig. 1 , P1-3 exhibited good thermal stability and the thermolysis onsets of P1 , P2 , and P3 are located at 316 , 438 , and 399 °C , respectively. The data are also summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. S1 ( see ESI ) , † for all polymers , no noticeable thermal transition was observed from 25 to 300 °C by DSC measurements , which is probably attributed to the stiff backbone that limits the chain motion . The packing of polymer chains in the solid state plays a pivotal role in determining the hole mobility of polymer lms and the power conversion efficiency of PSCs. Therefore , X-ray diffractions ( XRD ) of P1-3 powdery samples were performed to investigate the packing of polymer chains in the solid state and the diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. S2. † P1 and P3 exhibited ve sharp diffraction peaks ; whereas the diffraction peaks for P2 became weaker and broader. The rst peak ( d 1 ) , usually denoted as the ( 100 ) reection , 53 at the small angle region can be attributed to the distance the conjugated polymer chains were separated by the two extended alkyl chains. The interchain separation distances are 20.45 , 20.75 , and 20.11Å for P1 , P2 , and P3 , respectively. The last diffraction peak ( d 2 ) , usually denoted as the ( 010 ) diffraction , 53 at the wide angle region probably corresponds to the p-p stacking distance between polymer backbones. The p-p stacking distances are 3.49 , 3.61 , and 3.47Å for P1 , P2 , and P3 , respectively. These results indicated that P1 and P3 formed a more ordered and closer packing in the solid state than P2. The close packing of P1 and P3 polymer chains in the solid state is probably due to the following two reasons. For P1 , the existence of intramolecular S-O interactions endows the polymer backbone with a more planar conformation ; 54,55 whereas for P3 , the existence of uorine atoms in the polymer backbone usually enhances the interchain interactions and makes the polymer chains pack closer.

Compared with solution absorption spectra , the absorption spectrum of P1 as a thin lm became broader and red - shied. A new absorption peak at 700 nm appeared , which can be ascribed to the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. The absorption spectra of P2 in DCB solutions at room temperature and elevated temperature are almost the same ; whereas the absorption spectrum of P2 as a thin lm is broader and red - shied with two absorption bands in the long wavelength region with peaks at 621 and 668 nm , respectively , indicating the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state.

The high energy band is attributed to the p-p* transition and the low energy band originates from the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) from the donor unit to the acceptor. Optical band gaps ( E opt g ) of P1 , P2 , and P3 lms estimated from absorption edges of lm spectra are 1.60 , 1.63 , and 1.62 eV , respectively. The narrower band gap of P1 than that of P2 and P3 is probably due to the incorporation of electron donating alkoxy side groups on the benzothiadiazole moiety of P1 , which elevates the HOMO energy level and decreases the band gap. The broad absorption and small optical band gap make these polymers promising materials for PSCs. The photophysical parameters are also tabulated in Table 2 .",

CV curves of the polymer lms are shown in Fig. 3 , and the electrochemical data are also summarized in Table 2. HOMO energy levels of P1 , P2 , and P3 were calculated to be -5.44 , -5.49 and -5.52 eV , respectively , from the onset of oxidative peaks using the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ) , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential in volts. Considering that the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of PSCs is correlated to the difference in the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , the deep HOMO level of P1-3 is prone to give high V oc PSCs. The two substituents on the benzothiadiazole unit can slightly affect the HOMO energy level of copolymers. The HOMO energy level of non-substituted benzothiadiazole based P2 is -5.49 eV. P1 with two electron donating octyloxy substituents on the 5,6-positions of the benzothiadiazole unit showed the highest HOMO energy level of -5.44 eV within these three polymers. The introduction of two electron withdrawing uoro substituents on the 5,6-positions of the benzothiadiazole unit can lower the HOMO energy level of copolymers. P3 has the lowest HOMO energy level of -5.52 eV. Therefore a higher V oc is expected for P3 - based PSCs.

    "sentence": "The ability to increase light harvesting while maintaining a deep highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and high solubility remains challenging when designing new conjugated polymers as materials for polymer photovoltaic applications. 9 In attempts to harvest more photons and to tune the energy levels , several polymers have been developed featuring conjugated electron donor / acceptor ( D / A ) units in their main chain 10-25 or two - dimensional ( 2-D ) conjugated configurations. 26-38 At present , the efficiencies of PSCs are now reaching beyond 10% as a result of our better understanding of the photon - to - electron conversion mechanism and the development of novel materials and tandem device architectures. 39-42 Thiophene - containing polymers are among the materials most investigated for use in BHJ PSCs because of their π-conjugated character and high synthetic versatility ; accordingly , an effective method to modify the optical and electronic properties of such polymers is to replace the sulfur ( S ) atoms within their aromatic rings with selenium ( Se ) atoms. Selenophene is a chalcogenophene homologue that has chemical and physical properties similar to those of thiophene ; the relatively lower aromaticity of selenophene increases the ground - state quinoid resonance character of its resulting polymers , leading to improved planarity , increased effective conjugation length , and lower band - gap energy. The Se atom is much larger and less electronegative than the S atom ; thus , Secontaining polymers are generally more effective at extending the absorption spectrum toward the infrared region. In addition , the Se - containing units are more polarizable than their S - containing analogues , often resulting in greater charge mobility of the polymer as a result of interchain Se°°°Se interactions. Indeed , Se - based conjugated polymers provide the opportunity to enhance the interchain interactions and the carrier transport phenomena because the heteroaromatic interactions of Se atoms are generally stronger than those of S atoms , favorable for applications in organic field effect transistors ( OFETs ). 43-45 Similarly , the conductivity and charge mobility of selenophene - based polymers are greater than those of corresponding thiophene - based polymers because of greater π-overlap resulting from the larger π-orbitals of Se atoms. 46 Recently , it was reported that replacing the S atoms with Se atoms in the π-bridges of conjugated polymers can decrease the band - gap energy and enhance the charge transport properties in OFETs. 44,45 The photovoltaic performance of these Secontaining polymers was , however , lower than that of corresponding polymers containing thiophene π-bridges , primarily a result of higher HOMO energy levels and , thus , lower values of V oc for the photovoltaic devices. 47-52 Nevertheless , a low-band-gap polymer containing selenophene π-bridges that provided a promising PCE of 7.2% , significantly higher than that ( 5.01% ) of the corresponding polymer incorporating thiophene π-bridges , was reported.",

The incorporation of Se atoms into polymers decreases PCEs primarily because of higher HOMO energy levels 47-52,54-57 and limited solubility , 54,55 thereby leading to lower values of V oc and less - appropriate nanomorphologies of their PCBM - blended thin films. Nevertheless , the questions remain on how and why the performances of such organic electronic devices differ so greatly. Elucidating the relationship between structure - manipulated molecular aggregates and device performance is fundamentally important for both device optimization and the structural design of new copolymers. In this study , we chose benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) , a weak electron donor , 64,65 as the electron - rich unit ; it is attractive for use as an electron - donating unit because of its structural symmetry and rigid fused aromatic systemfeatures that can enhance electron delocalization and improve charge mobility. 66 To improve the solubility of polymers containing the Se - containing versions of this heterocycle , we added two alkoxy groups to the electron - deficient moieties to form benzooxadiazole ( BO ) as the acceptor ; we also used thiophene as the π-bridge for mitigating the torsion angle between the BDT and BO units. To investigate the effect of the Se atom substitution , we synthesized eight 2-D conjugated D-π-A copolymers having different modes of Se substitution on the side chain , the πbridge , and the electron - deficient building block.

First , when we replaced the side chain group from thiophene to selenophene ( e.g. , P1 ↔ P4 , P2 ↔ P6 , P3 ↔ P7 , P5 ↔ P8 ) , the HOMO energy levels did not drift. Second , when a selenophene moiety replaced a thiophene unit in the 2-D conjugated polymer in the π-bridge , the HOMO energy level increases slightly , from -5.46 to -5.4 eV ( e.g. , P3 and P7 ). Third , when the Secontaining units replaced the electron - deficient building blocks , the BS moiety dominated , increasing the HOMO energy level to -5.29 eV ( e.g. , P2 , P5 , P6 , and P8 ). Thus , by replacing S atoms with Se atoms , the HOMO energy levels increased slightly , while those of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( LUMOs ) decreased slightly. The narrowing of the band gap arose mainly through the electron - stabilizing effect of the selenophene moieties because Se is a more polarizable atom than either an S or O atom. Theoretical Calculation. We used density functional theory ( DFT ) to calculate the geometrical structures and absorption spectra of two repeating units ( dimer - like structure ) of each of the eight polymers ( Scheme 1 ).

Only the lowest energy conformations are reported herein. We also calculated the frontier molecular orbitals ( HOMO , LUMO ) at the same level of theory. We investigated the electronic nature of the absorption bands through TDDFT 78 calculations at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d) level in vacuo media , up to 10 excited states.

Finally , for the polymer P4 , in which the Se atoms appeared only on the side chains , we calculated no change in the dihedral angle in the main backbone. Indeed , for all the polymers with Se atoms substituted into the side chain thiophene units , the torsion angles remained unchanged. Next , we investigated the changes that occurred upon substituting Se atoms into various groups in the two repeating units of PBDTTTBO ( P1 ) and examined the properties of the frontier orbitals ; Table S2 lists the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the HOMO-LUMO gaps ( HLGs ) calculated at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d) level.

Table S1 also displays the frontier molecular orbitals ( FMOs ) , the HOMOs and LUMOs , of the P1-P8 dimers , calculated at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d) level.

Replacing the active layer with the low - bandgap donor polythieno [3,4-b]thiophene-co-benzodithiophene ( PTB7 ) and acceptor [6,6]phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) , a prominent PCE as high as 8.02% is achieved. It is worthy to note that this is the first time that n - type conjugated polyelectrolyte - based interlayer is reported. Inspiringly , quite different from p - type conjugated or nonconjugated PEs , the high electron mobility and conductivity benefitted from the n - type feature and solid - state packing can effectively alleviate the thickness limitation and make PDPPNBr capable of functioning efficiently in a wide thickness range of 6 to ∼ 30 nm. This characteristic of the solution processed n-CPE ETL provides the feasibility of large - area rollto - roll manufacturing techniques. Additionally , the PDPPNBr interlayer also can ensure the device with an improved long - term stability. These findings indicate this unprecedented alcoholsoluble n - type CPE could be a desirable candidate for the interfacial layer materials in highly efficient and stable PSCs . The synthesis and structure of the n - type conjugated polyelectrolyte PDPPNBr are shown in Scheme 1 ( synthesis details are provided in the Supporting Information ). Compound 1 reacted with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxoborolane to afford DPP - based compound 2. Then , the copolymer PDPPBr was first prepared by the Suzuki coupling polymerization between compounds 2 and 3.",

The final dark - purple solid was easily soluble in the common organic solvents such as chloroform , chlorobenzene , and toluene at room temperature. The ionized copolymer PDPPNBr was obtained through an almost quantitative quaternization by treating the copolymer with a trimethylamine in tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) solutions at low temperature. 24,36 Because of the existence of the ammonium salt polar pendant groups , the resulted n-CPE PDPPNBr can be readily dissolved in polar solvents including methanol , dimethylformamide ( DMF ) , and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ). The comparison photographs of the copolymer PDPPBr and its corresponding n-CPE PDPPNBr dissolved in methanol solution are shown in Figure 1. It can be observed that the copolymer PDPPBr presents a large amount of precipitate at the bottom of the bottle , while the n-CPE PDPPNBr shows a clearly blue methanol solution , thanks to the ammonium salt polar groups. In addition , all the intermediates and final product have been thoroughly purified , and the chemical structures of the products were characterized by spectroscopic methods , from which satisfactory analysis data were obtained ( for the corresponding 1H NMR and 13 °C NMR of the intermediates and final product see the Experimental Section in Figures S1-S3 of the Supporting Information ). The ultraviolet - visible ( UV - vis ) absorption spectra of the copolymer PDPPBr and the conjugated polyelectrolyte PDPPNBr in solution and solid states are shown in Figure 1. Owing to the same backbone of PDPPBr and PDPPNBr , the copolymer and conjugated polyelectrolyte solutions maintain similar absorption bands. However , the maximum absorption wavelength ( λ max ) of both thin films displays an obvious red - shift ( ∼ 150 nm ) relative to that of their corresponding solutions , resulting from intermolecular interactions of the diketopyrrolopyrrole backbone favoring the strong solid - state packing. The frontier molecular orbital energy of copolymer PDPPBr and the conjugated polyelectrolyte PDPPNBr was calculated from the cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) , which is presented in Figure S4. Based on the reduction potential ( -0.78 eV ) and the oxidation potential ( 0.75 eV ) , the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) and the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of PDPPNBr are estimated to be -3.62 and -5.15 eV , respectively. The physiochemical properties of the copolymer are summarized in Table S1. The energy levels are well consistent with density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations with the Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP / 6-31g(d) level for copolymer PDPPBr , as shown in Figure S5. After optimizing the geometrical structures with a fixed repeating structure , the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are -4.89 and -2.96 eV , respectively. Furthermore , the torsion angle between the two thiophene rings is only 6 ° tilted from the planar geometry , which would be in favor of the charge transfer.",

    "sentence": "37,38 The polar side chain in the polyelectrolyte is preferable to form an aligned dipole moment at metal / organic material interface , which can modify the work function ( WF ) of the electrode by inducing a vacuum - level shift. 39 To characterize the WF change of PDPPNBr - modified ITO electrode , ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( UPS ) was carried out. A thin layer of PDPPNBr with a thickness of approximately 12 nm was deposited on the ITO substrate. As shown in Figure 2a , the bare ITO exhibits a typical WF value of 4.84 eV , in accordance with the literature , 17 while the WF moves to 4.12 eV by 0.72 eV shift when ITO is modified with PDPPNBr. Upon deposition of PDPPNBr on ITO , the negative bromide counterions tend to be located near the hydrophilic ITO , whereas the hydrophobic conjugated polymer backbone preferentially locates on the surface ( as shown schematically in Figure 2b ) , 39,40 which would spontaneously give rise to the formation of interfacial dipole at the ITO / PDPPNBr interface. The dipole moment pointing away from the ITO surface to active layer makes the substantial reduction of WF through the swift down of the vacuum level ( E vac ) of the substrates closer to that of the active layer. Consequently , the interfacial dipole formation at ITO / PDPPNBr interface can lower the Schottky barrier and favor a better energy alignment to facilitate the electron injection and transport from the photoharvest layer to ITO. In order to further confirm the electronic property variation obtained from the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy , the Kelvin probe method was employed to determine the work function of ITO / PDPPNBr , and result of the commonly efficient 19 deposited on ITO substrate ) was also presented for comparison. Figure 2c demonstrates that the bare ITO and the reference ITO / ZnO exhibit the work function value of -4.70 and -4.41 eV , respectively , in agreement with the literature. 17 Coating a layer of PDPPNBr on ITO leads to a remarkable reduction of WF compared with the bare ITO ( -4.25 eV vs -4.70 eV ). Note that the WF of ITO / PDPPNBr is even lower than that of ITO / ZnO ( -4.25 eV vs -4.41 eV ). The reduced WF of ITO / PDPPNBr is very close to the LUMOs of PC61BM and PC71BM , which can form an ohmic contact with the active layer and smoothly transport the electrons from fullerene acceptor to the ITO cathode ( Figure 2d ). Figure S6 displays the hydrophilic alteration of bare ITO , ITO / ZnO , and ITO / PDPPNBr. The bare ITO exhibits a water contact angle of ca. 73 ° . After a layer of the so - gel ZnO nanoparticles spin - coated on the ITO , the contact angle to deionized water of ITO / ZnO decreases to ca. 60 ° .",

The more hydrophobic surface of ITO / PDPPNBr again gives a direct proof to verify that the negative bromide counterions tend to locate at the hydrophilic ITO , whereas the hydrophobic conjugated polymer backbone preferentially locates at the side of organic active layer ( Figure 2b ). The increased hydrophobic surface of ITO / PDPPNBr allows for the more imitated contact with upper active layer. Moreover , the calculated surface energy of ITO / PDPPNBr ( 30.67 mN / m ) is closer to PC61BM and PC71BM ( 28.1 mN / m ) than P3HT ( 23.8 mN / m ) , which would be beneficial to a vertical phase separation of the active layer. 42 Additionally , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was also employed to determine the morphology of the bare ITO , ITO / ZnO , and ITO / PDPPNBr. As shown in Figure 3 , the bare ITO exhibits a roughness root-mean-square ( rms ) of 3.29 nm. After being spin - coated with a thin layer ZnO nanoparticles , the surface becomes smoother with a decreased rms of 1.23 nm , while upon deposition of the PDPPNBr on ITO substrate , a relatively rougher surface with a rms of 3.59 nm is obtained. Since the surface wettability and morphology of electrode have been altered by covering a layer of PDPPNBr , it is expected to influence the deposition of the active layer. Thereby , AFM was conducted to investigate the morphology of active layer deposited on bare ITO , ITO / ZnO , and ITO / PDPPNBr. The P3HT:PC61BM active layer was spin - coated on these substrates and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. Seen from the images in Figure 3 , the P3HT:PC61BM deposited on bare ITO and ITO / ZnO substrates exhibits a roughness rms of 3.1 and 1.8 nm , respectively. It is worthy to note that the PFN , a well - known interlayer for state - of - art PSCs , is not suitable for P3HT:PC61BM devices due to the poor compatibility between interlayer and active layer. Delightfully , deposition of P3HT:PC61BM on the ITO / PDPPNBr develops a robust and uniform film with a roughness rms of 4.3 nm , suggesting a good contact of ITO / PDPPNBr with P3HT:PC61BM. The difference in roughness of P3HT:PC61BM is caused from the morphology variation of the substrates. It has been reported a rougher surface of the active layer would facilitate the interfacial adhesion between subsequent hole extraction layer and the active layer ; therefore , an improved charge transport can be anticipated. 43,44 In addition , a uniform microphase separation of P3HT:PC61BM is well developed on the ITO / PDPPNBr substrate , which would be very helpful for charge separation and transportation.

As displayed in Figure S7 , the transmittances of ITO / PDPPNBr with different thickness are almost identical to that of the bare ITO , inferring that this n-CPE is suitable as interlayer. Figure 4 shows the illuminated current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves of devices based on P3HT:PC61BM with PDPPNBr as the ETL , and the detailed photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The best PCE of 4.03% , together with an open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.65 V , a short circuit current density ( J sc ) of 8.95 mA / cm^2 , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 69.29% , is achieved from the device based on PDPPNBr with an optimized thickness of ∼ 12 nm ( Figure 5a ). The device with the ultrathin PDPPNBr cathode interlayer ( 6 nm ) delivers the lowest PCE of 2.9% , presumably due to the incompletely covered interlayer on the ITO electrode. More intriguingly , when the thickness of PDPPNBr increases to 20 and 29 nm , the PCEs of the devices still remain at the high values of 3.68% and 3.41% , respectively. As we all know , most polyelectrolytes ( usually based on p - type conjugated or nonconjugated backbone ) as interlayers are very sensitive to the thickness , and the thickness limitation is always less than 10 nm. For instance , the optimized thickness of the well - known cathode interlayer PFN is found to be 5-6 nm , 33 and further increasing the interlayer thickness results in a sharply decreased device efficiency. This is because the p - type conjugated or nonconjugated backbone is not beneficial for electron transport ; therefore , the electron extraction from active layer to cathode mainly relies on the electron tunneling effect. 45 In order to further confirm this opinion , the control device based nonconjugated polyelectrolyte polyethylenimine ethoxylated ( PEIE ) ETL was fabricated ; the contrastive parameters are shown in Table S2. It is obvious that the PEIE could also tune the interface energy alignment so that a superior V oc was obtained , whereas the inferior J sc was probably caused by the nonconjugated backbone with a poor conductivity. Additionally , increasing the interlayer thickness will inevitably increase the bulk resistance of the interlayer , consequently leading to the sharply decreased electron extraction and transportation. For the PDPPNBr ETL , when the thickness increases from 6 to 29 nm , the series resistance ( R s ) only slightly increases from 1.95 to 13.28 Ω cm^2.",

    "sentence": "To explore the reason behind the unique PDPPNBr ETL , the electron mobility of PDPPNBr in the solar cell devices is estimated using the space - charge limited current ( SCLC ) method according to the Mott - Gurney equation. 46-48 As plotted in Figure 5b , the device with bare ITO shows an electron mobility of 2.08 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . After incorporation of PDPPNBr as ETL , the electron mobility is remarkably enhanced to 5.70 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which is even higher than that of ZnO ETL ( 3.78 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) ( Table S2 ). In addition , the conductivity of the ZnO and PDPPNBr interlayer was also investigated and compared. As shown in Figure 5c , PDPPNBr displays more superior conductivity over ZnO ( 9.98 × 10^-6 S cm^-1 vs 7.89 × 10^-6 S cm^-1 ) , and its conductivity is even 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of PFN interlayer ( 6.9 × 10^-9 S cm^-1 ). 49 The high electron mobility and conductivity of PDPPNBr interlayer mainly originate from the n - type character and the dense packing of planar DPP units , which should be responsible for the highly maintained performance devices with the thick ETL. This novel interlayer could provide the feasibility of large - area roll - to - roll manufacturing techniques. Superiority of the PDPPNBr ETL can be clearly verified by comparing the devices performances with ITO / PDPPNBr , ITO / ZnO , and bare ITO. From Figure 4 and Table 1 we can see that all of the devices with PDPPNBr ETLs show significantly improved PCE than the control device with bare ITO ( 0.85% ) , and PDPPNBr with a thickness of 12 , 20 , and 29 nm even achieves a higher PCE than the widely used ZnO ETL ( 3.24% ). And the highest efficiency obtained from PDPPNBr ( 4.03% ) shows 374% and 24% improvement over those obtained from bare ITO and ZnO interlayers , respectively. The remarkable improvement in PCE is a result of the overall improved V oc ( from 0.37 to 0.65 eV ) , J sc ( from 7.63 to 8.95 mA / cm^2 ) , and FF ( from 30.2% to 69.3% ) , suggesting a more favorable charge injection and collection are achieved at the electrodes. The simultaneously increased V oc and J sc values are related to the better energy alignment induced by the dipole moments created from the PDPPNBr with polar groups , which is in good agreement with the UPS and Kelvin probe observation. As revealed by Table 1 , compared with bare ITO and ITO / ZnO - based devices , incorporation of PDPPNBr ETL into the device can significantly reduce the series resistance ( R s ) and increase the shunt resistance ( R sh ) , indicating a good interfacial modification to boost charge injection and suppress charge recombination.",

Moreover , the desirable morphology of the active layer and favorable interface contact observed from AFM and water contact angle measurement should also account for the J sc and FF enhancement. The highest performance promoted by the PDPPNBr ETL can be further elucidated by the most restrained leakage current in the dark J-V curve ( Figure S8 ). The theoretical J sc obtained by integrating the corresponding external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) data ( in Figure 4d ) is also well consistent with the current values from the J-V characteristic. To further confirm and testify the universality of this novel PDPPNBr ETL , the inverted PSCs devices based on the lowbandgap polymer polythieno [3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene ( PTB7 ) as a donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as a acceptor were fabricated. The corresponding J-V characteristics and devices parameters are summarized in Figure 6a and Table 1 , respectively. As expected , with respect to the bare ITO and ZnO modified ITO electrode , the PDPPNBr modified ITO cathode yields the best PCE as high as 8.02% with a V oc of 0.75 V , a J sc of 15.10 , and a FF of 70.8% . Similar to the device with P3HT:PC61BM , the notable efficiency of device with PTB7 : PC71BM is also mainly attributed to the overall improved device parameter , including V oc , J sc , and FF. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) curves of the devices are presented in Figure 6b. It can be seen that the PDPPNBr - based device shows the highest EQE value , in accordance with the values obtained from the J-V characteristics in Figure 6a. Table 1 demonstrates that all of the PDPPNBr - based devices show the dropped R s and enhanced R sh than the bare ITO and ITO / ZnO - based devices , regardless of the active layer. It can be concluded that incorporation of PDPPNBr ETL into the devices can significantly improve charge injection and suppress charge recombination. To gain deeper insight into the influence of PDPPNBr interlayer on the recombination mechanism in the devices , an additional measurement with respect to the V oc and J sc of the ZnO and PDPPNBr based devices at various light intensities from 23 to 100 mW cm^-2 was carried out. In conclusion , a novel alcohol - soluble conjugated polyelectrolyte PDPPNBr based on n - type backbone is first synthesized and applied as ETL in high performance PSCs. The feature of the conjugated backbone of the polyelectrolyte has significantly impact on the properties. The planar DPP backbone with n - type nature endows the PDPPNBr with high conductivity and electron mobility. The interfacial dipole moment created by n-CPE PDPPNBr can substantially reduce the work function of ITO and induce a better energy alignment in the device , facilitating electron extraction and decreasing exctions recombination at active layer / cathode interface.",

Copolymerization of the donor , with a higher HOMO ( highest occupied molecular orbital ) energy level , and the acceptor , with a lower LUMO ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) energy level , results in a lower band gap polymer due to an intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) from the donor to the acceptor. 14,15 Another approach to designing low - band gap conjugated polymers is the introduction of electron - releasing effects , such as long flexible alkyl and alkoxy chains , to increase the conjugation length. 16,17 However , pendant chains can give rise to affect steric interactions and the coplanarity of the polymer backbone , resulting in a change of the optical and electrochemical properties of the donor-acceptor polymers. Among the various conjugated polymers , polyfluorene and polycarbazole derivatives have deep HOMO levels that increase the open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of the PSCs. 18,19 Recently , Leclerc et al. reported a systematic study of PSCs using various poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives. In that work , the researchers varied the electron - withdrawing unit of the polymers. 20,21 Poly[N-9 00 -heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4 0 ,7 0 -di-2-thienyl-2 0 ,1 0 ,3 0 -benzothiadiazole ) ( PCDTBT ) and PC61BM composites provide a promising efficiency of 3.6% . Further optimization of the device for PCDTBT led to a PCE of 6.1% . 6 However , all these polymers , except for PCDTBT , show hole - mobility values between 10^-5 and 10^-4 cm^2 / ( V s ) in organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) , resulting in a low power - conversion efficiency of 1-2 % .",

The field - effect hole mobility as well as the electronic energy levels and processability of the materials for PSC applications were investigated.

Although the backbone of the copolymers with similar structure have been described in the literature except differences in the solubilizing side chains , 22-25 the effect of the alkoxy side chains on the electronic , optoelectronic , and photovoltaic properties has not been reported for PSCs based on polymers with quinoxaline units. Compared to P1 , the alkoxy side chains on the quinoxaline units , which have been used earlier in other polymers for solar cells , 26 can enhance the solubility and the charge transfer to electron acceptors such as PCBM. In general , bulky side chains have a negative effect on the carrier mobility , since interchain hopping of carriers requires a favorable overlapping of the electron wave function of adjacent conjugated units on the polymer main chains. 27 Therefore , from the viewpoint of π-π* stacking , the quinoxaline-(Qx-) based copolymers with different side chains were designed and synthesized. We systematically investigated the synthesis , thermal stability , optical and electrochemical properties , field - effect carrier mobilities , and photovoltaic characteristics of the resulting polymers.

All the polymers exhibited a good thermal stability , showing less than 5% weight loss at temperatures up to 400 ° C. Compared to P1 , P2 and P3 have a lower glass transition temperature ( T g ) , which is attributed to the alkoxy side chains on the quinoxaline units. The physical properties of the polymers are summarized in Table 1. Optical Properties. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform and in the spin - cast film are shown in Figures 1 and 2 , respectively , and the corresponding absorption properties are summarized in Table 2. Both in solution and in the films , the polymers exhibited two distinct absorption bands : one at about 375-400 nm and the other one in the range : 495-545 nm. The nature of these bands , observed for the low - band gap polymer with push-pull units , still remains to be elucidated. Jesperson et al. attributed the highest energy band to a π-π* transition whereas the lowest energy band was assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the donor and the acceptor. 28,29 To obtain further information about the ICT electronic structure of the polymers , we carried out density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations for the model compound using the DMol 3 software. Figure S1 ( Supporting Information ) shows the calculated molecular orbitals of the model compounds. As shown in Figure S1 , the HOMO was delocalized over the polymer backbone , whereas the LUMO was highly localized on the Qx unit ( Supporting Information ). The red shift observed for P2 and P3 , compared to P1 , is due to the introduction of the benzene groups on the quinoxaline unit and not electron - donating effect of the alkoxy chains on the para position of the benzene rings. The dihedral angle between the benzene rings and the quinoxlaine rings are significant , as can be seen from the calculated structures ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ). However , this result currently lacks a theoretical explanation. The absorption maxima of the polymer films are red - shifted by 25-33 nm compared to those of the polymer solutions. This red - shift indicates higher coplanarity of the polymer and / or enhanced intermolecular electronic interactions in the solid state. The optical band gap obtained from the extrapolation of the absorption edges of the film are in the order of P3(1.91 eV ) < P2(1.97 eV ) < P1(2.01 eV ). The smaller band gap should help improve the absorption efficiency in the solar spectrum. Electrochemical Properties.

The electrondonating alkoxy groups in P2 and P3 slightly raise the HOMO level and consequently reduce the band gap of the copolymer. Unfortunately , it was difficult to obtain the LUMO energies for the copolymers using this technique , so these values were estimated from the optical band gaps ( taken as the absorption onsets of the UV-vis spectra for the polymer films ) and the HOMO energies. 32 The energies of the LUMO levels of P1 , P2 , and P3 are listed in Table 2.

The higher mobility measured for P2 can be understood in terms of the better solubility and π-π* stacking. 27 The hole mobility determined for P2 is 1 order of magnitude higher than that for P3.

The V OC value is closely related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the electron acceptor , PC71BM. 35 As expected from the HOMO energy levels of the polymers , those polymers with the same backbone units have a similar V OC value because of their almost identical electronic structures. However , the trend of V OC for P1 does not seem to fit the electrochemical potentials , which can be explained in terms of the morphology of the blended film. A low solubility has an impact on the mechanical properties of the film , the interface resistance , and the nanoscale morphology , resulting in a low open - circuit voltage and a low fill factor. 21 Figure 5 shows atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) images ( 1 μm x 1 μm scan area ) of the blend film ( polymer : PC71BM = 1 : 3 ) for a better understanding of the device characteristics. P2 shows homogeneously well - distributed small - sized domains whereas P1 exhibits larger polymer-PC71BM domains and phase separations. These results indicate that P2 may form a well - distributed bicontinuous interpenetrating network of polymer-PC71BM domains , showing good agreement with the improved current-voltage characteristics observed for this system in comparison to the other polymers. The measured short - circuit current ( J SC ) for P1 , P2 , and P3 was 2.70 , 9.96 , and 6.24 mA / cm^2 , respectively. These results are also in good agreement with the OFET measurements.

Convolution of the spectral response with the photon flux of the AM 1.5 G spectrum provided an estimate of the value of J SC under irradiation. The calculated J SC value for the P2 - based devices was 8.46 mA / cm^2. Because of the discrepancy between the EQE results and the photon flux under AM 1.5 illumination , an approximate mismatch of 15% was present between the convolution and the solarsimulator data. 36 Although the values of V OC and J SC were high , those of the fill factors were low.",

For conventional conjugated polymers , it is hard to match well with all the demands mentioned above. Generally , to obtain a high V oc , one of the most effective approaches is to lower the HOMO energy level of polymer , while too low HOMO value would lead to a wide band gap of the polymer , and in turn reduce the short - circuit current density. To achieve high efficiencies of PSCs , researchers have developed a new family of polymers with conjugated side groups or side chains , which can increase the open - circuit voltage and short - circuit current density at the same time. In our previous research , we designed and synthesized a series of copolymers which contained a BDT group and a thiophene group in the main chain , and DTBT derivatives as the side chains.",

The second absorption bands with l s,max at 510 and 513 nm , respectively , can be attributed to a localized transition between donoracceptor charge transfer states. 22,23 PT-Tz-DTffBT exhibits a slightly broader absorption which is derived from the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) interaction between the main chain and the conjugated side chains. 24 Obviously , the ICT interactions of PT-Tz-DTffBT are progressively enhanced due to the increase of the electron affinity of the DTffBT group.",

The absorption coefficient of PT-Tz-DTffBT is higher than that of PT-Tz-DTBT due to the introduction of uorine atoms to the side group. In comparison with the absorption spectra of the polymer solutions , the absorption spectra of the lms are broadened. The absorption peaks are red - shied. This phenomenon might result from the enhanced interchain interaction in the solid lms , which is probably related to the increased extent of p-p stacking of the backbones and increased polarizability of the lm. 16,26,27 The optical band gaps ( E opt g ) of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT are 1.91 and 1.92 eV , respectively , calculated from the onset of the lm absorptions . The electrochemical behavior of the copolymers was investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). The corresponding CV curves and data of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT lms are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2. The redox potentials were referenced to the ferrocene / ferrocenium redox couple ( Fc / Fc + ). The redox potential of Fc / Fc + was assumed to have an absolute energy level of 4.8 eV in a vacuum. 28 The redox potential of ferrocene is 0.71 V vs. SCE. On the basis of 4.8 eV below vacuum for the energy level of Fc / Fc+ , the HOMO / LUMO energy levels and electrochemical energy gaps ( E ec g ) of copolymers were calculated according to the following equations : E ec g = e(E ox - E red ) ( eV ) The onset potentials for oxidation ( E ox ) are observed to be 1.49 and 1.50 V for PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT , respectively. The HOMO energy levels of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT were at -5.58 eV and -5.59 eV , respectively. It has been demonstrated that the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) value in BHJ solar cells is linearly dependent on the difference between the HOMO level of the p - type polymer and the LUMO level of an n - type PC61BM. 29 The two conjugated copolymers with side - chains show a similar HOMO energy level , which predicts that they would achieve a similar V oc value to the resulting PSCs. Besides , two copolymers exhibit deeper - lying HOMO energy levels than -5.20 eV , indicating their good air stability under ambient conditions. 30 The relatively deep - lying HOMO energy levels of the two copolymers may be due to the introduction of the thiazole unit in the backbone , which also contributes to the lower HOMO energy levels of the two copolymers , compared with our reported research.",

The charge carrier transport properties of conjugated polymers play a key role in the performance of PSCs. To understand the inuence of charge carrier mobility of the copolymers / PC61BM blend lms on the photovoltaic properties , the hole mobility of the target copolymers was measured by using a space charge limit current ( SCLC ) method. Hole - only devices were fabricated with the conguration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 30 nm ) / Polymer : PC61BM / MoO 3 ( 10 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ).

The calculated average hole mobilities of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT blend lms are 1.8 x 10^-3 and 2.5 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. The hole mobility of PT-Tz-DTffBT increases due to the uorine substituent , from the DTBT unit to the DTffBT unit. And the noticeable increase of hole mobility by the uorine substitution may contribute to the enhancement of J sc ( 7.75 - 9.05 mA cm^-2 ) and FF ( 0.45 - 0.54 ) ( see below ). In short , the hole mobilities of the two copolymers are relatively high , which is one of the reasons that we obtain the high power conversion efficiencies . In order to check whether the conjugated side groups and the thiazole unit of the two copolymers make a contribution to the photoelectric conversion in the PSCs , the bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with four devices , three conventional sandwich structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 30 nm ) / copolymer : PCBM ( x 100 nm ) ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) / LiF ( 0.5 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ) mixing copolymer with PC61BM or PC71BM , and an inverted device of ITO / TIPD ( 12 nm ) / copolymer : PC71BM ( x 100 nm ) ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) / MoO 3 ( 24 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ).

The photovoltaic parameters , including the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , the ll factor ( FF ) , and the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) , are summarized in Table 3. Note that PSCs based on PT-Tz-DTffBT demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than PT-Tz-DTBT , with a PCE of 3.75% . In comparison with PT-Tz-DTBT , PT-Tz-DTffBT shows a higher J sc of 9.05 mA cm^-2 , which is consistent with the IPCE spectrum. Notably , the copolymer PT-Tz-DTffBT which contains two uorine atoms in the side group has the higher PCE value than PT-Tz-DTBT , which is due to the increase of the FF value and J sc value , which can also be ascribed to the increase of the hole mobility. For other testing conditions , we found no further improvement by using 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) as the additive. In addition , the photovoltaic properties of PT-Tz-DTffBT were investigated in BHJ solar cells using PC71BM as the acceptor. We obtain the power conversion efficiency of 3.65% ( J sc = 8.92 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.80 V , FF = 0.51 ). Although the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) improved from 0.76 V to 0.80 V , both J sc and FF decreased , so the PCE of PT-Tz-DTffBT has no further improvement ( Table 3 ). In order to better understand the device characteristics , we have also fabricated an inverted PSC with the device structure of ITO / TIPD ( 12 nm ) / PT-Tz-DTffBT:PC71BM ( x 100 nm ) ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) / MoO 3 ( 24 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ). A high PCE of 4.42% has been demonstrated , with the highest J sc of 10.11 mA cm^-2 , the highest V oc of 0.88 V , and a FF of 0.50 ( Table 3 ). Obviously , the enhanced PCE beneted from the improvement in J sc and V oc , which were attributed to the reduced photodegradation of the copolymer active layer presumably. 35 It is noteworthy that the PCE improved signicantly from 2.63% of PT-Tz-DTBT to 3.75% of PT-Tz-DTffBT. This can account for the obvious increase in J sc as revealed by incidentphoton - to - current efficiency ( IPCE ) spectra ( Fig. 7 ) which may result from the better charge transfer and the decrease of electron aggregation by improving the miscibility between PT-Tz-DTffBT and PC61BM. As we know , the FF value is mainly determined by lm morphology. The better morphology of the copolymers could be benecial to a higher FF. Fig. 8 shows the surface morphology of the active layers of copolymer : PC61BM ( 1 : 2 w / w ) in AFM height images and phase images.",

Two copolymers appeared promising for the application in BHJ solar cells due to their good solubilities , low band gaps as well as their high hole mobilities. The broad absorption spectrum , deep HOMO energy level and the noticeably high hole mobility of PT-Tz-DTffBT contributed to the outstanding J sc and V oc values as well as the high PCE of 3.75% .

The conjugated polymers of the biTV - PTs show broad and strong absorption from 380 to 650 nm and high power conversion efficiency of the PSCs based on the biTV - PTs was obtained. 11b In this paper , we synthesized the bi(thienylene vinylene ) substituted poly(thienylene vinylene)s ( biTV - PTVs ) , for further extending the absorption of the conjugated polymers to a longer wavelength region , in considering that PTVs possess narrower band gap and broader absorption band than PTs. 12 The biTV - PTVs could also be called as branched poly(thienylene vinylene)s because the composition of the conjugated side chains is the same with the main chains.

[8][9][10][11] However , the design of ideal polymer donors remains a challenge to achieve both high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , and fill factors ( FF ). 1 They must possess at least the following characteristics such as good solubility , broad absorption band , and appropriate energy levels of highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) , since these properties are closely related to the above-mentioned key parameters of BHJ solar cells. 12 Recently , benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene ( BDT ) has been widely explored as a donor unit in the design of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) polymers for BHJ cells due to its lower HOMO energy level and broader UV - Vis absorption properties. [13][14][15][16] The high hole mobility endowed by BDT units is also advantageous for PSCs application , indicating by a hole mobility up to 0.81 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 in single crystal transistor for BDT - based small molecule. 17 A large spectrum of BDT donating units have been developed bearing different substituents , such as alkyl , 18 alkylthio 19 and 50 alkylthienyl. 20 Particularly , the conjugated polymers based on thienyl substituted BDT have shown good potential in BHJ devices. The bis(dialkylthienyl) benzodithiophene based polymer PBDTT - FID exhibited a PCE of 7.04% in BHJ cells. 21 Among the large number of A units explored , dithienyl-55 benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) has attracted great attention for its property of energy levels for D-A polymers. 22,23 Especially , the introduction of fluorine atom onto dithienyl-benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) could increase the PCE of DTBT - based polymer solar cells. 24 The improvement was attributed to an optimal 60 morphology of the active layer likely due to fluorine substitution. 25 The impact of fluorination on BT was further elaborated by associating a BDT motif as weak donor and 5,6difluorinated or non-fluorinated BT groups. The introduced fluorine as side chains was found to greatly affect the morphology , processability and device efficiency due to intermolecular interactions , even though the polymers shared similar bandgaps.",

In this work , we have herein designed and synthesized two new polymers by alternating mono-fluorinated benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( fBT ) or dodecylthienyl subsitituted BT ( fTBT ) as acceptor unit with bis(4,5-bis(octylthio)thienyl substituted BDT ( BDTTs ) as donor unit. The BDTTs motif was 80 chosen as a weak donor unit because bis(octylthio) possesses strong electron - donating capacity and thienyl substitution helps to improve hole mobility , lower the HOMO level and broaden the absorption band. 27 The thermal , optical and electrochemical properties of the resulted polymer were systematically studied . The best BHJ device fabricated from PBDTTs - fBT and PC71BM as the active layer showed a maximum PCE of 6.27% , with a J sc of 11.7 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.89 V and a FF of 60.5% .

The corresponding polydispersity index ( PDI ) was 3.80 and 4.25. PBDTTs - fTBT presented the highest M n due to 35 the existence of solubilising alkylthienyl side chains. The thermal property of two polymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ). As shown by the TGA traces in Fig. S1 , good thermal stability was observed for both polymers , indicated by the high Td(temperature corresponding to 5% 40 weight loss ) of 357 and 372 °C for PBDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT , respectively. The good thermal stability endows the polymers great potential for their application in optoelectronic devices. 28 The UV - vis absorption spectra of the polymers in both 45 chloroform solutions ( ~ 10^-5 M ) and solid films are shown in Figure 1a , with the wavelengths of absorption maximum ( λ max ) summarized in Table 1.",

Polymers PBDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT solutions in 50 chloroform exhibit quite similar absorption profiles , where strong absorption band in the range of 300 ~ 650 nm is observed with λ max peaking at 585 and 577 nm , respectively. In contrast , PBDTTs - fTBT exhibit 8 nm blue - shifted absorption band in comparison to PBDTTs - fBT , due to the introduction of 55 alkylthienyl into fBT. The polymer films present wide absorption bands in the range of 300 ~ 650 nm with a λ max peaking at 598 for PBDTTs - fBT and 597 nm for PBDTTs - fTBT , respectively. BDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT thus exhibited 13 and 20 nm red - shifted absorption band when transferred from their solution 60 to films , indicating the occurring of more strengthened conjugation in solid state. A close look at the optical results of PBDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT , one would find that the introduction of an alklythienyl substituent to BT core leads to a ~ 10 nm blue - shifted absorption spectra , mainly due to the expanded conjugated system and the electron - donating effect of thienyl group. In comparison to PBDTTs - fBT , PBDTTs - fTBT shows more red - shifted absorption when transferred from solution to film , suggesting the enhanced steric hindrance over 2D conjugated BT moiety when substituted with aromatic 70 functionality. The wavelength of absorption onset ( λ onset ) of polymer film was determined as 788 and 730 nm for PBDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT , respectively.

Two polymers underwent an irreversible oxidation , similar to other BDT based D-A polymers. 19 The onset potential for oxidation ( E onset ox ) was observed to be 1.11 and 1.08 V for PBDTTs - fBT 85 and PBDTTs - fTBT , respectively. With E onset ox at hand , the HOMO levels of two polymers could thus be calculated ( Table 1 ). The LUMO levels of two polymers were further calculated to be -3.94 eV for PBDTTs - fBT and -3.79 eV for PBDTTs - fTBT by using the equation of LUMO = HOMO + E g opt ( eV ). 28 The result indicated the deep HOMO levels ( ≤ -5.0 eV ) of these 2D conjugated bis(alkylthio) BDTT polymers would be beneficial for obtaining high V oc in BHJ solar cells.",

    "sentence": "The power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells based on polymer - fullerene blends are approaching the benchmark value of 10% for single - junction cells , [1][2][3][4] largely ascribable to the rapid advancement of novel donor polymers. [5][6][7][8][9] Among different strategies to molecularly engineer conjugated polymers for BHJ solar cells , the alternating \" donor - acceptor \" ( D-A ) concept has prevailed because it offers a high level of flexibility in tuning absorption spectra and frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the resulting D-A copolymers. For example , it becomes increasingly evident that the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest occupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of a D-A alternating copolymer can be approximated by the HOMO level of the \" donor \" ( D ) structural unit and the LUMO level of the \" acceptor \" ( A ) unit , respectively. 8 This important feature has enabled the design of polymers with a low HOMO level in conjunction with a low band gap , in order to simultaneously achieve a high open circuit voltage ( V oc ) and a high short circuit current ( J sc ). 10 While the structures of the aromatic units in these D-A copolymers have largely decided the photovoltaic performance of the BHJ solar cells , 11 other structural parameters can also have strong influence , for example , these peripheral side chains , [12][13][14] and functional substituents ( e.g. , fluorine ). [15][16][17] Thus , to further advance the PCE values , one popular approach is to molecularly engineer and finetune the structure of top performing D-A copolymers ; 9,18,19 however , such a strategy can only lead to incremental increases on the PCE , if successfully demonstrated. On the other hand , a 45 more challenging yet more rewarding strategy is the creative design and synthesis of novel structural units and related polymers. Such a strategy has been playing a crucial role in maintaining the upward trend of the device efficiency towards the predicted PCE of 15% for polymer BHJ solar cells. 20-24 50 The structural units , either \" donor \" ( D ) or \" acceptor \" ( A ) in these D-A alternating copolymers , are often based on fused aromatics , typically via annulation of different small aromatic units ( e.g. , benzene , thiophene , pyrrole , pyridine , etc. ). One such example is the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene ( BDT ) , an benzannulated 55 compound with two fused thiophenes.

However , in the solid state as thin films , both two main absorption peaks red - shifted remarkably by 30 nm and 51 nm , locating at 423 nm and 595 nm , respectively , and became broader when compared to those in solution. In addition , a new identifiable shoulder peak near 650 nm emerges , which is believed to represent the degree of the interchain stacking as reported for other polymers. 42,43 The large red - shifts and presence of the shoulder peak indicate enhanced intermolecular interactions and strong aggregation among the individual polymer chains in thin films. This broad absorption and well - ordered packing of polymer chains would benefit the J sc and the charge carrier ( i.e. , hole ) mobility. Finally , a relatively small optical band gap of 1.71 eV was estimated for PBDSe - DTBT , calculated from the onset of the film absorption. To estimate the frontier orbital energy levels , cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements were performed on the PBDSe - DTBT thin film drop - cast on a glass carbon disk , using a standard threeelectrode configuration. As shown in Figure 2a , quasi reversible oxidation and irreversible reduction processes were detected.

In summary , the optical and electrochemical properties of PBDSe - DTBT support our design rationale of adopting the unique advantages of angular - shaped \" donor \" moiety and Se heteroatom to obtain both a low optical band gap and a low - lying 50 HOMO level in D-A copolymers , with the ultimate goal to achieve both an increased J sc and a high V oc in BHJ solar cells.",

The current - voltage ( J-V ) curves and photovoltaic properties of BHJ devices with the maximal efficiency at each processing condition are displayed in Figure 3a and Table 2 , respectively. As expected , relatively high V oc of ~ 0.8 V was observed in all PBDSe - DTBT : PC71BM based BHJ solar cells , consistent with the low - lying HOMO energy level of PBDSe - DTBT. Combined with a higher average J sc of 8.9 mA cm^-2 , the BHJ device with PBDSe - DTBT : PC71BM at a 1 : 1 weight ratio gave the highest 15 PCE of 2.7% among all the blending ratios studied ( without additives ) , primarily due to a low FF of 0.37. However , with the addition of 1% 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) as the processing additive in the polymer : fullerene solution , 46 the PCE was dramatically improved up to 5.6% , with a significant increase on both J sc 20 ( 12.30 mA cm^-2 ) and FF ( 0.57 ) ( Figure 3a ). To the best of our knowledge , this is the highest PCE value among all reported BHJ solar cells based on conjugated polymers containing angularshaped benzodithiophene derivatives. [31][32][33]47 To shed more light on the observed increase of J sc when the processing additive was added , we compared the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of the optimized devices processed with and without the additive , as shown in Figure 3b. The device processed from 1% DIO additive exhibits a slightly broader EQE response ( i.e. , from 350 nm to over 700 nm ) than that of the device from the additive - free processing. However , the EQE value of the device processed with the additive is noticeably higher across the entire photoresponse range , with the maximum EQE reaching 60% . The much improved EQE is directly related with the increased absorption of the blend film processed with the additive ( see Supplementary Information Figure S3 ) , and also likely benefits from a better charge carrier extraction due to improved mobility and morphology by applying the processing additive ( vide infra ) . It is generally agreed that a desirable morphology of BHJ films would include polymer - rich and fullerene - rich domains of 10-20 nm in domain sizes , connected through the polymer / fullerene 50 intermixed domains. 48 Furthermore , both crystalline regions and amorphous regions are important.",

    "sentence": "All these morphological characteristics contribute to achieving high J sc and FF. 4,49 For example , too large a domain of high purity would negatively impact the exciton dissociation , while too small a domain with 55 excellent mixing of polymer and fullerene would impede the charge transport. 50 To probe the morphological features of these BHJ blended processed under different conditions , we first applied atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to investigate the top surface morphology of the blend films ( Figure 4 ). The obtained 60 height images show that the BHJ blend film processed with 1% DIO has a larger root-mean-square roughness ( RMS ) of 9.6 nm ( Figure 4a ) , compared with a RMS of 0.4 nm ( Figure 4c film processed without any additives. The relative coarse surface morphology in the DIO-processed film , indicated by its larger RMS value , could be attributed to the self - organized ordering or the crystalline domain of the polymer ( PBDSe - DTBT ) in the BHJ blend , as frequently reported for other DIO processed polymer : fullerene films. 49,51 This relatively ordered structure can improve the charge carrier mobility , which would facilitate the carrier transport and attenuate the charge recombination , thereby enhancing the J sc and FF. On the other hand , the phase images ( Figure 4b ) offer some insights on the phase separation. Compared with the featureless phase image of the BHJ film without any additives , the DIO processed blend film shows more favorable phase separation with rather uniform and moderate domain sizes of ~ 20-30 nm. This close to \" ideal \" domain size would benefit the exciton dissociation and lead to a higher J sc . To probe the structural order / molecular packing in these BHJ 20 films , we applied grazing incident X-ray diffraction ( GIXRD ) to investigate thin films of both the pristine polymer and its BHJ blends ( Figure 5 ). The pristine PBDSe - DTBT thin film displays a distinguishable [100] diffraction peak at 5.30 ° with a corresponding d spacing of 16.67 Å , representing the inter-chain distance determined by these alkyl side chains. Another weak peak at 22.25 ° can be assigned to the π-π stacking between the polymer backbones. After PBDSe - DTBT was blended with PC71BM , the film processed without additives also displays a [100] peak at 5.32 ° , indicating relatively crystalline nature of polymers in this BHJ film. Interestingly , adding 1% DIO additive during the film processing induces a considerable decrease of this inter-chain spacing from 16.67 Å to 14.72 Å ( given the diffraction peak shifting from 5.30 ° to 6.0 ° ) , suggesting that the polymer chains are better packed along the inter-chain direction in the DIO-processed BHJ film. This increased structure order is also supported by the UV - vis absorption of the DIO-processed BHJ film(see supplementary Figure S3 ) , with a new pronounced absorption shoulder peak at ~ 659 nm.",

    "sentence": "59 Fitting the curves in Figure 6a yields a value of 1.15 for the n in the DIO processed device and 1.51 for the device processed without any additives. This result implies a reduced trap - assisted recombination in the DIO processed device , which can be associate with the improved molecular packing in this BHJ film , as discussed earlier. On the other hand , the dependence of J sc on light intensity can be plotted according to their relationship : J sc ∝ ( P light ) α ( Figure 6b ) , 55,58 where the value of the power law scaling exponent α indicates the strength of the bimolecular recombination. The closer the α approaches unity , the less bimolecular recombination. Indeed , a larger α ( 0.95 ) was 15 obtained for the DIO processed device than that of the device processed without additives ( 0.91 ) , indicating less bimolecular recombination loss in the DIO processed device. The reduced bimolecular recombination would lead to more charge carriers surviving the transport process and finally being extracted , 58 , 60^20 contributing to the higher J sc achieved in the DIO processed device , and the improved FF in all probed light intensities ( Figure 6c ). 17 Figure 6d plots the PCEs versus the light intensity , which shows a consistently higher PCE of the DIO processed device than that of the device processed without additives under 25 all light intensities . Aiming to integrate the unique features of angular - shaped \" donor \" moiety and Se heteroatom to obtain both a low optical band gap and a low - lying HOMO level in D-A copolymers , we designed and synthesized a novel D-A copolymer PBDSe - DTBT composed of angular - shaped \" donor \" moiety of benzo[2,1-b:3,4- PC71BM blends. After further device optimizations with various polymer : PCBM ratios , and using 1% DIO as the processing additive , the PCE of PBDSe - DTBT : PC71BM based BHJ devices could reach an impressive value of 5.6% , mainly due to a much improved J sc ( 12.30 mA cm^-2 ) and a dramatically enhanced FF ( 0.57 ) upon adding 1% DIO as the processing additive. The 1% DIO processed solar cells showed more balanced hole and electron transport and reduced charge recombination losses , which can be ascribed to closer intermolecular stacking of the polymers in BHJ films and better BHJ film morphology. Our 50 results demonstrate that angular - shaped benzo[2,1-b:3,4b']diselenophene ( BDSe ) is a promising building block for future design of highly efficient donor polymers for BHJ solar cells. Further molecular engineering of this interesting building block and related D-A polymers are therefore justified. 55 The authors are grateful to NSFC for funding through Grant ( 51073124 and 21031006 ) .",

The two copolymers exhibit good thermal stability , strong absorption in the visible region , and relatively lower HOMO energy level at ca. -5.10 eV. The hole mobilities of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz measured by SCLC method are 1.85 x 10^-3 and 1.77 x 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively. Power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymer solar cell ( PSC ) based on PDTSBTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) was 3.82% with J sc = 8.68 mA / cm^2 , V oc = 0.72 V , and FF = 0.611 , under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2.

Molecular weights and polydispersity indices ( PDIs ) of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration , and the results are listed in Table 1. The number - average molecular weights ( M n ) of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz are 9.1 and 8.6 K , respectively. Although the molecular weights are relatively low , they are higher than those of the corresponding thiophene - bridged D-A copolymers PDTSBTz 24a and PBDTBTz. 24b Thermal stability of the polymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure 1.

These copolymers ( PDTNBT , PDTNTBT , and PDTNTDPP ) were obtained via the Stille coupling reaction and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy , UV - vis absorption spectroscopy , cyclic voltammetry , and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ). Owing to the four solubilizing alkyl chains on the DTN unit , all the three copolymers have good solubility in common solvents. Among these polymers , PDTNTBT exhibits the highest space - charge limit current ( SCLC ) hole mobility of 2.13 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which is beneficial for achieving high performance solar cells. Under the simulated AM 1.5G illumination condition ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) , solar cells based on PDTNTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) exhibit a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 4.8% with a current density of 10.3 mA cm^-2 , an open - circuit voltage of 0.86 V , and a fill factor of 54% .

    "sentence": "In this work , we designed and synthesized a novel laddertype dithienonaphthalene ( DTN ) as a building block for p - type semiconductor copolymers.

The optical , electrochemical , and electrical properties of these polymers are Scheme 1. Synthesis of the New Ladder - Type DTN Monomer Scheme 2. Synthesis of New Ladder - Type DTN - Based Copolymers investigated together with their preliminary photovoltaic performance. Partially due to the donor - acceptor structure configuration , all three polymers exhibit lower band gaps compared to that of the most studied polymer P3HT. Both conventional and inverted solar cell devices are fabricated by using these conjugated polymers as donor materials and the PC71BM as the acceptor material. With the relatively higher hole mobility , the deeper - lying HOMO energy level , inverted devices based on PDTNTBT exhibit a higher PCE of 5.0% in comparison with those based on the other two copolymers . Synthesis. The synthetic routes for the copolymers and the monomer ( DTN ) are depicted in Schemes 1 and 2. The key intermediate , 2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,5-dicarboxylic acid ( 2 ) , was prepared according to a literature procedure. 18 Compound 2 was then esterified to get dimethyl-2,6dibromonaphthalene-1,5-dicarboxylate ( 3 ) in 93% yield. Stille coupling of compound 3 with tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane afforded compound 4. The two ester groups of compound 4 were hydrolyzed to afford a dicarboxylic acid derivative ( 5 ) , which was then converted to a dicarboxylic acid chloride by reacting with oxalyl chloride. Intramolecular Friedel - Crafts acylation of the dicarboxylic acid chloride regioselectively occurred at the 3-positions of the end - capped thiophenes to yield compound 6. By converting two carbonyl groups in compound 6 to the corresponding methylene groups by the Wolff - Kishner reduction , compound 7 was obtained. Alkylation of compound 7 with 2-ethylhexyl bromide afforded compound 8 in a yield of 40% . The DTN monomer was synthesized in 95% yield from compound 8 by lithium- hydrogen exchange reaction in the presence of n-butyllithium followed by a reaction with trimethyltin chloride. Stille coupling reactions between DTN , and 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione ( 9 ) , 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(hexyloxy)benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole ( 10 ) , and 4,7-dibromobenzo [c][1,2,5]thiadiazole ( 11 ) gave donor - acceptor copolymers PDTNTDPP , PDTNTBT , and PDTNBT , in that order. The number - average molecular weights ( M n ) and polydispersity indices ( PDIs ) of these polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the internal standard , and the results are listed in Table 1.",

    "sentence": "The molecular weights ( M n ) of PDTNTDPP , PDTNTBT , and PDTNBT are 6.8K , 12.1K , and 5.1K , respectively , with relatively narrow PDIs in the range of 1.3- 1.6 ( Table 1 ). We noticed that the molecular weights of these three polymers are not high due to the low purity of DTN during the polymerization. It should be noted that it is difficult to purify the liquid monomer DTN by the common purification methods such as recrystallization or column chromatography. The structures of the target polymers were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. All polymers show good solubility in common organic solvents , such as chloroform , toluene , chlorobenzene , and dichlorobenzene , due to the four 2-ethylhexyl chains in the ladder - type DTN repeat unit. Optical Properties. The absorption spectra of the target polymers in chlorobenzene solutions ( 1 × 10^-5 M ) and in thin films on glass substrates are shown in Figure 1 , and the data are summarized in Table 1. All the three copolymers exhibit one main broad absorption band in both dilute solutions and thin films. As shown in Figure 1a , the absorption maxima are 555 , 623 , and 711 nm for PDTNTBT , PDTNBT , and PDTNTDPP in chlorobenzene , respectively. In going from solution to solid state film ( Figure 1b ) , no significant differences are observed for the absorption spectra , except that there is a 20-30 nm redshifted absorption for the film. The electron - withdrawing properties of the acceptors have a strong effect on the absorption bands of the copolymers. The introduction of a strong acceptor with extended π-conjugation length ( such as TDPP ) into the DTN containing polymer backbone leads to a polymer with red - shifted absorption , and a weaker acceptor ( such as TBT ) leads to the polymer with blue - shifted absorption. The optical band gaps deduced from the onset of the thin film absorption spectra are in the following order : PDTNTDPP ( 1.50 eV ) < PDTNBT ( 1.72 eV ) < PDTNTBT ( 1.78 eV ). Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was used to investigate the electrochemical properties and estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the target polymers. Figure 2 shows the cyclic voltammetry of the polymer films on a Pt disk electrode in 0.1 mol / L Bu 4 NPF 6 acetonitrile solutions. Under this condition , the onset oxidation potential ( E 1 / 2 ox ) of ferrocence was -0.02 V versus Ag / Ag + . The CV curves were calibrated using ferrocence as the standard , whose HOMO energy level is set at -4.80 eV. 19 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the band gaps of the polymers were calculated according to the following equations , 20 and the data are listed in Table 1.",

Thus , the band gaps deduced from the difference of onset oxidation and reduction potentials are 1.75 , 1.94 , and 1.86 eV for PDTNTDPP , PDTNTBT , and PDTNBT , respectively. The HOMO energy levels ( Figure 3 ) were calculated to be -5.21 eV for PDTNTDPP , -5.36 eV for PDTNTBT , and -5.30 eV for PDTNBT , which are in good agreement with the ideal HOMO energy levels to ensure good air stability and high open circuit voltage ( V oc ) in polymer solar cells. 21 The LUMO levels are located at -3.46 eV for PDTNTDPP , -3.42 eV for PDTNTBT , and -3.44 eV for PDTNBT , which are much higher than that of PC71BM ( -4.3 eV ) to guarantee an energetically favorable electron transfer. Photovoltaic Properties and Hole Mobilities. Hole only devices ( ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au ) were fabricated in order to estimate the hole mobilities of these polymers by the space - charge limited current ( SCLC ) method. The J 0.5 versus V ap -V bi -V r plots of the polymer : PC71BM blended films are shown in the Supporting Information ( Figure S2 ). The SCLC hole mobilities of these polymers follow this trend : PDTNBT ( 2.07 × 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) < PDTNTDPP ( 2.44 × 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) < PDTNTBT ( 2.13 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). Obviously , as a donor material , PDTNTBT will have some advantages in the photovoltaic application compared to the other two polymers due to its much higher hole mobility. In order to investigate the potentials of these copolymers in photovoltaics , two sets of BHJ PSCs were fabricated with the device configurations of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / PIFB / Al and ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag , respectively. The copolymer : PC71BM blended films were prepared in a weight ratio of 1 : 3 using mixed solvents ( chlorobenzene:odichlorobenzene = 4 : 1 ) for the conventional solar cells , while the blend ratio was changed to 1 : 2 ( copolymer : PC71BM ) for the inverted devices. In fact , before the comparison on the performance of the optimized devices , we also fabricated the S1 and Figure S3 ).",

The V oc , short - circuit current ( J sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and PCE of the PSCs are summarized in Table 2. For the conventional devices , the PSC based on PDTNTDPP exhibited a V oc of 0.75 V , a J sc of 3.95 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 51.5% , resulting in a PCE of 1.52% . For PDTNBT , a significantly improved J sc of 6.82 mA / cm^2 and an increased V oc of 0.85 V were observed , although the FF decreased slightly compared to PDTNTDPP , all of which leads to an improved PCE of 2.79% . In the case of PDTNTBT , the PSC exhibits a higher PCE of 4.78% with a J sc of 10.29 mA / cm^2 , a V oc of 0.86 V , and an FF of 53.8% . Here , the much higher hole mobility of PDTNTBT : PC71BM blends and slightly deeper lying HOMO energy level of PDTNTBT lead to the higher efficiency of the PDTNTBT : PC71BM - based devices. Compared to conventional PSCs , inverted solar cell devices possess better long - term ambient stability because a more stable high work - function metal electrode is used and the acidic PEDOT : PSS layer is replaced by other stable anode buffer layers. 23,24 The inverted devices based on PDTNTDPP , PDTNBT , and PDTNTBT exhibit PCEs of 1.60% , 2.89% , and 4.82% , respectively , following a similar trend to the conventional devices. Notably , the PCEs of all inverted PSCs are slightly larger than their corresponding conventional devices. The improved efficiencies for the inverted devices are mainly due to the increased FFs ( 55.8% versus 50.2% for the PDTNTDPP system , 59.6% versus 53.8% for the PDTNTBT system , and 50.4% versus 48.1% for the PDTNBT system ).

However , PSCs based on PDTNTDPP and PDTNBT exhibit a broader spectral response range compared to those based on PDTNTBT , which is in agreement with the optical absorption spectra of their blended films with PC71BM in the same ratio ( Figure S1 ).",

    "sentence": "The EQE values of PSCs based on PDTNTBT are about 2-3 times higher than those based on the other two copolymers. Similar results were observed for the inverted devices based on polymer : PC71BM blends in the weight ratio of 1 : 2 ( Figure S4 ). Accordingly , PDTNTBT - based devices show a larger photocurrent and a higher overall PCE than the PDTNTDPP-or PDTNBT - based devices. At the same time , the higher hole mobility of the PDTNTBT blend also contributes to the higher EQE of the PSC based on it. Morphology and Device Stability Studies. For polymer solar cells , the morphological control of the BHJ active layer plays an important role in charge generation , separation , and transport , which could influence their device performance. In this work , the morphology of thin films was evaluated by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). The AFM topography ( left ) and phase ( right ) images are shown in Figure 6. The film of PDTNBT / PC71BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) showed clear phase separation with some aggregation and a relatively high surface roughness of 1.05 nm. The surface roughnesses of blended films based on PDTNTDPP and PDTNTBT based were 0.39 and 0.47 nm , respectively. Although with a smooth surface morphology of the active layer , the device based on PDTNTDPP has a low J sc value which can be attributed to its low mobility. And the blended film based on PDTNTBT is smooth and uniform as shown in the left of Figure 6b , which is beneficial for achieving high performance devices. In the phase image of the blended films , small phase separation domains of ∼ 15-20 nm size are clearly observed , which is an important prerequisite for efficient charge separation and transport. 25 Stability is very important for the real use of PSCs. Figure 7 shows the PCE of the inverted device based on PDTNTBT : PC71BM during a two month period. As shown in the figure , the inverted device has good performance with a PCE of 4.82% initially , and 10 days later , an increased PCE of 5.0% was achieved. After 60 days of storage in air , the device still exhibits a high PCE of 4.75% , which retains 95% of its highest efficiency. The excellent stability observed for the inverted PSCs based on PDTNTBT suggests a good potential of ladder - type DTN - based copolymers for photovoltaic applications. It should be noted that with a better encapsulation of the inverted device a further improvement in stability could be achieved . In summary , we have successfully designed and synthesized a novel ladder - type electron - rich unit ( DTN ) for constructing three donor - acceptor copolymers with tunable band gaps from 1.75 to 1.94 eV and variable HOMO levels from -5.36 to -5.21 eV.",

In addition , blends of PBTDTT-15 and PC71BM have achieved promising solar cell PCEs of up to 3.2% . 9b,c Considering the relatively narrow absorption spectrum of PBTDTT-15 , which has an absorption onset of around 640 nm , the OPV results suggest that the dialkyl-substituted DTT would be a promising building block for donor polymers. Combining the electron - donating DTT moiety with an electron - accepting moiety can create a novel push - pull type copolymer with a lower band - gap and better photonabsorption characteristics. Such a combination will also modulate the energy levels for further improvement in solar cell performances. Among various reported push - pull based materials , recently diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based molecules and polymers are gaining signicant attention in the research community due to their excellent properties such as high stability , weather fastness , large extinction coefficient , and electron - decient nature. 10 3,6-Dithien-2-yl-2,5-dialkylpyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione ( DTDPP ) is one of the important segments which was signicantly investigated for making an interesting class of DPP based materials for various applications including unipolar and ambipolar OFETs to OPVs. 11,12 In our study , we used a DTDPP unit as the acceptor block , and the dipentadecyl-substituted DTT unit as the donor segment. By combining DPP with DTT we expect to create a novel condensed aromatic push - pull conjugated backbone system with wide absorption spectrum and good charge transporting ability. Bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene was used as the bridging unit to link the dibrominated monomers of 3,6-bis(5bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-dialkylpyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione and 2,6-dibromo-3,5-dipentadecyl-dithieno[3,2-b ; 2^0 ,3 0 -d]thiophene through the Stille coupling polymerization. In contrast to most investigated donor - acceptor ( D-A ) type copolymers , which have been synthesized in alternating fashion , our copolymers are random by nature and the donor - acceptor blocks are incorporated randomly in the main conjugated backbone. This design strategy is benecial because of easy tailoring in the comonomer ( donor , acceptor or linking blocks ) feed ratio , which controls the optical and electronic properties of the copolymer. 17 In our previous communication , we reported a random D-A copolymer based on DPP and DTT moieties , which shows promising high power conversion eciency. 18 In this article a systematic exploration of the structure - property relationship was carried out on this type of random D-A copolymer. A series of copolymers PDPP-T-DTT have been consecutively designed and synthesized ( Scheme 1 ). The copolymers 1-3 with different ratios of dodecyl chain attached DPP to DTT moieties were rst prepared in this series and were found to have relatively poor solubility in common organic solvents , being soluble only in chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene. In spite of this , promising solar cell PCEs greater than 3% were achieved for these polymers ( vide infra ).",

    "sentence": "The best performance was offered by copolymer 2 which possesses balanced optical absorption from the UV to near IR region , thus we set out to improve the solubility and processability of this kind of polymer by replacing the straight dodecyl chain with branched alkyl chains such as 2ethylhexyl , 2-butyloctyl and 2-octyldodecyl , respectively. Polymers 4 to 6 which have different branched alkyl chains but the same comonomer feed ratio ( the same as copolymer 2 ) were synthesized and further evaluated in OPV devices. The best OPV performance was demonstrated by copolymer 5 , where a typical cell device of ITO / PEDOT - PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Ag , under simulated AM1.5 G conditions , exhibited V oc of 0.584 V , J sc of 12.76 mA cm^-1 , and FF of 67.27% , resulting in a PCE of 5.02% . Our systematic study has demonstrated that high OPV performance can be realized in randomly linked donor - acceptor copolymers. These results might open up new avenues to material chemists on the new molecular design for high performance OPV polymers . In order to determine the thermal properties of the copolymers , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetry ( TGA ) analyses of copolymers have been carried out. All of the copolymers exhibited excellent thermal stability with 5% weight loss temperatures between 370 and 420 °C ( Fig. 1 ). By comparing the 5% weight loss temperatures of copolymers 2 , 4 , 5 and 6 , in which the ratio between DPP and DTT moieties is the same but the alkyl chains attached to DPP are different , it can be observed that the thermal stability of the polymers decreased slightly as the bulk of the alkyl chains increased. DSC scans on the copolymers 1 to 4 revealed no clear thermal transitions from room temperature to 350 C. Copolymers 5 and 6 , however , had sharp melting peaks at 284 °C and 258 °C respectively ( Fig. 2 ) , indicating that the bulky branched alkyl chains on DPP impact not only on the polymer solubility but also the polymer chains packing in the solid state . The optical properties of the copolymers were studied by UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. The solution and thin lm absorption spectra for copolymers 1-6 are shown in Fig. 3. Two distinct absorption bands were observed , which can be attributed to the p-p* transition from DTT segments ( short wavelength region of 370-600 nm ) 9b and D-A charge - transfer transition ( long wavelength region of 600-910 nm ). The solution and lm spectra were similar , although the absorbance of all the polymers at the short wavelength region was relatively enhanced in the lm. When the ratio of the DTT units in the copolymers 1-3 was increased , absorbance in the short wavelength region increased relative to that of the long wavelength region.",

Active layers with thicknesses of around 120 nm were obtained by spincoating blend solutions. No thermal treatment was applied in the device fabrication process. The results are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. From the results , it can be seen that the highest PCE was 2.06% for copolymer 1 , 3.58% for copolymer 2 , and 3.06% for copolymer 3. The best ratio of polymer to PC61BM varied between the polymers , with copolymer 1 requiring a 1 : 4 ratio , copolymer 2 a 1 : 2 ratio and copolymer 3 a 1 : 1 ratio. For all 3 polymers , it was observed that an increase in the PC61BM content resulted in a slight decrease in the V oc . This has previously been observed for other donor polymers , such as MDMO - PPV , AFPO3 , P3HTV and PF10TBT. 22 The reduction in the V oc correlated with the decrease in the energy of the charge transfer ( CT ) states with increasing PC61BM concentrations. 22c It is observed that copolymer 2 ( m : n = 1 : 2 ) gave the best results among the three copolymers 1-3. Replacing PC61BM by PC71BM in the blend with copolymer 2 resulted in a device with J sc of 12.91 mA cm^-2 , V oc of 0.505 V , FF of 58.41% and PCE of 3.81% . The increase in PCE was due to an increase in the J sc ( 12.91 vs. 10.93 mA cm^-2 for the case of PC61BM ) , which can be attributed to the better absorption properties of PC71BM compared to PC61BM. 23 However , the general OPV performance does not improve much as we expect when compared to PBTDTT - 15. This is probably due to the poor solubility of three copolymers 1-3. Thus copolymers 4 , 5 and 6 were synthesized with different N-branched alkyl substituents ( 2-ethylhexyl , 2butyloctyl and 2-octyldodecyl respectively ) with the same 1 : 2 ratio in order to improve the processability of the polymer. It was observed that the solubility of copolymer 4 was similar to that of copolymer 2 and the solubilities of copolymers 5 and 6 were improved compared with copolymer 2. Copolymers 4 , 5 and 6 were tested in solar cells utilising a 1 : 2 weight ratio blend of polymer to PC71BM , and the results are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2. Comparing the performances of all the polymers in combination with PC61BM , it is observed that cells with copolymer 4 had a low PCE of 3.07% .",

    "sentence": "This could be attributed largely to a drop in the ll factor of the device , which we believe is due to reduced lm quality stemming from its poor solubility. Cells utilising copolymer 5 had a slightly higher J sc , V oc and FF than those of the copolymer 2 , resulting in an improved PCE of 4.39% . Furthermore , the substitution of PC71BM for PC61BM resulted in higher J sc values and improved PCE of 5.02% for copolymer 5. It is surprising that the performance of copolymer 6 in OPVs was much poorer although this polymer was much more soluble than their counterparts with shorter alkyl chains. Thus AFM studies ( Fig. 7 ) of the copolymer 5 : PC71BM and 6 : PC71BM devices were conducted to explore the cause of the poor performance for copolymer 6. It was observed that the domains in the copolymer 6 : PC71BM lm were 50-150 nm in size. Such large domain sizes are detrimental for charge separation as there is a greater likelihood of excitons recombining before they reach an interface where charge separation can take place. 24 The domains for the copolymer 5 : PC71BM lm were much smaller at around 20 nm , leading to much better charge separation and a higher short circuit current. Furthermore , for verifying the rationality of our strategy of donor - acceptor random copolymers for highly efficient organic photovoltaic applications , we intentionally prepared one donor - acceptor alternating copolymer based on DPP and DTT moieties ( copolymer 7 ) as shown in Scheme 1.^25 The bottomgate , top - contact thin lm transistor ( TFT ) devices were fabricated from copolymer 5 and copolymer 7 respectively in order to investigate how the donor - acceptor linkage style affects its charge transport properties. The two copolymers both showed p - type transporting characteristics and good current on / off ratios above 10^5 when measured in ambient conditions , the copolymer 7 presented much higher TFT performance over the copolymer 5 with saturation hole mobility of 0.11 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The hole mobility is at least one order of magnitude higher than that of copolymer 5 ( ca. 8.7 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) , 18 this is likely to be due to the random linkage of DTT donor and DPP acceptor units along the polymer backbone , which reduces the molecular ordering of copolymer 5 compared to the alternating - linked copolymer 7. The solar cell devices were fabricated using a blend of copolymer 7 and PC71BM with the same device structure as that for copolymer 5. Under the same measurement conditions , however , the devices with the 1 : 2 ratio by weight of copolymer 7 : PC71BM provided the highest PCE of 3.44% with V oc of 0.53 V , J sc of 9.91 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 65.65% , less than the OPV performance of copolymer 5.",
