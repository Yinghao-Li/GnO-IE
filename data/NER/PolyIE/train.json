Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted great attention due to their potential application as a low - cost and sustainable energy source. 1,2 Conjugated polymers which combine optoelectronic properties of semiconductors with processing advantages of polymers act as key component in the process of converting light into electricity. The optical and electronic characteristics of conjugated polymers are primarily governed by the polymer structures and inter-molecular interactions. [3][4][5][6] During the past decade , many conjugated polymers have been synthesized and studied as donor materials in bulk hetero - junction ( BHJ ) PSC devices. [7][8][9] The design rules for donor polymers in fullerene based BHJ devices have also been formulated. [10][11][12] Design and synthesis of new monomers may lead to polymers with tailor - made photo - physical and semiconducting properties for high performance solar cell applications. Recently , benzo[1,2b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) 13 , benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran ( BDF ) 14,15 and naphthodithiophene ( NDT ) [16][17][18][19][20] based conjugated polymers showed relatively high photovoltaic performances in PSC devices. One of the common structural features of these promising monomers is two heteroaromatic units fused with benzene or naphthalene to give extended π-conjugation and rigid planarity. The other common structural feature of the monomers is tactfully placing the required large solubilizing side - chains , such as alkoxy , alkyl and aryl on the middle of the ring - fused monomers to reducing the steric interaction between the consecutive repeating units in polymers. Rigid planar structure is good for extended π-conjugation and intermolecular packing. However , it usually results in poor solubility in materials. The good solubility of polymer is essential for solution processing. To improve polymer solubility , large solubilizing groups have to attach on the backbone of polymers. However , the side chains on the polymer backbone can result in steric interaction between adjacent repeating units. Placing large side - chains in the middle of rigidified aromatic structure can reduce the steric hindrance between consecutive repeating units , therefore , reducing dihedral 50 angles and achieving better conjugation in polymer. 21 Recently , Naphthodifurans ( NDFs ) as building blocks for small molecules and for polymers have been reported. [22][23][24] The conjugated polymers based on alkyl substituted ( β to the heteroatom ) NDF were also reported. 25,26 Herein , we reported a 55 new method for synthesis of a different NDF building block with solubilizing groups placed in the middle of ring - fused structure to reduce steric interaction between adjacent repeating units. A polymer based on this new NDF building block has also been synthesized.",

    "sentence": "The solar cell devices based on the polymer as donor 60 and PC61BM as acceptor achieved a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 5.22% without using any processing additives or postfabrication treatment. This is the highest performance in solar cell devices among all polymers based on NDF building blocks . Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) showed that the new polymer had good thermal stability with the onset point of decomposition ( the temperature of 5% weight - loss ) at 464 °C ( Fig. 1 ). Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) analysis of the polymers showed no apparent thermal transition for the polymers between 20 °C and 300 °C ( Fig. S11 † ) . The absorption spectra of PNDFT - DTBT in solution and as solid film are shown in Fig. 2. The PNDFT - DTBT showed dual 45 absorption profile of typical donor - acceptor type polymers in both solution and as thin film. The short wavelength peaks located at ca. 380 nm can be ascribed to the π-π* transition. The long wavelength peaks located at ca. 550-640 nm can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) interaction 50 between NDFT donor and DTBT acceptor. [3][4][5][6] The PNDFT - DTBT showed the main absorption peak at 576 nm with a molar extinction coefficient ( ε ) of 5.26 × 10^4 M -1 cm^-1 in chloroform solution ( 10^-5 mol L -1 ). The main absorption peak in thin - film spectrum was red - shifted ca. 50 nm compared to the peak in 55 solution spectrum. This bathochromic - shift indicated that the strong intermolecular interaction and aggregation occurred in solid - state of the polymers. 28 The optical bandgap of the polymer was calculated from the onset of thin - film absorption spectrum. It was 715 nm corresponding to a bandgap ( E g ) of 1.73 eV . The electrochemical properties of polymers were investigated by 65 cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). The cyclic voltammogram of PNDFT - DTBT is shown in Fig. 3. The potentials were referenced to the ferrocene / ferrocenium redox couple ( Fc / Fc + ). It was assumed that the redox potential of Fc / Fc + had an absolute energy level of -4.80 eV to vacuum. The potential of Fc / Fc + was measured under 70 Fig. 3 Cyclic voltammograms of polymer thin film. the same conditions and was located at 0.09 V related to the Ag / Ag + electrode. Both p-and n - doping processes were irreversible for the polymer , the onset oxidation ( p - doping ) was at 0.64 V and the onset reduction ( n - doping ) was at -1.27 V. According the equations : LUMO = e(E red + 4.71 ) ( eV ) and HOMO = e(E ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ) , [29][30][31] The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer were calculated to be -5.35 eV and -3.44 eV.",

    "sentence": "The relatively deep HOMO energy level of the polymer can be favourable for achieving high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) in PCS devices and also might benefit the stability of the polymer by avoiding unintentional p-doping. 15 The photovoltaic properties of the polymer were investigated in BHJ solar cell devices with the device structure of ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC61BM / MoO 3 / Al ( Table 1 and Fig. 4 ). The polymers were used as donor and PC61BM was used as acceptor. The active layer was processed with chlorobenzene ( CB ) and the concentration of donor material was 10 mg / mL. Solar cells were characterized under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm^-2 from a Newport solar simulator. The short - circuit current densities ( J sc ) of devices were significantly enhanced with the raising weight ratios of PC61BM to donor polymer ( Table 1 ). The fill factors ( FF ) of devices also increased with the raising of the ratios. However , the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) showed little change with change of the ratios. Solar cells based on PNDFT-DTBT:PC61BM ( 1 : 3 ) as the photoactive layer ( thickness of 85 nm ) exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 5.22% , a J sc of 8.21 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.89 V , and a high FF of 0.72. The PNDFT - DTBT achieved the highest performance in solar cell devices among all polymers based on NDF building blocks. The thermal annealing of the active layers resulted in dropping of photovoltaic performances. The adverse effect of annealing on photovoltaic performance could be ascribed to the macro-scale phase separation. The similar phenomenon has been reported on other poly(3-alkylthiophene ). 32 Addition of processing additive , diiodooctane ( DIO ) 33 before spin - coating did not show any improvement on device performances. Chloroform was also used as processing solvent. The devices processed with chloroform showed similar performances as devices processed with CB. from 300 to 700 nm and the highest EQE value of the devices exceeded 60% ( Fig. 4b ). The morphology of active layer plays an important role in the device performances. Proper morphology is necessary not only for exciton dissociation but also for charge transport to respective contacts. Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) 5 was used to investigate the morphology of polymer / PC BM active layer. Topography and phase images were taken from the film of polymer / PC61BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) blends casted from CB ( Fig. 5 ). The active layer showed good phase separation with a rootmean - square roughness ( RMS ) of 2.46 nm. 10 A new NDF building block ( NDFT ) has been designed and synthesized as building block for conjugated polymer. The new monomer was fully characterized and was applied in synthesis of conjugated polymer ( PNDFT - DTBT ).",

This rigid and coplanar IDTT building block was copolymerized with electron - deficient acceptors , 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( BT ) , 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( FBT ) and 1,3-dibromo-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) via Stille polymerization , respectively. Because the higher content of the thienothiophene moieties in the fully coplanar IDTT structure facilitates π-electron delocalization , these new polymers show much improved light - harvesting abilities and enhanced charge mobilities compared to PDITTBT copolymer using hexacyclic diindenothieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( DITT ) as the donor moieties. The device using PIDTTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) exhibited a decent power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.8% . Meanwhile , the solar cell using PIDTTFBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 in wt % ) blend exhibited a greater V oc value of 0.9 V and a larger J sc of 10.08 mA / cm^2 , improving the PCE to 4.2% . The enhanced V oc is attributed to the lower - lying of HOMO energy level of PIDTTFBT as a result of fluorine withdrawing effect on the BT unit. A highest PCE of 4.3% was achieved for the device incorporating PIDTTTPD : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 in wt % ) blend . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) using organic p - type ( donor ) and ntype ( acceptor ) semiconductors have attracted tremendous scientific and industrial interest. 1 The most critical challenge at molecular level is to develop p - type conjugated polymers that can simultaneously possess sufficient solubility for processability and miscibility with an n - type material , low band gap ( LBG ) for strong and broad absorption spectrum to capture more solar photons , and high hole mobility for efficient charge transport. 2 The most useful approach to make a LBG polymer is to connect electron - rich donor and electron - deficient acceptor segments along the conjugated polymer backbone. Thiophene and benzene aromatic rings are the most important ingredients to comprise p - type conjugated polymers. Benzenebased derivatives such as tricyclic 2,7-fluorene or 2,7-carbazole units have shown to serve as useful building blocks to construct donor - acceptor polymers having deep - lying HOMO energy levels that contribute to achieve high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) ( > 0.8 V ) for PSCs. 3 However , the intrinsic drawback is that these polymers usually possess relatively large optical band gaps ( > 2 eV ) that limit their ability to harvest sunlight and thus result in moderate short - circuit current ( J sc ). On the other hand , because of the lower aromaticity to adapt more quinoidal resonance structure , thiophene - based D-A polymers have better light absorption ability to permit greater J sc .",

    "sentence": "However , their V oc values are generally limited to ca. 0.6 V as a result of the high - lying HOMO levels. 4 Thieno [3,2-b]thiophene ( TT ) unit emerges as a superior thiophene - based building block to achieve high mobility p - type semiconductors. 5 This compact structure actually possesses higher aromatic stabilization energy than a thiophene , which can potentially lower the HOMO level for higher V oc . 6 Moreover , the C 2h symmetry and coplanar geometry may promote more ordered packing and stronger interchain interactions to obtain exceptional hole mobility , which is beneficial for J sc . 7 Introducing the alkyl chains into the two β-positions of thieno [3,2-b]thiophene unit is usually necessary to improve the solubility of the resulting polymers. Unfortunately , these side chains inevitably impose a negative effect on the effective conjugation due to severe steric hindrance - induced twisting between the neighboring aryls. 8 By implementing forced planarization via covalently fastening adjacent aromatic units in the polymer backbone , advantageous intrinsic properties such as reduced band gap and enhanced charge mobility can be retained. 9 Therefore , it is of interest to integrate benzene and thieno [3,2-b]thiophene units into a molecular entity with forced rigidification to simultaneously extend the conjugation while maintaining the coplanarity. However , development of ladder - type architectures requires elegant molecular design and synthesis. 10 Recently , we first reported a multifused hexacyclic diindenothieno [3,2-b]thiophene ( DITT ) unit , where the central TT ring is connected with two outer phenyl rings through two embedded cyclopentadienyl ( CP ) rings ( Scheme 1 ). 11 This electron - rich unit was copolymerized with electron - deficient benzothiadiazole acceptor to obtain a donor - acceptor copolymer PDITTBT ( Scheme 1 ). Nevertheless , this polymer is short of absorption coverage at the visible and near IR region due to the fact that DITT possesses high content of high - aromaticity benzene rings ( two benzene rings and one thieno [3,2-b]thiophene ) , leading to relatively large optical band gap and thus limited photocurrent. By reversing the arrangement of TT and benzene units in the DITT framework , we present here a new multifused heptacyclic structure , indacenodithieno[3,2-b]-thiophene ( IDTT ) , where the central phenylene ring is fused with two outer TT rings by two carbon bridges. Compared to hexacyclic DITT unit , this heptacyclic IDTT has extended conjugation length with greatly increasing the content of the thiophene moieties ( one benzene and two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units ). Furthermore , the placement of the thienothiophene units at the two terminal sides of IDTT is advantageous for facile α-bromination or stannylation for subsequent polymerization. Four side chains introduced at the bridging carbons in IDTT guarantee solubility without twisting the coplanarity. Meanwhile , exploitation of suitable electrondeficient acceptors in combination with IDTT donor in the polymeric backbone is required. Benzothiadiazole ( BT ) 12 and thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) 13 are the widely used electron - deficient acceptors due to their suitable electron affinity and easy availability.",

    "sentence": "5,6-Difluorobenzothiadiazole ( FBT ) unit with two fluorine atoms on BT unit also emerges as a superior derivative for adjusting the molecular properties. 14 In this research , we report the detailed synthesis of the distannyl-IDTT monomer which was copolymerized with BT , FBT , TPD acceptor moieties to prepare a new class of D-A alternating IDTT - based copolymers ( Scheme 1 ). Their thermal , optical and electrochemical properties have been carefully characterized. Preliminary results showed that the IDTT - based polymers are promising for photovoltaic solar cell applications. Synthesis. The synthetic route for Sn-IDTT monomer is depicted in Scheme 2. Stille coupling of diethyl 2,5dibromoterephthate with 2-(tributylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene yielded compound 1. Double nucleophilic addition of the ester groups in 1 by (4-octyloxy)phenyl magnesium bromide led to the formation of benzylic alcohols in 2 which was subjected to intramolecular Friedel - Crafts cyclization under acidic condition to furnish the heptacyclic IDTT arene in a good yield of 81% . Bromination of IDTT by Nbromosuccinimide generated Br - IDTT in a high yield of 87% . Finally , Br - IDTT was lithiated by n-butyllithium followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride to afford the distannyl Sn-IDTT in a moderate yield of 54% . Sn-IDTT monomer was copolymerized with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( BT ) , 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( FBT ) and 1,3-dibromo-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) acceptor monomers via Stille coupling to afford three donor - acceptor copolymers , poly(indacenodithieno [3,2-b]thiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole ) ( PIDTTBT , M n = 16.6 kDa , PDI = 1.7 ) , poly ( indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-alt-difluorobenzothiadiazole ) ( PIDTTFBT , M n = 24.0 kDa , PDI = 1.2 ) and poly ( indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-alt-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ) ( PIDTTTPD , M n = 31.3 kDa , PDI = 2.0 ) , respectively ( Scheme 3 ). These copolymers purified by successive Soxhlet extraction and precipitation showed narrower molecular weight. The resulting copolymers flanked with four side chains on IDTT unit possess excellent solubilities in common organic solvents , such as chloroform , toluene , and THF. Thermal and Optical Properties. The thermal stability of the polymers was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ). PIDTTBT , PIDTTFBT , and PIDTTTPD exhibited sufficiently high decomposition temperatures ( T d ) of 414 , 391 , and 384 °C , respectively. UV - vis absorption spectra of the three polymers in THF solutions and in thin films are shown in Figure 1 and the correlated optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. PIDTTBT and PIDTTFBT showed two obvious absorption bands in the spectra. The longer wavelength absorbance is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the electron - rich and the electron - deficient segments. However , the localized transition bands and ICT bands of PIDTTTPD overlap into a broad band covering the whole visible region from 400 to 700 nm , indicating that the accepting strength of TPD is weaker than that of BT unit.",

    "sentence": "The absorption spectra of the three polymers shift toward longer wavelengths from the solution state to the solid state , indicating that the coplanar structure of IDTT is capable of inducing strong interchain interactions. The optical band gaps ( E g opt ) deduced from the onset of absorption in the solid state are determined to be 1.69 eV for PIDTTBT , 1.77 eV for PIDTTFBT and 1.95 eV for PIDTTTPD. Note that the optical band gap of PDITTBT is 2.15 eV , which is significantly larger than that of PIDTTBT , suggesting that the heptacyclic IDTT unit with higher content of thienothiophene moieties indeed facilitates the π-electron delocalization compared to the hexacyclic DITT unit. Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to examine the electrochemical properties and determine the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energies of the polymers ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ). The three polymers showed stable and reversible p - doping and n - doping processes , which are important prerequisites for p - type semiconductor materials. The LUMO energy levels of PIDTTBT , PIDTTFBT , and PIDTTTPD are determined to be -3.40 , -3.50 , and -3.18 eV , respectively. The LUMO energy levels are higher than that of the PC71BM acceptor ( -3.8 eV ) to ensure energetically favorable electron transfer. It should be noted that the HOMO energy of PIDTTFBT ( -5.30 eV ) is lower than that of PIDTTBT ( -5.43 eV ) due to the two electron - withdrawing fluorine atoms on the BT units. 14 Furthermore , PIDTTTPD shows the lowest HOMO energy level of -5.45 eV , indicating that TPD acceptor unit is also capable of lowering the HOMO energy level of the resulting polymer. The HOMO energy levels are within the ideal range to ensure better air - stability and greater attainable V oc . Theoretical Calculations. In order to gain more insight into the molecular orbital properties of the polyaromatic πelectron systems , quantum - chemical calculations were performed with the Gaussian09 suite employing the B3LYP and TD-B3LYP density functionals in combination with the 6-311G ( d,p ) electronic properties , all the side - chain substituents were replaced with methyl groups for simplicity. Repeating units , denoted as IDTTBT , IDTTFBT , and IDTTTPD , in their most stable conformations were used as simplified model compounds for PIDTTBT , PIDTTFBT , and PIDTTTPD , respectively. The calculated HOMO / LUMO energy , excitation energy , oscillator strength , and configurations of the excited states are summarized in Table 2 and the frontier orbitals , HOMO ( H ) , LUMO ( L ) and the closeby LUMO+1 ( L+1 ) are illustrated in Table 3. The HOMO electron density distribution of IDTTTPD is analogous to that of IDTTFBT and IDTTBT , where the electron density is not only distributed homogeneously along the molecular backbone of the IDTT moiety but also on parts of the acceptor.",

    "sentence": "Given that the contribution of the IDTT moiety to the HOMO energy level should be similar among the three compounds , the difference in the HOMO energy level therefore mainly depends on the nature of the acceptors. Consistent with the electrochemical experiments , the calculated HOMO energy levels of the three model compounds follow the order : IDTTTPD ( -5.25 eV ) < IDTTFBT ( -5.23 eV ) < IDTTBT ( -5.18 eV ). On the contrary , the LUMO of IDTTTPD is higher in energy than that of IDTTFBT and IDTTBT. IDTTFBT and IDTTBT have similar LUMO electron density patterns of which the electron density is mainly located on the acceptors ( BT and FBT ). Instead , the electron density of LUMO in IDTTTPD is not only localized on TPD unit but span from TPD to IDTT moieties. Involvement of the IDTT orbitals in the LUMO of IDTTTPD may result in a high - lying energy level of LUMO. As listed in Table 2 , although there are variations in the absolute values , the calculated absorptions are still in good agreement with the experimental values. In order to have further understanding of these electronic transitions , electron density difference maps ( EDDMs ) were conducted ( Figure 3 ). 15 The electronic transitions can therefore be visualized through EDDMs. Red indicates a decrease in charge density , while green indicates an increase. For IDTTBT , the lowest energy singlet electronic transition ( λ calc = 597 nm ; λ max,exp = 622 nm ) indicates a pronounced intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) from IDTT to BT. The transitions at λ calc = 433 and 430 nm are close in energy and may not be separable. In fact , in the UV absorption spectrum , only one absorption peak ( λ max,exp = 420 nm ) was observed. On the basis of the EDDMs , both transitions belong to charge separations from the molecular backbone of IDTT and one 4-methoxyphenyl side chain to the BT unit. The lowest energy singlet electronic transition ( λ calc = 607 nm ; λ max,exp = 616 nm ) of IDTTFBT is a ICT band , which is basically caused by the electron transfer from IDTT to FBT. The transitions at λ calc = 435 and 431 nm are also inseparable in the experimental spectrum ( λ max,exp = 415 nm ). One at λ calc = 435 nm is assigned to the ICT from the flanking 4methoxyphenyl groups of IDTT to BT , and the other one at λ max = 431 nm only occurs at localized regions. Lastly , the most probable vertical excitation of IDTTTPD is calculated to be 521 nm , which deviates slightly from the λ max,exp of 589 nm. It mainly results from the ICT from IDTT to TDP and the π-π* transition within the IDTT unit has a minor contribution. Organic Field Effect Transistors.",

    "sentence": "To investigate the mobilities of the polymers , organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) were fabricated in the bottom - contact / top - contact geometry as described in the Experimental Section ( Table 4 and Figure 4 ). The hole mobilities were deduced from the transfer characteristics of the devices in the saturation regime. The polymers - based OFETs using SiO 2 as gate dielectric was treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane ( ODTS ) to form a selfassembly monolayer ( SAM ). With the modification of a ODTS - SAM layer along with annealing temperature at 150 and 200 °C , the hole mobilities of the three polymers were determined to be 7 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , 1 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , and 1 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with the on - off ratios of 1.9 × 10^3 , 1.4 × 10^7 , and 3.2 × 10^4 for PIDTTBT , PIDTTFBT , and PIDTTTPD devices , respectively. It should be mentioned that PDITTBT using hexacyclic DITT as the donor showed a much lower mobility of 7 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . 11 This result again indicates that higher content of thienothiophene unit can improve the charge transporting properties. Photovoltaic Characteristics. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells were fabricated by spin - coating the blends from odichlorobenzene solutions at various polymer - to - PC71BM ratios on the basis of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al configuration and their performances were measured under a simulated AM 1.5 G illumination of 100 mW / cm^2. The asymmetric PC71BM was used due to its stronger light absorption in the visible region than that of PC61BM. The characterization data are summarized in Table 5 and the J-V curves of these polymers are shown in Figure 5. The blend ratio of the active layers shown in the Table 5 is the result of the optimized conditions for the devices. The device based on the PIDTTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 in wt % ) blend exhibited a V oc of 0.84 V , a J sc of 8.32 mA / cm^2 , a FF of 55% , delivering a decent PCE of 3.8% . It is noteworthy that the device based on PDITTBT polymer using the hexacyclic DITT unit as the donor only exhibited a lower V oc of 0.88 V , a J sc of 7.46 mA / cm^2 , resulting in a lower PCE of 2.7% . 11 Meanwhile , the device using PIDTTFBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 in wt % ) blend exhibited a greater V oc value of 0.9 V and a larger J sc of 10.08 mA / cm^2 with an improved PCE to 4.2% . The enhanced V oc is attributed to the lower - lying of HOMO energy level of PIDTTFBT as a result of fluorine withdrawing effect on the FBT unit.",

Even though the device derived from PIDTTFBT has the highest V oc and J sc , it does not show a better PCE than the PIDTTTPD - based device , which is due to the fact that the device of PIDTTTPD has a much larger FF than that of PIDTTBT. To confirm the accuracy of the measurements of the devices , the corresponding external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra were measured under illumination of monochromatic light ( Figure 4 ). The J sc values calculated from integration of the EQE spectra agree well with the J sc obtained from the J-V measurements . Compared to thiophene unit , C 2h -symmetry thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( TT ) unit with higher aromatic stabilization energy and coplanar geometry is a promising building block for donor - acceptor conjugated polymers to obtain higher V oc and J sc . However , introducing aliphatic side chains on the βpositions of TT units leads to severe steric hindrance - induced twisting between the neighboring aryls in the polymer backbone. A straightforward approach to circumvent this deficiency is to embed TT units in a multifused ladder - type structure. A hexacyclic diindenothieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( DITT ) unit has been first developed. Nevertheless , DITT possesses high content of high - aromaticity benzene rings resulting in relatively large optical band gap and thus limited J sc . By reversing the arrangement of TT and benzene units in the DITT framework , we have successfully developed a new multifused heptacyclic structure , indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( IDTT ) , where the central phenylene ring is fused with two outer TT rings. The ladder - type IDTT framework can be easily constructed by Friedel - Crafts annulation. The optical and electrochemical properties of the resulting polymers have been characterized experimentally and theoretically. Compared to the hexacyclic DITT unit , this heptacyclic IDTT has extended conjugation length with significantly increasing the content of the thiophene moieties. Because of the more favorable π-electron delocalization , IDTT - based polymers show much improved light - harvesting abilities and enhanced charge mobilities. The device using PIDTTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) blend exhibited an improved efficiency of 3.8% .

    "sentence": "A novel donor - acceptor ( D-A ) copolymer ( P3TBDTDTBT ) , including hyperconjugated side chained benzodithiophene as donor and 4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) as acceptor , was designed and synthesized. Due to the introduce of hyperconjugated side chain , the resulted polymer exhibited good thermal stability with a high decomposition temperature of 437 °C , low band - gap of 1.67eV with an absorption onset of 742 nm in solid film , and a deep highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) energy level of -5.26eV. Finally , the polymer solar cells ( PSC ) device based on this polymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) showed a best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.57% with an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.78 V , a short - circuit current density ( Jsc ) of 8.83 mA / cm^2 and a fill factor ( FF ) of 53% . Polymer solar cells ( PSC ) have recently attracted significant attention as the most promising technique due to their potential advantages , such as lightweight , flexible nature and cost - effective manufacturing process. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] As a research focus in both industry and academia , the development of PSC has achieved significant progress recently and a large amount of polymers with high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6-9 % have been developed. [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] In PSC , the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) devices structure has been proven to be the most successful structure , 15 where the active layer is consisted of a nanoscale bicontinuous phase - separated conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives. The molecular design of new conjugated polymers is one of the most important , though challenging topics. Most efforts have been focused on conjugated polymers with alternating electron - rich ( Donor ) and electron - deficient ( Acceptor ) units , known as D-A structured polymers. [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] As the donor unit , benzodithiophene ( BDT ) unit has a symmetric and planar conjugated structure , which can easily realize ordered π-π stacking with a large domain size. Since Hou and Yang reported primarily the synthesis and electronic properties of BDT - based copolymers with alkoxy substituent in 2008 , 24 the BDT unit has become one of the most employed donor moieties for polymers in PSC. [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] However , in addition to the planar backbone , the BDT core offers the flexibility of attaching different substitutes on the central benzene core to fine - tune the energy level of the polymer. In 2010 , Yang group synthesized a donor - acceptor polymer ( PBDTTBT ) containing an alkyl substituted thienyl side chained BDT on the copolymer backbone , and the polymer based solar cells exhibited a 5.66% PCE which is one of the highest values at that time.",

    "sentence": "34 Then the use of conjugated side chain has been demonstrated to both enhance the solubility of the copolymer and contribute to extending the π-conjugation from the backbone to the lateral substituents , leading to two - dimensional or 2D π-conjugated systems. [35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46] Thiophene - based π-conjugated side chains , with the high electronic density and strong tendency to aggregate , are particularly suitable for the described purposes. For example , Huo et al. 11 have attached different substituents , alkoxy and alkylthienyl , to the benzene core of BDT and exploited the properties of corresponding polymers. The results show that replacing the alkoxy with alkylthienyl substituents on the BDT core increases the thermal stability , gives broader absorption spectra , lowers the highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbit ( LUMO ) energy levels , and overall enhances the photovoltaic properties ( PCE up to 7% ) of the polymers. In 2012 , the Mihaela C. Stefan group extended the π-conjugation of the side chain from a single thiophene unit to two thiophenes , and reported the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of two donor - acceptor polymers containing 3,3′,5-trihexylbithienyl substituted benzodithiophene and benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole or 5-hexylthieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as donor and acceptor. The resulted polymers exhibited good solubility and high V oc values up to 1.04 V because of the low HOMO energy level but moderate Jsc of 5.36 mA / cm^2 and FF of 47% . 47 In this paper , we further extended the π-conjugation by attaching a hyperconjugated side chain to the BDT unit and synthesized the polymer P3TBDTDTBT. In this polymer , four dodecyl chains were selected to guarantee that high molecular weight polymer would be soluble in organic solvents and no side - chained DTBT was chosen to lower the band - gap and reduce the steric repulsion between the adjacent monomer units , which would assist the polymer backbone to adopt a more planar conformation. The polymer exhibited a high decomposition temperature of 437 °C , a broad absorption in the range of 300-742 nm , and a low - lying HOMO energy level of -5.26eV. The Polymer Chemistry Accepted Manuscript best PSC device based on this polymer and PCBM showed a PCE of 3.57% with a V oc of 0.78 V , a Jsc of 8.83 mA / cm^2 and a FF of 52% . The thermal properties of the polymer P3TBDTDTBT was measured by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ). Seen from Fig. 1 , TGA indicates that P3TBDTDTBT exhibits high thermal stability and the decomposition temperature ( T d ) at 5% weight loss is about 437 ° C. This high decomposition temperature prevents the deformation of the polymer morphology and the degradation of the polymeric active layer under applied electric fields in solar cell devices. DSC reveals that there is no obvious glass transition for the polymer before 437 °C .",

    "sentence": "Fig. 2 shows the normalized UV - vis absorption spectra of P3TBDTDTBT in dilute chloroform solution and in thin solid film. The absorption peak wavelength ( λ max ) is 628 and 656 nm in solution and thin film , while the absorption onset wavelength ( λ onset ) is 730 and 742nm. The polymer shows broad absorption from 300 to 742 nm , covering the whole visible spectrum , with two distinct absorption bands at around 392 and 628 nm in solution. The peak at 392 nm is corresponding to the π-π* transition of the conjugated polymer backbone and the peak at 628 nm is attributed to a strong intermolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the electron - donating BDT and the electron - accepting DTBT units in the main chain. In the solid film , the absorption spectra become broader and show a 28 nm red - shift in comparison with their solution absorption , which indicates planar polymer chain structure and effective interchain π-π stacking in the solid state. Very interestingly , the solid absorption spectra demonstrate a more pronounced shoulder peak at Page 9 of 28 Polymer Chemistry approximately 615 nm , which can be attributed to the slightly increased interchain π-π stacking and extension of the conjugation of two dimensional structures in the solid state 49 . The optical band - gap of P3TBDTDTBT is 1.67eV determined from the onset of the UV - vis absorption in thin solid film . Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was performed to investigate the redox behavior of the polymer and also to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer 50 . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined by measuring the onset oxidation potential ( E onset ox ) and reduction potential ( E onset re ) of the polymer film. To obtain the oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymer film , the reference electrode was calibrated using ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) , which had a redox potential with an absolute energy level of -4.80eV in vacuum ; the potential of this external standard under the same conditions was 0.44 V versus Ag / Ag + . As shown in Fig. 3 , the polymer showed an E onset ox at 0.90 V and an E onset re at -0.80V. Accordingly , the HOMO and LUMO energy values ( E HOMO and E LUMO ) were calculated using the following equation : 50 The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated to be -5.26eV and -3.56eV. The energy band - gap calculated from the HOMO and LUMO energy levels is 1.70eV which is consistent with the optical band - gap ( 1.67eV ) estimated from absorption onset in thin solid film. E HOMO = -(E onset ox +4.36)eV ; E LUMO = -(E onset re +4.36)eV . The bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using the resulted polymer as the donor and PCBM as the acceptor to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the polymer.",

Replacing the carbon atom in the side chain of polymer PBDTQS with a thiophene ring could increase the conjugation length and improve the absorption in the visible region of the copolymer PBDTQTS and PTQTS. Furthermore , polymer PTQTS exhibited a more planar backbone and increased intermolecular π-stacking compared to PBDTQTS , which was because the thiophene unit in PTQTS had smaller size and less steric hindrance than those of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']-dithiophene unit in PBDTQTS. For the optimized polymer solar cell of PTQTS : PC61BM , PCE of 3.73% with V oc of 0.76 V , J sc of 9.41 mA cm^-2 and FF of 52.33% under an AM 1.5 G solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm^-2 was achieved , which was the best performance among the three copolymers. The results implied that the PTQTS with thiophene as the donor unit and QTS as the acceptor unit in the main chain would be a promising donor candidate in the application of polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on the bulk hetero - junction ( BHJ ) active layers of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives have attracted significant attention due to their light weight , low cost , and flexibility. [1][2][3][4] To obtain donor materials with ideal performance , tremendous efforts have been devoted to tuning their properties through molecular designs. [5][6][7][8] The key issue in the studies of PSCs is to increase power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of the devices. Recently , PCEs of the BHJ PSCs have acquired significant improvement due to the development of new polymers with low band gap via intra-molecular charge - transfer ( ICT ) donor (D)-acceptor ( A ) strategy. [9][10][11] Numerous conjugated polymers have been developed and various chemical modifications have been used to optimize the physical and photovoltaic properties of the D-A polymers. [12][13][14][15][16] PCE has exceeded 9% for single junction solar cells 17,18 and 10% for tandem solar cells. 19,20 It is still very challenging to simultaneously balance the absorptions , energy levels , and charge mobilities of PSCs for linear D-A conjugated polymers. In recent years , side chain conjugated polymers , which had the donor or acceptor building block with conjugated structure in the side chain directions , are attracting attention for modulating the electronic structures of polymers. [21][22][23][24][25] Based on this strategy , Hou et al. have successfully proven the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (BDT)-polymers with conjugated structure in the side chain directions show higher hole transport property and photovoltaic performance. 26 In addition , some acceptor building blocks , with conjugated side chain have also been reported.",

    "sentence": "27 For example , a prospecting conjugated polymer poly[2,3-bis-(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline-alt-thiophene] ( TQ ) exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 6.0% , opencircuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.89 V , short - circuit current ( J sc ) of 10.5 mA cm^-2 and fill factor ( FF ) of 64% . 28 The two substituted benzene groups on the quinoxaline rings could freely rotate , thus potentially hinder the intermolecular packing and further influence charge carrier mobility of the copolymers. Therefore , some groups designed new quinoxaline derivatives by replacing a phenyl group with a thiophene moiety , 29,30 which may further improve the absorption capability of the donor materials. Moreover , it is important to improve the packing orders of the D-A conjugated polymer because the mobility of the polymer film is highly related to the inter-chain π-π stacking of the polymers. Considering the donor - acceptor interaction and the spatial steric hindrance caused by the branched alkyl chains , it could be better that the small donor units dock into the cavity of large acceptor cores. 31 This \" molecular docking \" strategy would reduce the steric hindrance of side chains and increase the inter-chain π-π stacking of the polymer , and improve the carrier mobility of the active layer in devices. Pei 's group has introduced a \" molecular docking \" strategy and demonstrated that polymer symmetry and backbone curvature affect the inter-chain of isoindigo - based polymers in film , ultimately leading to improved device performance. 32 Based on the above considerations , a delicate balance between the steric hindrance and conjugated length is needed via judiciously designed polymers. For example , it is well known that increasing the length of the side chains will enhance the steric hindrance , thus increase the solubility of the polymer , which may further lead to better film processability. 33 However , it is also obvious that too much steric hindrance will force the backbone of the polymer to bend out of coplanarity , which may influence the mobility and light - harvesting ability of the active layer. 34 In the case of conjugated length , a similar problem exists. Large conjugated length will enhance the π-π stacking and decrease the band gap of the polymers , which would surely increase the mobility and light harvesting - ability of the active layer. 35 However , if the conjugated length is significantly large , the solubility and film processability of the polymers will be influenced , which may further affect the morphology of the active layer. 36 In this context , we tried to improve the photovoltaic performance of quinoxaline - based conjugated polymer from the view of both conjugated length in the side chain direction and steric hindrance of building blocks. Firstly , we introduced an alkylthio substitute on the quinoxaline and synthesized a new low band gap conjugated polymer poly{4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-alt-2,3-bis(n-octylthiomethyl)qui-noxaline} ( PBDTQS ). To our knowledge , a quinoxaline segment containing an alkylthio substitute group has not been reported.",

    "sentence": "Sulfur atom has some π-acceptor capability due to the formation of p π (C)-d π ( S ) orbital overlap , where divalent sulfur accepts π-electron from the p-orbital of carbon-carbon double bond into its empty 3 d -orbitals. 37,38 This causes the polymers containing alkylthio side chain to exhibit unique optoelectronic properties such as broader absorption spectra 39 and lower the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level. 40,41 In our strategy , the incorporation of alkylthio side chain into quinoxaline monomers may be a promising method to down - shift the HOMO energy level to certain extent. 10 To increase the conjugated length in the side chain direction , we replaced a carbon atom with a thiophene unit and synthesized another copolymer , namely , poly{4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-alt-2,3-bis-[(5-octylthio)thiophen-2-yl]quinoxaline} ( PBDTQTS ). In our design strategy , the advantage of the alkylthio side chain and the thiophene ring in the quinoxaline are expected to be combined , which would result in the improvement of light - harvest ability and lower the HOMO energy levels of the target polymers. To further improve the performance of our polymer , we changed the BDT donor unit to a simple and small thiophene unit and synthesized the poly{2,3-bis[(5-octylthio)thiophen-2-yl]quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl}(PTQTS) ( Scheme 1 ) , which could decrease the steric hindrance and increase the inter-chain π-π stacking of polymer backbones. The UV - vis absorptions , energy levels , morphology and photovoltaic performances of the abovementioned three copolymers were evaluated to understand the relationships between their structures and properties. Using the conventional device structure , the polymer PTQTS displayed a promising PCE of 3.73% with V oc of 0.76 V , J sc of 9.41 mA cm^-2 , FF of 52.3% under the illumination of AM 1.5 G^100 mW cm^-2 without post-treatment , which was the best performance among the three copolymers because of its good planar and high hole mobility. The results indicated that the polymer PTQTS with thiophene as the donor unit and Scheme 1 Synthetic route for the monomers and polymers. QTS as the acceptor unit in the main chain , was a promising donor candidate in the application of polymer solar cells . The thermal properties of PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS were analyzed by thermo - gravimetric analysis ( TGA ). The degradation temperature ( T d ) ( with 5% weight lost ) was found to be at 304 , 370 and 320 °C for PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS , respectively ( as shown in Fig. 1 ). Obviously , the thermal stabi - lity of these quinoxaline - based polymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices . The UV - vis absorption properties of the obtained copolymers were measured in both chloroform solution ( Fig. 2a ) and as thin films on quartz slides ( Fig. 2b ). As shown in Fig. 2 , all the resulting copolymers had similar absorption profiles and showed two absorption peaks at around 380 and 600 nm , which is a typical feature for D-A copolymers.",

    "sentence": "The absorption peak around 380-410 nm originated from the π-π* transition of the polymer main chain , and the absorption in the wavelength range of 500-800 nm were mainly due to the charge transfer from the donor units to acceptor units. In comparison with PBDTQS , the maximum absorption peaks of PBDTQTS and PTQTS in the long wavelength range were obviously redshifted , suggesting that thiophene unit could increase the conjugated length in the backbone of the copolymers. A Similar behavior was observed for the absorption spectra of these copolymers as thin solid films ( Fig. 2b ). Compared to the absorption peaks in solution , the absorption peaks of the films in the wavelength range of 500-800 nm showed larger red - shifts around 25 , 8 , 51 nm for PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS , respectively. The reason could be explained by the formation of π-stacked structures in the solid state which could facilitate charge transportation for photovoltaic applications. Moreover , it also indicated that PTQTS possessed stronger π-stacking ability than the other two copolymers in solid state due to the small thiophene unit , which could decrease the steric hindrance of building blocks and improve the interchain π-π stacking. The optical band gaps calculated from the onset of the film absorption spectra were about 1.77 , 1.70 and 1.58 eV for PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS , respectively. It is worth noting that the E opt g of PTQTS was considerably lower than those of PBDTQS and PBDTQTS , which would facilitate a high absorption in green - red region of the solar spectrum. Thus , PSCs based on PTQTS and PC61BM probably exhibited a better J sc value and photovoltaic performance than that of other two polymers . To investigate the differences in electrochemical properties , the redox potentials of PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS films deposited onto a platinum electrode were studied by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurement. The HOMO and LUMO levels of polymers were calculated from their onset oxidation potential ( φ ox ) and onset reduction potential ( φ red ) according to the following equations : E HOMO = -e(φ ox + 4.8 - φ 1 / 2 , FeCp 2 ) ( eV ) and E LUMO = -e(φ red + 4.8 - φ 1 / 2 , FeCp 2 ) ( eV ) , where the unit of potential is V ( vs. SCE ). 45 As shown in Fig. 3 , the onset oxidation potentials of PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS were determined to be 0.88 , 0.88 and 0.85 V , corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of -5.29 , -5.29 and -5.26 eV , respectively. Compared with polymer TTQ ( -5.06 eV ) , 28 these three copolymers showed lower HOMO levels due to the introduction of the alkylthio side chain.",

The values were different from those obtained by the abovedescribed optical method , which was mainly due to the energy barriers of the charge transfer at the electrodes during the CV measurement. 46 The energy levels of the materials used in the OPVs are shown in Fig. 3. The HOMO levels of these three copolymers were lower than that of P3HT , 47 as shown in Fig. 3. This implies that these three materials in PSCs might have possessed a higher V oc than the P3HT - based counterparts. The LUMO levels of these three copolymers were higher than that of PC61BM ; this induced electron - effective transfer at the donor - acceptor interface. The electrochemical data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 1 . Current density versus voltage ( J-V ) curves of the PSCs based on PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS were shown in Fig. 4.

    "sentence": "Therefore , the J sc of the device based on PBDTQTS was increased from 3.61 to 6.96 mA cm^-2 , which led to an improved PCE ( from 1.37% to 2.78% ). Compared to PBDTQS and PBDTQTS , PTQTS gave the best PCE of 3.73% with V oc of 0.76 V , J sc of 9.41 mA cm^-2 and FF of 52.3% . This was mainly due to the increased light absorption in long wavelength range of this polymer. It could be seen that replacing the BDT unit in PBDTQS and PBDTQTS with a smaller thiophene unit could reduce the steric hindrance of the backbone of PTQTS , which leads to an enhanced intermolecular π-π stacking. Thus , the J sc and FF of PTQTS were obviously improved compared with PBDTQS and PBDTQTS. The device performance of our polymer PTQTS , especially the V oc value , was lower than that of the reported polymer TQ1 by Ergang Wang 's group , 28 which was mainly due to the higher HOMO level of polymer PTQTS because the thiophene substitute group on quinoxaline unit may have stronger electron - donating nature than the phenyl group in TQ1. 48 To verify the accuracy of the J-V measurements , the corresponding external quantum efficiencies ( EQE ) of the devices were measured and shown in Fig. 5. All the three polymers displayed broadened absorption from 350-800 nm. The optimum device PTQTS / PC61BM very efficiently harvests solar light with the maximum EQE of 61.8% at 420 nm , and exhibits a much better photo - response in the range from 350 to 550 nm. Moreover , the calculated J sc , by integrating the spectral response of the cells , were 3.28 , 6.91 , and 9.25 for PBDTQS : PC61BM , PBDTQTS : PC61BM and PTQTS : PC61BM , respectively. The EQE spectra of the polymers : PC61BM ( w : w , 1 : 2 ) based device agreed well with the absorption spectra of the blends , and the highest EQE supported its highest J sc value . In order to understand the effect of active layer morphology on the device performance of PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS , tapping mode height images ( 5 μm × 5 μm ) and phase images ( 5 μm × 5 μm ) of copolymers : PC61BM blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). As shown in Fig. 6 , the surface of PBDTQS : PC61BM blend film exhibited a root - meansquare roughness ( RMS ) of 2.09 nm and a large phase separation , which was not favorable for the charge transfer from the polymer to PC61BM , thus limited the efficiency of the resulting device. 47 The surfaces of PBDTQTS : PC61BM and PTQTS : PC61BM blend films spin - coated from CB showed relatively smooth surfaces with RMS of 1.51 and 1.80 nm , respectively.",

    "sentence": "Consequently , the rougher surface of the PBDTQS PC61BM blend film may affect the contact situation between the active layer and other layer of the PBDTQS based device , which may further influence the performance of the device. 49,50 Fig. 4 J-V curves of the photovoltaic devices under the illumination of AM 1.5 G , 100 mW cm^-2 . In addition to the absorption and energy levels , charge carrier mobility is another crucial factor for achieving high - efficiency devices. The hole mobilities of the three polymers were measured using the space - charge - limited current ( SCLC ) method , with the device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymers : PC61BM / Au ( as shown in Fig. 7 ). The SCLC is described as J SCLC = 9^8 ε 0 ε r μ h V 2 L 3ð1Þ here J stands for current density , ε 0 is the permittivity of free space , ε r is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium , μ h is the hole mobility , V is the internal potential in the device and L is the thickness of the active layer. The internal potential V is obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage ( V bi ) and the voltage drop ( V s ) , obtained from the series resistance of the substrate , from the applied voltage ( V appl ) , according to V = V appl - V bi - V s . As shown in Fig. 7 , according to eqn ( 1 ) , the hole mobilities are calculated to be 1.66 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , 1.17 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and 2.05 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS , respectively. The higher hole mobility of PTQTS was enhanced mainly due to the improved inter-molecular interactions and ordered alignment of the blend film. The higher mobility would benefit for the exciton separation and transport. Therefore , the device based on PTQTS showed higher J sc and FF compared to the other two devices . In summary , three copolymers ( PBDTQS , PBDTQTS and PTQTS ) with alkylthio side chain on the quinoxaline acceptor were designed and synthesized. The UV - vis absorptions , thermal stability , energy levels , morphology and photovoltaic characteristics of the three copolymers were systematically evaluated to understand the relationships between the polymer structures and the photovoltaic performances. Replacing the carbon atom in the side chain of polymer PBDTQS with a thiophene ring could increase the conjugation length in the side chain direction and improve the absorption in the visible region for the copolymers PBDTQTS and PTQTS. Furthermore , polymer PTQTS exhibited a more planar backbone and increased intermolecular π-stacking compared to PBDTQTS , which was due to the thiophene unit in PTQTS having a smaller size and less steric hindrance than those of BDT unit in PBDTQTS.",

    "sentence": "We report on a new series of small band gap conjugated polymers utilizing donor - acceptor - donor substructures in the polymer backbone to broaden and extend the optical absorption to longer wavelengths. Three polymers were prepared by Suzuki polymerization , using the same donoracceptor - donor segment but with different comonomers. The goal was to investigate how the optical and electronic properties of the polymers were influenced by the different comonomers. Electrochemical spectroscopy , using square - wave voltammetry , shows that increasing the electrondonating strength of the comonomer will raise the HOMO energy level of the polymer , resulting in a decreased band gap. This result is also manifested by comparing open - circuit voltages from the corresponding laboratory fabricated solar cells. The best performing photovoltaic cell , based on APFO - Green15 / [60]PCBM ( 1 : 4 w / w ) , reached a J sc of 4.2 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.73 V , and a FF of 0.54 , giving a PCE of 1.7% . Conjugated polymers are promising candidates for photoinduced charge generation and transport media in solar cells , with efficiencies of around 6% recently reported. [1][2][3] In order to make polymer solar cells competitive , their efficiencies need to be increased , a challenge addressed to polymer design , synthesis , and device fabrication. An ideal p - type conjugated polymer has to simultaneously combine strong absorption , small band gap , high hole mobility , good film - forming properties , and suitable energy levels with respect to the n - type material. If the band gap of the polymer is decreased , the absorption spectrum will be broadened , making it possible to utilize more photons for charge generation in the photovoltaic cell. Decreasing the band gap means that either the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of the conjugated polymer is raised or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) is lowered. A raised HOMO gives a lower photovoltage of the device and a lowered LUMO decreases the offset to the LUMO of the n - type material used. An offset of approximately 0.3 eV is required to maintain a sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation and prevent recombination of photogenerated charges. 4,5 In this report we present three small band gap polymers with alternating electron - donating ( D ) and electron - accepting ( A ) units. This design , using DAD - segments in the polymer backbone , creates an internal charge transfer , which reduces the band gap. [6][7][8][9] To investigate how the choice of comonomer influences the polymer properties , one DAD - monomer was Suzuki polymerized with three different comonomers resulting in two low band gap para-phenylene ( LBPP ) polymers and one alternating polyfluorene ( APFO ) polymer. The three comonomers differ in electron - donating strength , which results in three polymers with different optical and electrochemical properties.",

From a solar cell efficiency point of view , this series of materials so far show quite modest performance. However , they serve as a good example of how the molecular structure influences optical and electronic performance . A high polymer molecular weight will guarantee an adequate conjugation length and enhance interchain interactions , yielding an increased hole mobility via strengthened intramolecular charge transport properties and intermolecular hopping. All polymer syntheses were performed using stoichiometric proportions of the comonomers to achieve the highest molecular weight possible. Molecular - weight distributions of the polymers were determined by size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ). Number - average ( M n ) and weight - average molecular weights ( M w ) are presented in Table 1. The molecular weights of APFO - Green15 and LBPP-3 are high to very high as a result of both polymers having solubilizing side - chains on the comonomers. However , the molecular weight of LBPP-3 is most probably overestimated due to polymer aggregation , as indicated by the presence of a high - molecular weight tail of the SEC-curve. The molecular weight of LBPP-4 , lacking solubilizing substituents on the para-phenylene comonomer , is somewhat low. Even after repeating the polymerization of LBPP-4 , higher molecular weights were not obtained . The positions of the HOMO and the LUMO of the polymers are of great importance when evaluating the materials from a solar cell perspective. From the energy levels one can estimate driving forces for charge - transfer processes together with an estimation of the open - circuit photovoltage. These positions can be obtained from electrochemical spectroscopy , where the oxidation peak corresponds to the HOMO and the LUMO can be related to the reduction peak. To measure the electrochemical energy levels , we employed square - wave voltammetry ( SWV ) 20 and cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). 21 SWV is a pulse - voltammetric technique based on chronoamperometry , where the current is sampled as a function of time after applying a potential pulse. The fast - decay nature of the capacitive charging current results in electrochemical data originating from pure Faradic current. Another advantage with SWV is efficient suppression of background currents , yielding well resolved spectra. Fig. 1 shows SWV and CV spectra of the polymers and estimated HOMO and LUMO levels from SWV together with the electrochemical band gap are presented in Table 2. SWV allows estimation of HOMO and LUMO levels from peak potentials , described in the Experimental section below. However , as the oxidation peak of LBPP-3 turned out to be relatively broad , CV spectra were recorded to improve the reliability of the estimated energy levels.",

    "sentence": "The relative position of the onsets of the CV oxidation waves is in agreement with the SWV data presented in Table 2. Additionally , the results from CV in Fig. 1b clearly indicate the electrochemical reversibility of the polymers. The electrochemical data show , that when going from APFO - Green15 to LBPP-4 and finally to LBPP-3 , the oxidation waves are raised towards vacuum implying a smaller band gap. The reason for this is explained by the increasing electron - donating strength of the comonomers. The dioctyloxy phenylene unit present in LBPP-3 is very electron rich due to the electrondonating character of the octyloxy side - chains. This strengthens the electron - donating moieties of the DAD - segment which results in a strong intramolecular charge transfer. The smaller band gap of LBPP-3 compared to LBPP-4 is mainly a result of a raised HOMO , whereas the LUMO position is practically unaffected by the substitution of comonomer. Consequently , APFO - Green15 shows the lowest lying HOMO and largest electrochemical band gap as a result of having the weakest electron - donating comonomer of the three polymers. Looking at the estimated LUMO positions it is evident that all three polymers guarantee a downhill energy offset for charge transfer to [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM , which LUMO positions previously have been estimated to be -4.1 eV by SWV. 17 The electrochemical band gaps of the three polymers range from 1.7 - 2.0 eV . Absorption spectroscopy , measuring transitions between electronic states , provides essential information about the spectral coverage and the magnitude of the band gap. Although information about the location of molecular orbital energies can not be obtained , optical absorption measurements have great resemblance with the charge - generation process in a photovoltaic cell and are of utmost importance when characterizing solar cell materials. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the polymers are given in Fig. 2. The optical band gap of the polymers were estimated from the onset of absorption ( Table 3 ) because vibronic structures often yield broad low - energy absorption peaks , making it hard to distinguish absorption maxima. Estimation of optical band gap from absorption onset is also the preferred method used in scientific publications on conjugated polymers , facilitating comparisons of polymer band gap reported by different research groups. The optical band gaps ( 1.2 - 1.6 eV ) are smaller than the electrochemical band gaps , which is almost always the case when characterizing conjugated polymers. It is important to realize that there should be a difference which can be explained by the dissimilar nature of the measurements where different energy processes contribute to band gap estimation. However , results from optical absorption are in agreement with the conclusion from electrochemistry that an electron - rich comonomer gives a smaller band gap. LBPP-3 shows an absorption spectrum furthest extended to lower energies , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.2 eV , as a direct result of incorporation of the electron - rich dioctyloxy para-phenylene comonomer into the polymer backbone .",

The cells had the general structure glass / ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PCBM / LiF / Al. Previously , the overall performance of polymer solar cells based on alternating polyfluorene copolymers has shown to be dependent on charge transport rather than on the generation of charges. 22 Therefore , we used a 1 : 4 ( w / w ) ratio of polymer : PCBM to improve charge - carrier transport and establish an adequate balance between the hole and electron mobility in the active layer. Fig. 3 shows the EQE of the fabricated devices and all photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables 4 and 5 The active layers were spin coated using different spin speeds to investigate how the thickness and morphology of the active layer influence device performance. Looking at the results using [60]PCBM as electron acceptor , one notices the trend that an increased spin speed , i.e. a thinner active layer , increases the performance of the cells. A thin active layer absorbs less photons but will benefit from good charge collection. Making the layer thicker will result in problems with trapping of photogenerated charges and back reactions in the form of recombination. However , if the charge - carrier mobility is raised , e.g. by improving the hole - transporting properties of the p - type polymer , the extent of charge recombination will be reduced which in turn allows a thicker active layer , enhancing the solar cell performance by increased photon absorption. APFO - Green15 shows the highest open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) which is expected from the low HOMO level of the fluorene unit , and is also in agreement with the anodic peak potential results from SWV. The excellent hole - transporting properties of the fluorene segment are signified by a satisfactory short - circuit current ( J sc ) using APFO - Green15 as p - type material. The same trends are seen from the photovoltaic cells with [70]PCBM as ntype material. However , these cells generally show a poorer performance compared with the cells using [60]PCBM . Separation of photogenerated charges takes place at the interface between the polymer and n - type material in the active layer. A large interfacial area is required due to the short lifetimes of excitons , limiting their diffusion length to approximately 10 nm. [23][24][25] The photovoltaic cells were prepared using the bulkheterojunction concept , 26 not only to create a large interfacial area but also to provide continuous pathways for efficient charge collection.

To some extent , the morphology of the active layer in a bulk - heterojunction polymer solar cell can be controlled by the choice of solvent or by addition of a small amount of a solvent with low evaporation rate during the spin coating procedure. 27 However , this kind of morphological optimization has not yet been done for polymers presented in this paper . By copolymerizing one DAD monomer with three different comonomers , three conjugated polymers were prepared with the aim of investigating how different chemical and electronic structures influence the properties of the final polymers. The results show , that when selecting a comonomer with a high electron - donating strength , the band gap of the polymer is decreased , primarily by raising the HOMO energy level. This lowers the V oc of the photovoltaic cell , whereas the downhill driving force for exciton dissociation remains unchanged. The choice of comonomer will also partly influence the morphology of the active layer. Side - chains increase the solubility of the polymer , but will induce formation of domains in the active layer , resulting in an inefficient charge separation and charge collection at the electrodes .",

    "sentence": "Two copolymers P1 and P2 , with regioregular and random structures , respectively , were synthesized and their optical and electrochemical properties ( both theoretical and experimental ) were investigated. The regioregular copolymer P1 showed a lower optical bandgap and a high degree of crystallinity compared to the random P2 copolymer. These copolymers were used as electron donors along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed bulk heterojunction solar cells. After the optimization of the weight ratio between the donor and the acceptor and the concentration of the solvent additive i.e. DIO in chloroform , the solar cells based on regioregular P1 exhibit higher power conversion efficiency ( 7.66% ) than the random P2 ( 5.33% ). The enhancement in the power conversion efficiency has been attributed to the increased hole mobility due to the high regioregularity of the conjugated copolymer backbone and effective ordering between the polymer chains. This work brings forth and establishes the importance of copolymers having a regioregular A-D-A-D structure so as to offer significant performance benefits over the random D-A copolymer. This approach is a promising new route to materials for highly efficient polymer solar cells. † Electronic supplementary information ( ESI ) available. See Throughout the last decade , polymer solar cells ( PSC ) with a bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) based on nano-composites ( polymer donor : fullerene acceptor ) have attracted significant attention as renewable energy sources due to their unique advantages , such as low cost , manufacturability , easy possibility for large - area flexible devices manufacturing , 1,2 attaining , at the same time , impressive progress in PSC effectiveness by more than 10% . [3][4][5][6] This progress has been achieved not only through better understanding and control of charge generation and transport , but also via development of a wide range of new narrow bandgap D-A conjugated copolymers 7,8 using generally the donor - acceptor ( D-A ) approach , i.e. copolymers based on alternating fragments of electron donor ( D ) and electron acceptor ( A ) units. However , common D-A copolymers have several disadvantages including the fact that common polycondensation does n't permit obtaining regioselective polymers D-A using asymmetrical monomers. It is well known , that electronic and optical properties of D-A copolymers are strongly dependent on structural order. PSC based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) with alternating regular structures exhibit higher efficiency with light absorption and charge carrier mobility improved by intermolecular π-stacking interactions in comparison with statistical P3HT where substituents are oriented randomly along the backbone chain. 9 Moreover the regioregular D-A copolymer showed a higher charge carrier mobility than its random counterpart. Recently , Lee et al. synthesized the regioregular PBDTTT-C-T copolymer which exhibited a narrower optical bandgap ( 1.55 eV ) and a higher crystallinity degree compared to the random polymer PBDTTT-C-T. Inverted PSC based on regioregular PBDTTT-C-T possessed a conversion efficiency of 7.79% , which was 19% higher than for PSC based on the random PBDTTT-C-T polymer.",

The random BFR1 copolymer had an efficiency of 3.91% and the corresponding regioregular BFS3 polymer analogue ( as a part of polymer solar cell ) was found to have an effectiveness of 5.92% , which was 51% higher than that of the PSC based on the random BFR1 copolymer. 11 Using molecular modeling and 2D-GISAXS methods , they have proved conclusively that the intermolecular π-stacking interactions have been improved. These data were confirmed by AFM. Thus , photo - absorption improvement and charge carrier mobility increase due to high regioregularity of the conjugated polymers and efficient ordering of polymer chains are the most likely reasons for the increased PSC energy conversion efficiency. Moreover , fluorination has attracted much attention due to its multiple effects on the optical and electronic properties of resulting copolymers , i.e. the strong withdrawing ability of the fluorine atom can effectively modulate the energy levels of copolymers with minor effects on their bandgap and induce the strong dipole along the C-F bond resulting in the strong inter / intramolecular interaction which benefits exciton dissociation and charge transport. 12 Recently , Li et al. have developed a D-A structured copolymer denoted as PBDD-4ff4T with the benzodithiophene-4,8-dione acceptor and difluorinated bithiophene ( ff2T ) as the donor unit , used it as a donor along with PC71BM as the acceptor for BHJ PSC and achieved an impressive PCE of 9.2% without any extra treatment. 13 Inspired by these results , in this article , we have synthesized the regioregular copolymer P1 based on fluorine - containing 2,6-bis(7-bromo-6-fluoro-2-hexyl-2H-benzotriazol-4-yl)-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene ( M3 ) and the distannyl monomer M1 and the corresponding random D-A polymer analogue P2 based on asymmetric dibromide 2-hexyl-4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole ( M2 ). As shown in Scheme 2 , we present a step - by - step synthetic strategy based on the A-D-A intermediate , which allows obtaining regioregular polymers through the fixed orientation of the acceptor unit. To demonstrate this strategy we have chosen the monofluorinated precursor , 2-hexyl-4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole ( M2 ) , which exhibits asymmetrical reactivity between ortho-and meta-positions. The obtained random polymer based on P2 inherently possesses a structural disadvantage negatively affecting photovoltaic solar cells characteristics. Due to the fact that the acceptor monomer M2 has an asymmetric molecular structure , it is impossible to control the 2-hexyl-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole unit orientation in the conjugated polymer chain during the polycondensation reaction. So , the P2 copolymer generally has random structural regioregularity. Regioregular P1 exhibits a narrow bandgap ( E opt g = 1.75 eV ) , and a higher crystallinity degree compared with random P2. These copolymers were used as donors along with PC71BM as the acceptor for the fabrication of conventional BHJ PSC solar cells.",

The UV - visible absorption spectra of the P1 and P2 in chloroform solutions and in thin films are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding optical data are summarized in Table 1. Both polymers showed a strong absorption peak around 600 nm ( molar extinction coefficient 3.4 × 10^5 and 2.45 × 10^5 mol^-1 cm^-1 for P1 and P2 , respectively ) originating from delocalized excitonic π-π* transitions of the conjugated polymer backbone. Interestingly , the regioregular P1 exhibited stronger absorption intensity than the random P2 which could be ascribed to vigorous π-π* transitions of the conjugated polymer chain. In dilute solutions , the main absorption band of the regioregular polymer P1 is bathochromically shifted by 15 nm and broadened to some extent in comparison to that of its random counterpart P2. This difference can be attributed to enhanced intermolecular π-π interactions resulting from the regioregular arrangement of the polymer main chain. 16 In the solid - state absorption spectra these differences were even more pronounced. It was found that the absorption spectrum of P1 in the solid thin film has a stronger shoulder peak at 641 nm than those of random P2 , indicating good intermolecular π-π* stacking of regioregular P1. This result clearly indicates that the structural regioregularity of the conjugated backbones in P1 copolymers can have a significant effect on their optical properties.

Consequently , the electron transfer from the polymers ( electron donor ) to PC71BM ( electron acceptor ) , which is the essential process for the charge separation of the excitons , can be allowed. 14 The E ele g values of P1 and P2 is larger ( 0.25 - 0.17 eV ) than the E opt g values. This discrepancy between the electrochemical and optical band gaps presumably resulted from the exciton binding energies of the polymers and / or the energy barrier at the interface between the polymer film and the electrode surface. 15 In order to get information about the molecular stacking of the copolymers , X-ray diffraction patterns were measured for the regioregular P1 and random P2 films ( Fig. 6 ). The copolymer P1 and P2 showed pronounced diffraction peaks at 2θ = 5.28 ° and 4.64 ° , respectively. These diffraction peaks corresponding to the lamellar d 100 spacing which originated from the separation between the conjugated copolymer backbones and depending on the length as well as the orientation of side chains , were estimated to be 16.82 Å and 17.56 Å for regioregular P1 and random P2 , respectively. In addition to the above , the stronger and wider diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22.48 ° and 22.04 ° for P1 and P2 films , respectively were observed in the XRD pattern , which was assigned to d 010 -spacing. The d 010 spacing corresponds to the π-π stacking distance of the conjugated polymer backbones of 3.64 Å and 3.98 Å in the regioregular P1 and random P2 , respectively. Moreover , the intensity of the d 010 peak in the P1 is much stronger than that in P2.

In Table 2 , we also provide the character of the first allowed excitations only for contributions larger than 4% . The first excitation , as calculated by each of the functional for all three structures , clearly exhibits a single - configuration character. In Fig. 7 , we have plotted the isosurfaces ( isovalue = 0.02 ) of the HOMO and LUMO for both structures. In both cases the HOMO extends evenly over the main body. For the LUMO of each structure the delocalizations are also similar. The LUMO of P1 and P2 extends over the main structure but considerably more over the triazole group than in the case of the respective HOMOs. To quantify the contributions of the moieties to the frontier orbitals we have calculated the total and partial density of states ( PDOS ). The PDOSs for P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. S6 ( ESI † ). We partition all of the structures into the silolodithiophene ( SDT ) and fluorobenzotriazole ( FBT ) moieties. As expected , structures P1 and P2 have significant similarities on the delocalization of the frontier orbitals. The contributions of the SDT and FBT moieties to the HOMO of P1 are 71.3% and 28.5% , respectively , and for P2 at 70.4% and 29.4% respectively. For the LUMO of P1 the contributions of the SDT and FBT moieties are 50.0% and 48.4% , respectively , and for P2 at 50.2% and 48.2% , respectively. We note that , besides their similarities , structures P1 and P2 exhibit different dipole moments which is reflected in the difference in their solubility. In Fig. 8 , we show the UV / Visual absorption spectra of the P1 and P2 structures calculated at the TD - DFT / M06 level of theory , both accounting for solvent effects for CF and in the gas phase. The spectra have been produced by convoluting Gaussian functions with HWHM = 0.22 eV centered at the excitation wavenumbers. In Fig. S7 ( see the ESI † ) we also provide the corresponding spectra calculated using the B3LYP functional , which is in remarkable agreement with the spectra using the M06 functional , and only slightly underestimates in the long wavelength region ( by ∼ 40 nm ). The calculated absorption spectra of P1 and P2 are almost the same and they exhibit one main band with high absorbance , at ∼ 555 nm , as well as a low intensity peak at smaller wavelengths at ∼ 280 nm. The theoretical absorption spectra closely matched the experimentally observed absorption spectra .",

    "sentence": "In order to examine the influence of the structural regioregularity of conjugated copolymer backbones on the photovoltaic performance of solar cell devices , conventional BHJ polymer solar cells were fabricated with the structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / copolymer : PC71BM / PFN / Al. The active layers were spin coated from copolymer / PC71BM solutions prepared from either the CF or 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO , 3v % )-CF mixture. First of all , we have varied the weight ratio of the copolymer to PC71BM in chloroform solution and found that the best photovoltaic response was observed for the active layers with weight ratios of 1 : 2 for both copolymers and the photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. Without DIO the devices showed PCEs of 3.87% ( J sc = 8.58 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.46 ) and 2.53% ( J sc = 6.88 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.92 V and FF = 0.40 ) for P1 and P2 , respectively. In order to improve the PCE further , we have employed the solvent additive method as reported in the literature for PSCs. 26 We are only discussing the results on the devices based on the optimized active layer , i.e. the weight ratio of the copolymer to PC71BM is 1 : 2 and the concentration of DIO is 3v % in CF. The current - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of devices based on P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM processed with DIO ( 3v % ) / CF are shown in Fig. 9a and photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. It can be seen from Fig. 9a and Table 3 that a clear improvement in PCE was observed in going from random ( P2 ) ( 5.33% ) to the regioregular ( P1 ) ( 7.66% ) copolymer. The higher value of V oc for P1 as compared to P2 is related to the deeper HOMO level of P1 as compared to P2. Moreover , compared to the PSC with random P2 , the improvement in PCE of the PSC with P1 may also result from enhanced values of J sc and FF. The IPCE spectra of the devices were investigated and shown in Fig. 9b. The IPCE spectra of the devices closely resemble the absorption spectra of the blended active layers. The response in the short wavelength region of 350-500 nm is attributed to the contribution of PC71BM. 27 The IPCE spectra in the longer wavelength region ( 500-750 nm ) correspond to the absorption of copolymers and are different for these devices. The values of IPCE for the device based on P1 are higher than that for P2 , which also supports the higher value of J sc for the former polymer than for the later one.",

It is well known that the charge carrier mobility in the active layer is very important in polymer solar cells. In order to get information about the influence of the intermolecular interactions on the hole mobility of the active layers , we have prepared the hole only and electron only devices and measured the hole and electron mobilities in the active layers based on P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM films. The measured J-V characteristics of the hole and electron only devices are shown in Fig. 10 and charge carrier mobilities are estimated by fitting these curves with the space charge limited current model. 28 The hole mobility values for P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM are 1.16 × 10^-4 and 8.04 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. The regioregular P1 showed an improved mobility compared to random P2. This may be attributed to the highly improved π-π stacking due to the structural regioregularity of conjugated copolymer backbones. 29 This is also supported by the observed red - shift and clear vibronic shoulder in the absorption spectrum of P1 in a thin film in the longer wavelength region. Moreover , XRD data also clearly indicate that the improved hole mobility of regioregular P1 due to the high regioregularity of conjugated polymer chains and effective ordering between polymer chains may be the most likely reason for enhancement of PCE. 30 The electron mobilities for P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM are about 2.56 × 10^-4 and 2.42 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. Therefore , the ratios of electron to hole mobilities are 2.19 and 3.00 , for P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM based devices , respectively , indicating more balanced charge transport in the device based on P1 : PC71BM as compared to P2 : PC71BM , leading to a higher value of FF and PCE. The nanoscale morphology of P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM thin films processed with DIO / CF solvent was investigated using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and is shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen from Fig. 11 that both the active layers processed with DIO / CF exhibit nanoscale features , indicating fine phase separation of copolymers and PC71BM with DIO additive. 31 The black domain is assigned to PC71BM aggregation because its ordered aggregation gives a relatively high electron density compared to polymer aggregation. 32 The P1 : PC71BM film has a more uniform morphology and better interpenetrating networks than the P2 : PC71BM film.",

    "sentence": "The P1 : PC71BM layer showed a finer network of bright and dark regions with appropriate nanoscale phase separation between the copolymer P1 and the PC71BM phase , which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport , resulting in improved J sc , FF and PCE. In order to get information about the charge generation in the devices based on P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM due to the different structures of copolymers , we measured the photocurrent density ( J ph ) as a function of effective voltage ( V eff ) as shown in Fig. 12. The measured J ph is defined as J ph = J L - J D , where J L and J D are the current density under illumination ( 100 mW cm^-2 ) and in the dark , respectively. V eff is given as V eff = V o - V appl , where V o is the compensation voltage at which J ph = 0 and V appl is the applied voltage. It can be seen from J ph -V eff plots that at low V eff , the J ph increases linearly with V eff and tend to saturate at higher V eff in both the devices , at which the internal electric field is large enough to dissociate all the photogenerated excitons into free charge carriers. This voltage is also responsible to sweep out all free charge carriers towards the electrodes. 33 We have observed that the J ph starts to saturate at lower V eff for P1 : PC71BM as compared to P2 : PC71BM , indicating that due to the regioregular nature of P1 with the enhanced intermolecular interactions , the low internal electric field in needed to sweep out the charge carriers in this device as compared to the P2 based device. We have estimated the probability of charge collection ( P c ) of separated carriers using P c = J sc / J phsat and the values of P c are 0.86 and 0.80 for P1 : PC71BM and P2 : PC71BM based devices , respectively. The higher value of P c for the P1 : PC71BM device is attributed to the better nanoscale morphology and balanced charge transport. We have estimated the series resistance ( R s ) and shunt resistance ( R sh ) from the slope of the J-V characteristics of the devices , under illumination , around the V oc and J sc , respectively , and compiled them in Table 3. In general , the R s of the organic solar cell is composed of the bulk resistance of the active layer and depends on the charge transportability within the active layer and the morphology of the active layer. It can be seen from Table 3 that the R s of the device based on P1 : PC71BM is lower than that for P2 : PC71BM which may be attributed to the better morphology and balanced charge transport.",

    "sentence": "The increase in R sh is related to the decrease in leakage current and depends upon the intermolecular interaction ( or electronic ) coupling between the donor and acceptor materials in the active layer . Two copolymers P1 ( regioregular ) and P2 ( random ) were successfully synthesized. Regioregular copolymer P1 showed a slightly lower optical bandgap ( 1.75 eV ) and higher crystallinity compared to random copolymer P2. These copolymers were used as donor materials along with PC71BM as the acceptor for the fabrication of bulk heterojunction PSCs. After the optimization of active layers ( weight ratio between copolymers and PC71BM and concentration of solvent additive ) , PSC based on P1 shows a conversion efficiency of 7.66% which is higher than that for the random copolymer P2 ( 5.33% ). Improved photo - absorption and charge carriers mobility due to the high regioregularity of conjugated copolymers and efficient ordering of copolymer chains are most likely the cause of PSC energy conversion efficiency increasing. This study suggests that the P1 copolymer can achieve high PCE due to the increase in structural regioregularity of conjugated polymer chains. Although , both the active layers processed with DIO / CF show uniform nanoscale features however the P1 : PC71BM film exhibits a more uniform morphology and better interpenetrating networks than the P2 : PC71BM film , resulting in improved J sc , FF and PCE. Moreover , the approach we have described here also provides an opportunity to further modulate the optical and electronic properties of conjugated copolymers through the use of two different donor units .",

    "sentence": "An alternative D-A copolymer of a dithienosilole ( DTS ) donor unit and a fluorinated-benzotriazole ( FBTA ) acceptor unit with a thiophene p - bridge , PDTS - DTFBTA , was designed and synthesized , for application as a donor material in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) with thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min showed a PCE of 3.93% with a V oc of 0.64 V , which is slightly improved in comparison with its analogous polymer ( PDTS - DTBTA ) without the fluorine substitution. By using indene-C 60 bisadduct ( ICBA ) instead of PC 70 BM as acceptor , the PCE was improved to 4.99% with a high V oc of 0.85 V. PDTS - DTFBTA is the first reported fluorinated D-A copolymer which shows improved photovoltaic performance with ICBA as acceptor compared to PCBM . Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have drawn great attentions [1][2][3][4][5] as a promising technology for renewable energy in recent years , because of their advantages of simple device structure , low cost , light weight , and easy largearea fabrication on exible substrates. The key point of the studies of PSCs is increasing the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) by developing new low band gap polymer donors , [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] new fullerene derivative acceptors [16][17][18][19] and new interface modication layers. [20][21][22] In the molecular design of polymer donor and fullerene acceptor photovoltaic materials for higher efficiency PSCs , there are several factors which should be considered , 5 including ( i ) broad absorption with high absorption coefficient in the visiblenear infrared region , ( ii ) good matching of electronic energy levels between the donor and acceptor materials , i.e. , the LUMO and HOMO of the donor should be higher than the corresponding energy levels of the acceptor by at least 0.3 - 0.5 eV for efficient charge separation at the donor - acceptor interface , and the energy difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor should be as large as possible to get higher open circuit voltage ( V oc ) ; ( iii ) high and balanced hole mobility of the donor phase and electron mobility of the acceptor phase in the active layer ; and ( iv ) capability to selfassemble into a nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the BHJ blend of the donor and acceptor to enable efficient charge separation and charge transportation. For conjugated polymer donor materials , a planar molecular structure , broad absorption , and lower HOMO energy levels are very important to meet the above mentioned requirements. Substitution by electron - withdrawing groups 6,23 and donor (D)acceptor ( A ) copolymerization [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] are efficient approaches to broaden the absorption and downward - shi of the HOMO energy levels of the conjugated polymer.",

Here , to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the D-A copolymer , we synthesized a new D-A copolymer of DTS and uorine substituted BTA with a thiophene p - bridge , PDTS - DTFBTA , as shown in Scheme 1. Compared to PDTS - DTBTA , 31 PDTS - DTFBTA with two uorine atoms substituted on the benzotriazole ( BTA ) unit demonstrated a lower HOMO energy level ( by ca. 0.09 eV ) , as expected , which is benecial for a higher V oc of the PSCs based on the polymer as donor. The PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA / PC 70 BM demonstrated a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.93% with V oc = 0.64 V , under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . Interestingly , the PCE of the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA was improved greatly when indene-C 60 bisadduct ( ICBA ) 16 was used as acceptor instead of PC 70 BM , which reached 4.99% with a high V oc of 0.85 V. ICBA and its corresponding C 70 derivative IC 70 BA 17 possess 0.17 - 0.19 eV higher LUMO energy levels than PCBM , and displayed excellent photovoltaic performance with higher V oc when they are used as acceptors blended with the polymer donor of P3HT 16,17 and other polythiophene derivatives such as poly(3-pentylthiophene) ( P3PT ) 32 and twodimension - conjugated polythiophenes. 33 However , most D-A copolymer donor materials show poorer photovoltaic performance when using ICBA as acceptor , except for two recently reported D-A copolymers based on dithienosilole and thiazolothiazole 34 and based on thienothiophene and bithiazole 35 which show improved photovoltaic performance with ICBA as acceptor compared to PCBM.",

    "sentence": "Considering the importance of the application of the new acceptor ICBA on the high efficiency D-A copolymers to further increase the V oc and PCE , it is very important to nd more D-A copolymer examples which match with ICBA , for designing high efficiency D-A copolymer donor materials . Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of PDTS - DTFBTA solution in chloroform and lm on quartz plate , together with the absorption spectrum of PDTS - DTBTA lm 31 for comparison. It can be seen that PDTS - DTFBTA demonstrates a broad absorption band both in solution and in solid lm with absorption maxima at 566 nm for the polymer solution and at 577 nm for the polymer lm. The absorption in solid state is red shied by 11 nm compared with that of the polymer solution. In comparison with the absorption spectrum of PDTS - DTBTA lm , PDTS - DTFBTA lm displayed a similar absorption spectrum , but a stronger shoulder peak at ca. 630 nm , indicating that the uorine substitution in PDTS - DTFBTA results in stronger interchain interactions in the polymer lms. The XRD pattern of PDTS - DTFBTA displayed a stronger peak at 2q = 5.34 , as shown in Fig. S2 in ESI. † The XRD diffraction peak at 2q = 5.34 corresponds to an interchain d-spacing of 16.6Å , which indicates that there is some ordered structure in the PDTS - DTFBTA lm. The absorption spectra of the blend lms of PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM and PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA with a weight ratio of 1 : 1 were compared in Fig. 1b. The absorption spectrum of the PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM lm is stronger than that of the PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA lm in the range of 350-550 nm ( see Fig. 1b ) because of the stronger absorption of PC 70 BM in this region. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the polymers and estimate its highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels. 36 Fig. 2a shows the cyclic voltammogram ( CV ) of the PDTS - DTFBTA lm on Pt disk electrode in 0.1 mol L -1 Bu 4 NPF 6 acetonitrile solution. The onset reduction potential ( 4 red ) of PDTS - DTFBTA is -1.48 V vs. Ag / Ag + , while the onset oxidation potential ( 4 ox ) is 0.43 V vs. Ag / Ag + . From the values of 4 red and 4 ox of the polymer , the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of PDTS - DTFBTA were calculated to be -3.23 and -5.14 eV , respectively , according to the equations of LUMO = -e(4 red + 4.71 ) ( eV ) and HOMO = -e(4 ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ).",

    "sentence": "36a,37 The HOMO energy level of PDTS - DTFBTA is lower than that ( -5.05 eV ) of PDTS - DTBTA due to the double uorine substitution. The electronic energy level diagrams of the two different donor and acceptor materials were displayed in Fig. 2b. The HOMO energy levels of PDTS - DTBTA and PDTS - DTFBTA are -5.05 and -5.14 eV , respectively. The lower HOMO energy level of PDTS - DTFBTA is desirable for its application as a donor in PSCs to get a higher V oc . In addition , compared to PC 70 BM , the higher LUMO energy level of ICBA could also result in a higher V oc of the PSCs because the V oc is usually proportional to the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor . The photovoltaic properties of PDTS - DTFBTA were studied by fabricating bulk heterojunction PSCs with the device conguration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PDTS - DTFBTA : acceptor / Ca / Al. Here , two different fullerene derivatives , PC 70 BM and ICBA , were used as acceptors in the PSCs. Fig. 3a shows the J-V curves of the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA and PC 70 BM under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . The PSCs with varied weight ratios ( PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM from 1 : 1 to 1 : 2 ) in the active layer were investigated , and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 1. Optimized performances were achieved with a PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM weight ratio of 1 : 1 , and the optimized devices annealed at 120 °C for 10 min show an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.64 V , a short circuit current density ( J sc ) of 9.65 mA cm^-2 , and a ll factor ( FF ) of 63.7% , giving a PCE of 3.93% . The efficiency of 3.93% is slightly improved over that ( 3.80% ) of the PSC device based on PDTS - DHBTA. 31 Increasing the PC 70 BM content to the weight ratios of 1 : 1.5 and 1 : 2 resulted in a decrease of the J sc and PCE values of the PSCs , as shown in Fig. 3a. The performance decrease could be due to the reduction of the polymer donor content , which results in the reduction of absorption and unbalanced hole - electron transportation of the active layer.",

    "sentence": "It should be mentioned that although the HOMO energy level of PDTS - DHFBTA is 0.09 eV lower than that of PDTS - DHBTA , the V oc of 0.64 V for the PSCs based on PDTS - DHFBTA is only 0.01 V higher than that ( 0.63 V ) of the device based on PDTS - DHBDT. The V oc value of the PSCs based on PDTS - DHFBTA is lower than that expected from the lower HOMO energy level of PDTS - DHFBTA which could be limited by a relatively higher carrier recombination rate at the polymerfullerene interface. 37a A similar phenomenon has been observed by Wang et. al. 37b The relatively higher concentration of the terminal end group ( structural defects ) brought about by its low molecular weight M n of 6.3 K for PDTS - DTFBTA could serve as charge carrier traps and is a possible reason for boosting the charge recombination. To further improve the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA , we tried to use ICBA instead of PC 70 BM as acceptor. ICBA possesses a higher LUMO level than PCBM , which leads to a higher V oc and PCE of the PSCs based on P3HT. 16,20 The J-V curves of the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA / ICBA are shown in Fig. 3b , and the detailed photovoltaic results are also listed in Table 1. Compared with the PC 70 BM - based devices , it can be seen that the PSC based on PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) with thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min demonstrated a signicantly higher V oc of 0.85 V and a high PCE of 4.99% . In comparison with the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) with thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min , V oc is increased by 35% from 0.64 to 0.85 V , the ll factor ( FF ) is improved from 63.7% to 67.6% , and the PCE is increased by 27% from 3.93% to 4.99% . The increase of V oc benets from the higher LUMO energy level of ICBA , and the higher PCE resulting from the increased V oc and improved FF. Nevertheless , the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) of the PSC with ICBA as acceptor is slightly decreased from 9.65 mA cm^-2 for the PSC with PC 70 BM as acceptor to 8.69 mA cm^-2 , probably due to the weak visible absorption of ICBA than PC 70 BM and the enhanced recombination caused by the structural defects of the polymer end group.",

Without the thermal treatment , the PCE of the device is only 2.7% with a V oc of 0.82 V , a J sc of 6.09 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 54.1% . Aer thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min , the V oc , J sc , FF and PCE were all improved to 0.85 V , 8.69 mA cm^-2 , 67.6% and 4.99% respectively. By annealing , higher photovoltaic parameters of the PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA devices were obtained , and the PCE of the devices was improved from 2.7% to 4.99% . External quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM ( or ICBA ) are shown in Fig. 4. The PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM device showed a high photoconversion efficiency with a peak EQE value of over 60% , which agrees with the high J sc of the devices. The PSC based on PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM displayed higher EQE values than that of device based on PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA in the region of 350 to 550 nm , which could be ascribed to the stronger absorption of PC 70 BM in the wavelength region. In addition , the effect of thermal annealing on the PSCs based on PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA was also conrmed from the EQE measurements. The EQE spectra of the device without thermal annealing showed obviously lower EQE values , which is consistent with the lower J sc of the corresponding PSCs . The morphology of the photoactive layer is also very important for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. 38 We used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to investigate the morphology of the blend lms of PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM and PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA without and with thermal treatment , as shown in Fig. 5. The lm smoothness is an important factor affecting the device performance because a smooth surface induces better contact with the electrode. At the same 1 : 1 blend ratio , the PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM blend lm showed a smoother surface compared to the PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA blend lms , the root mean square ( RMS ) roughness is 1.61 nm for PDTS - DTFBTA : PC 70 BM , and 3.01 and 2.44 nm for PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA without and with thermal treatment , respectively. In comparison with the blend lms of PDTS - DTFBTA : ICBA without and with thermal treatment , the blend lm with thermal annealing displayed a smoother surface with the roughness decreased from 3.01 to 2.44 nm.",

    "sentence": "Two novel low band gap soluble copolymers , P1 and P2 , were synthesized and characterized. P1 consisted of alternating dihexyloxyphenylene and R- [[4-(diphenylamino)phenyl]methylene]-4-nitro-benzeneacetonitrile. P2 consisted of alternating dihexyloxyphenylene and R,R 0 -[(1,4-phenylene)dimethylidyne]bis(RZ,R 0 Z)-4-nitrobenzeneacetonitrile. These copolymers showed broad absorption curves with long - wavelength absorption maximum around 620 nm and optical band of 1.68 and 1.64 eV for P1 and P2 , respectively. Both P1 and P2 were blended with PCBM to study the photovoltaic response of bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells. The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) levels of both P1 and P2 are well aligned with those of PCBM acceptor. This allows efficient photoinduced charge transfer and high open circuit voltage , leading to an overall power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.15% and 2.60% for the as cast P1 : PCBM - and P2 : PCBM - based devices , respectively. The PCE of the devices has been further improved up to 4.06% and 3.35% for the devices based on thermally annealed P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM blends , respectively . Organic solar cells using conjugated molecular materials have become increasingly feasible through the development of BHJ structures based on intimate blends of polymeric donors and soluble fullerene acceptors , [1][2][3][4] where efficient exciton separation is enabled by a large - area donor - acceptor interface. 5,6 The attractive features of this type of solar cell include the ease of solution - processing , low costs , light weight , and the potential application in flexible large - area devices. 7,8 So far , such devices based on polymer / fullerene blends have achieved high PCEs of more than 6% . [9][10][11][12] In order to further improve the efficiency of BHJ polymer solar cells , the research is focused on the synthesis of new polymers. From the materials perspective , these donor polymers should not only have a low band gap ( to increase the short circuit current , J sc ) but also bear a low energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) ( to improve the open circuit voltage , V oc ). 13 Typically , a low band gap polymer is designed via a \" donor - acceptor \" ( D-A ) approach , which is to incorporate electron - rich and electron - deficient moieties in the polymer backbone. The low band gap is mainly caused by the intramolecular charge transfer between donor and acceptor units. 14 In D-A copolymer , the electron unit provides a deeper HOMO level , whereas electron acceptor is used to tune the electronic bang gap. 10 In fact , several low band gap polymers have been demonstrated with decent efficiencies ( 3-6 % ) when they were blended with PCBM or [6,6]-phenyl C70 - butyric acid methyl ester ( PC70BM ) in typical BHJ devices.",

For the applications in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , PPVs 36 and polythiophenes ( PTs ) 37 have attracted much attention due to their good film - forming and optical properties. Up to now , the PSCs based on a blend of PPVs or PTs and PCBM have exhibited PCE over 3% 38 and 6% , 39,34 respectively. Recently , a PCE about 7.4% has been achieved from PTB7 / PC71BM solar cell devices. 40 However , the PCE of the PSCs is still low , which is mainly suffered from the narrow absorption band and the low charge carrier mobility of the π-conjugated polymers. To fabricate high - efficiency solar cells , the promising conjugated polymers should possess a broader absorption to enlarge absorption spectrum range and higher charge carrier mobility to reduce charge recombination and increase the photocurrent. Various low band gap small molecules and polymers carrying cyanovinylene 4-nitrophenyls have been synthesized in our laboratory and used for BHJ solar cells 41 and dye - sensitized solar cells 42 with enhanced efficiency. In continuation of this research line , herein we synthesized two novel alternating phenylenevinylene copolymers P1 and P2 with the D-A structure. Particularly , both copolymers contained the hexyloxyphenylene as one constructional unit. The other constructional unit was the R-[ [4-(diphenylamino)phenyl]methylene]-4-nitrobenzeneacetonitrile for P1 and R,R 0 -[(1,4-phenylene)dimethylidyne]bis(RZ,R 0 Z)-4-nitrobenzeneacetonitrile for P2.

    "sentence": "The higher value of PCE for P1 : PCBM has been attributed to ( i ) the higher difference in the LUMO levels between P1 and PCBM as compared to the difference in LUMO levels of P2 and PCBM and ( ii ) the relatively higher value of the hole mobility for P1. When thermally annealed P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM active layers are used in the device , the PCE was further increased up to 4.06% and 3.35% , respectively. This enhanced PCE with thermally annealed blends has been related to the increase in both crystallinity of donor material in blend and hole mobility. On the other hand , in order to improve organic photovoltaic cells , our efforts should not be solely focused in enhancing their power conversion efficiency as it will be proved pointless without addressing their weaknesses , i.e. , poor UV - light stability and reduced lifetime. These limiting factors must be taken seriously into account as they are responsible for the loss of the electronic properties of the material used in the active layer after a very short time in use conditions. Several recent reports concerning the study of lifetime of the organic devices , during storage both in the dark 46 and under illumination , 47,48 have been published. The degradation of organic solar cells may be caused by several factors , and the photodegradation of the organic active layer is one of them. 49,50 It has been well established that the component has to be protected from the atmosphere ; 51 however , the behavior of the active layer materials under illumination and in the absence of oxygen has to be further investigated. Despite the efforts of providing an efficient protection to the solar cell against oxygen and humidity , the photodegradation of the materials can not be avoided. The direct absorption of UV - vis light by the chromophores of polymeric matrix can be responsible for photophysical processes and direct photochemical reactions. It is well - known that under the impact of light and without involvement of oxygen , [52][53][54][55] aromatic polymers for instance can undergo various reactions , involving rearrangement ( photo - Fries , Norrish y ) , chain scissions , or cross-linking. Several experiments have been conducted , involving the artificially accelerated aging of the materials. The data obtained from these experiments suggest that , if well protected of oxygen ( encapsulation ) , this active layer is photochemically stable for several years in real conditions of aging. 56 Synthesis and Characterization. Copolymer P1 was synthesized by a four - step reaction sequence which is outlined in Scheme 1. In particular , compounds 1^60 and 2^60 were synthesized according to the literature. The Heck reaction of 2 with 1,4-divinyl-2,5-bis(hexyloxy)benzene gave copolymer 3. This reaction took place in DMF utilizing Et 3 N as acid scavenger and Pd(OAc) 2 as catalyst.

The reaction of 6 with 4-nitrobenzyl cyanide gave 7. Finally , the latter reacted with 1,4-divinyl-2,5-bis(hexyloxy)benzene to afford P2. Both copolymers were soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane , chloroform , and THF due to the hexyloxy side groups. P1 displayed higher solubility in these solvents than P2. The noncoplanar configuration of triphenylamine of P1 enhanced its solubility. In contrast , the two cyanovinylene 4-nitrophenyls of P2 suppressed the solubility of this copolymer. The crude products were purified by dissolution in THF and precipitation into methanol. The copolymers were obtained in 74% and 78% yield and had number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of 13^500 and 11^200 , by GPC , with a polydispersity of 2.3 and 2.1 for P1 and P2 , respectively.

Photophysical and Electrochemical Properties. Figure 2 presents the UV - vis absorption spectra of copolymers in both dilute ( 10^-5 M ) THF solution and thin film. Table 1 summarizes the photophysical and electrochemical characteristics of copolymers. The absorption curves were broad and extended from 300 up to ∼ 750 nm in solution and ∼ 800 nm in thin film. P2 exhibited broader absorption than P1 in both solution and thin film. The copolymers displayed a short - wavelength absorption maximum ( λ a,max ) at the range of 350-400 nm. Besides , they displayed a long - wavelength λ a,max at 610-623 nm which is attributable to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the electrondonating dialkoxyphenylene and / or triphenylamine and the electron - withdrawing cyanovinylene 4-nitrophenyl. The three - dimensional configuration of triphenylamine of P1 may restrict the π-conjugation along the polymer backbone as well as the ICT. In contrast , P2 is a fully conjugated copolymer with two electron - withdrawing moieties per repeating unit which favor both π-conjugation and ICT.",

    "sentence": "For this reason , P2 showed lower optical band gap ( E g opt ) than P1. Specifically , the thin film absorption onset is located at 739 and 758 nm corresponding to E g opt of 1.68 and 1.64 eV for P1 and P2 , respectively. These E g opt values are in agreement with those of other related materials containing cyanovinylene 4-nitrophenyls which have been synthesized in our laboratory. 41,42 Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry is often used to measure the redox properties of the copolymers from which their energy levels of HOMO and LUMO are estimated. The HOMO and LUMO levels are estimated from the onset oxidation ( E onset ox ) and reduction ( E onset red ) potentials from the following expressions : 62 E HOMO = -qðE ox þ 4 : 71Þ eV E LUMO = -qðE red þ 4 : 71Þ eV The electrochemical data of both copolymers were obtained from the oxidation and reduction voltammograms as shown in Figure 3 and summarized in Table 1. The electrochemical band gap ( E g elec ) of both copolymers has also been estimated from the difference between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and listed in Table 1. The E g elec values of copolymers are slightly higher than the corresponding optical band gaps , which is probably due to the exciton binding energy of copolymers. 63 It has been generally accepted that an energy difference of 0.3 - 0.4 eV between the LUMO levels of acceptor and donor materials ( i.e. , LUMO - LUMO offset ) used in BHJ layer is necessary for efficient photoinduced electron transfer from polymer to PCBM. 64 Since the LUMO energy level of PCBM has a value ranging between -4.0 and -4.3 eV , 64 the LUMO - LUMO offset between P1 or P2 and PCBM is larger than 0.3 eV , and therefore it is expected that excitons can be easily dissociated at the interface between P1 or P2 and PCBM. Furthermore , the HOMO energy levels of P1 ( -5.2 eV ) and P2 ( -5.3 eV ) are well aligned with the HOMO level of the PEDOT : PSS ( -5.1 eV ) , indicating that holes can be easily transported from the HOMO level of P1 and P2 to PEDOT : PSS. Therefore , both copolymers can be used as electron donors with PCBM as electron acceptor for BHJ PV devices. Electrical and Photovoltaic Properties of Pristine P1 and P2. We have investigated the electrical and photovoltaic properties of single - layer devices based on P1 or P2 , before using these materials as donor component for BHJ photovoltaic devices. Figure 4a,b shows the J-V characteristics of the devices based on pristine P1 and P2 thin films sandwiched between ITO / PEDOT : PSS and Al electrodes , . The J-V characteristics of both devices in dark show a rectification effect when positive potential is applied to ITO / PEDOT : PSS electrode with respect to the Al electrode.",

    "sentence": "Since the HOMO level of PEDOT : PSS is very close to HOMO levels of both P1 and P2 , this electrode behaves as Ohmic contact for hole injection from the PED - OT : PSS - coated ITO electrode into the HOMO of copolymer. However , the LUMO level of both copolymers is very far from the work function of Al ( -4.2 eV ) and forms the Schottky barrier for electron injection from Al into the LUMO level of copolymers. Consequently , the rectification effect is due to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the Al - copolymer layer interface. The charge mobility of the conjugated materials used as photoactive layer in organic PV device is also an important factor , which influences the short circuit current ( J sc ). The hole mobilities of both copolymers were measured using the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method 65 with the device structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / P1 or P2 / Au. The J-V characteristics of the devices were plotted as ln[Jd 3 / ( V app - V bi ) ] vs [ ( V app -V bi ) / d ] 1 / 2 ( where V appl and V bi is the applied voltage and built-in potential , respectively ) and are shown in Figure 5. The hole mobilities of P1 and P2 calculated from the intercepts of corresponding lines are 4.5 x 10^-5 and 2.1 x 10^-5 cm^2 / ( V s ) for P1 and P2 , respectively. These results indicate that both P1 and P2 behave as p - type organic semiconductor with high hole mobility and can be used as electron donor for BHJ devices. The PV parameters of the devices fabricated with P1 and P2 were estimated from the J-V characteristics under illumination , as shown in Figure 4b , and the PV parameters are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen from this table that both J sc and PCE are higher for the device based on P1 as compared to P2 under the same conditions. Since the absorption spectra and the band gap of both copolymers are almost the same , the amount of light absorbed by both copolymers will also be almost the same. This implies that the number of excitons generated in the photoactive layer is the same. Therefore , the higher hole mobility of P1 as compared to P2 , as described earlier , may be responsible for the higher J sc and PCE. The HOMO level of P1 is more aligned with the HOMO level of PEDOT : PSS , indicating that holes can be easily transported from P1 to PEDOT : PSS. However , holes can be trapped at the interface between the P2 and PEDOT : PSS due to the difference in the HOMO levels of P2 and PEDOT : PSS , which causes the slight band bending at the interface.",

Bulk Heterojunction Devices Based on P1 and P2 with PCBM. Before testing the P1 and P2 copolymers as electron donor , with PCBM as acceptor for BHJ devices , photoluminescence ( PL ) measurements were performed to examine the charge transfer efficiency from the copolymer to PCBM. Figure 6 In order to check the PV properties of copolymers P1 and P2 , we fabricated polymer solar cells with the architecture ITO / PEDOT : PSS / P1 or P2 : PCBM / Al , where both P1 and P2 were used as electron donor and PCBM as electron acceptor. The active layer constituted of a copolymer : PCBM blend at various weight ratios , and it was deposited by spincoating on an ITO glass substrate covered by a PEDOT : PSS layer. We found that the optimum copolymer : PCBM weight ratio was around 1 : 1. The J-V characteristics of the PV devices in dark and under illumination of AM 1.5 ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) are shown in Figure 7. Table 3 lists the PV parameters obtained from the J-V characteristics for the best performing devices. The devices fabricated from both copolymers clearly show a rectifying behavior in dark and exhibit significant PV effects under illumination. Our measurements ( Table 3 ) indicate that these devices have a high V oc comparable to that obtained from P3HT : PCBM device ( V oc = 0.55 - 0.60 ). The slight higher value of V oc for device with P2 : PCBM as compared to P1 : PCBM is in agreement with the value of the HOMO levels of P2 and P1 ( Table 1 ) since the V oc is related to the energy difference between the LUMO level of acceptor ( PCBM ) and the HOMO level of the donor ( copolymer ). 66 It can also be seen that the J sc and PCE of the device based on P1 is higher than that to P2. Furthermore , the device based on P1 shows an enhanced fill factor of 0.52. The improvement in J sc and PCE could be ascribed to a more efficient charge separation and transport between P1 and PCBM. Upon comparing , this result could be attributed to the higher energy difference in the LUMO levels of P1 and PCBM as compared to that between P2 and PCBM ( Table 1 ). The devices were also tested for their incident photon to current efficiency ( IPCE ). The values of IPCE have been estimated using the following expression : / ( V app -V bi ) 2 ] vs [ ( V app - V bi ) / d ] 0.5 .",

The IPCE spectra of the devices ( Figure 8 ) show a peak which corresponds to the absorption band of the respective polymers. The similarity of the absorption spectrum with the IPCE response demonstrates that the excitons produced by the absorption of photons in copolymers are dissociated into free charge carriers in the interfaces between P1 or P2 and PCBM in the active layer and subsequently collected by the electrodes. The maximum values of IPCE for P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM based devices are about 54% and 43% , respectively. The IPCE values are consistent with the relatively higher values of J sc and PCE of the P1 : PCBM - based BHJ PV device. The photocurrent in BHJ PV device is determined by the product of the absorbed photons within the solar spectrum and incident quantum efficiency ( IQE ) of the device. 67 As it can be seen from Table 1 and Figure 2 , the optical absorption spectra and band gap of both copolymers are almost similar , indicating that the number of the photons absorbed by the active layer used in both devices is also almost the same. Therefore , the difference in photocurrent in the present devices is attributed to the difference between the IQE of the devices. The IQE is determined by three processes : ( a ) migration and diffusion of photogenerated excitons toward the D / A interface , ( b ) exciton dissociation and charge separation at the interfaces , and ( c ) collection of charge carriers by the collecting electrodes. The process \" a \" depends upon the nanoscale phase separation between the donor and acceptor materials used in the BHJ active layer. The AFM images of the P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM are similar , which indicates that both blends have the same nanoscale phase separation. For process \" b \" , a sufficient large energy difference between the LUMO of donor and acceptor material is required for ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer. As can be seen from Table 1 , this difference is higher for P1 : PCBM as compared to P2 : PCBM , resulting in higher IQE for the device based on the former blend. The process \" c \" depends upon the percolated path of electrons and holes in the BHJ active layer and also on the position of HOMO and LUMO levels of donor and acceptor materials , respectively , relative to the work function of anode and the cathode. The HOMO level of P1 is closer to the HOMO level of PEDOT : PSS , which results in a more efficient collection of holes.",

The hole mobility for P1 is higher than that for P2 which leads to the enhanced PCE for this device. We have also investigated the effect of thermal annealing on the PV response of the BHJ devices using both P1 and P2. The J-V characteristics under illumination and IPCE spectra of the devices are shown in Figures 7 and 8 , respectively. The overall PCE for the devices based on thermally annealed P1 and P2 are 4.06% and 3.35% , respectively. The increase in the IPCE and J sc of the devices based on the thermally annealed blends is attributed to the increase in the crystallinity of the blend and the hole mobility in the copolymer phase upon thermal annealing. This can be ascribed to an effective formation of phase - separated structure induced by thermal annealing , which leads to a better connectivity of each phase. Charge carrier mobilities in donor - acceptor BHJ thin films play an important role on the performance of the organic PV devices. After the photoinduced charge transfer at the D-A interfaces presented in the bulk of the photoactive layer of the devices , the electrons are localized in the PCBM phase and holes remain in the copolymer phase , i.e. , P1 or P2 in the present cases. Subsequently , the free electrons and holes must be transported via percolated PCBM and copolymer pathways toward Al and PEDOT : PSS / ITO electrodes , respectively , in order to produce the photocurrent. Therefore , the electron transport in PCBM and hole transport in copolymer are crucial for understanding the photogeneration process in BHJ devices. We have also investigated the effect of thermal annealing on the charge carrier mobility as reported earlier in the literature for P3HT : PCBM blends. The electron and hole mobilities in the BHJ thin film layer can be determined from the J-V measurements using appropriate electrodes which suppress the injection of either electrons or holes , resulting in hole and electron only devices , respectively. We have measured the dark J-V characteristics of P1 : PCBM blends for hole only and electron only devices using both as cast and thermally annealed blends.

The charge carrier mobilities of both P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM blend films were evaluated by space charge limited current ( SCLC ) measurements. 65 The hole mobilities for both the as cast P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM are quite comparable with the value measured for pristine copolymers.",

    "sentence": "However , the values of hole mobilities are about 1.3 x 10^-4 and 8.4 x 10^-5 cm^2 / ( V s ) for the annealed P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM , respectively. The electron mobility for the as-cast and annealed blends is almost the same. The enhanced hole mobility leads to a balanced charge transport in the BHJ PV device. We have also investigated the morphologies of P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM blends to get information about the average surface roughness for the film , using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). The AFM images for the as-cast and thermally annealed P1 : PCBM blends are shown in Figure 9. Similar images have been also obtained for P2 : PCBM. The as-cast P1 : PCBM blend forms smooth film with an average surface roughness 1.2 nm. Upon thermal annealing of the P1 : PCBM film at 100 °C , the average surface roughness increases to ∼ 1.8 nm. It can be seen from these images that thermal annealing results in significant changes in the surface morphology. The surface domain size has also been increased upon thermal annealing. This indicates that both the increased domain size and average surface roughness result in an improvement in the crystallinity of the blend , which is responsible for the enhancement in the PCE due to the more efficient photoinduced charge at the D / A interfaces. Thin film XRD patterns were used to determine the difference in the crystallinity of the P1 : PCBM blended films ( as-cast and thermally annealed ) and are shown in Figure 10. Similar results have also been observed for P2 : CBM. It can be seen in Figure 10 that the as-cast film exhibits a peak centered at 2θ = 7.8 ° , which corresponds to the interplanar distance of 7.8 Å . The thermal annealing leads to higher peak intensity , indicating a higher degree of crystallinity. Since most of the fullerene acceptors , such as PCBM , do not show any diffraction peak in the range of 2θ values used , 68 the change in the crystallinity of the blended thin film after thermal annealing is mainly attributed to an increase in crystalline domains of the copolymer donor material. The increase in the crystalline nature of P1 : PCBM or P2 : PCBM after thermal annealing is mainly caused by the copolymer chains self - organization , into an ordered structure , as has been recently reported for P3HT : PCBM blend. The crystallization of copolymer also improves the light - harvesting property by extending the conjugation length. 69 The increase in the crystallinity of copolymer P1 or P2 in their respective blends with PCBM upon thermal annealing leads to an improvement in the hole mobility that increases the overall PCE . Two novel alternating phenylenevinylene copolymers P1 and P2 were successfully synthesized. They showed enhanced solubility being soluble in common organic solvents.",

The electrochemical data of both P1 and P2 indicate that these copolymers are suitable as electron donor with PCBM as acceptor for efficient BHJ PV devices. The BHJ PV devices based on the as cast P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM show an overall PCE about 3.15% and 2.60% , respectively. The higher values of PCE for the device based on P1 : PCBM relative to P2 : PCBM is due to the more efficient photoinduced charge transfer and higher value of hole mobility for P1. Further enhancement in PCE ( 4.06% and 3.35% for P1 : PCBM and P2 : PCBM , respectively ) with thermally annealed blends is attributed to the increase in hole mobility in the blend due to the improved crystalline nature of the blend. The above results suggest that the balance charge transport and improve crystallinity of the blend are the key factors for efficient collection of charge transport in the PV devices .",

Stille coupling copolymerization gave copolymers having moderate number - average molecular weights of 17.0 - 18.5 kDa with polydispersities of 3.3 - 4.0 and optical band gaps of 1.22 - 1.38 eV. High performance p-channel field - effect transistors were obtained using the thiazolothiazole - linked copolymers , PDPTT and PDPTTOx , giving hole mobilities of 0.5 and 1.2 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively , with on / off current ratios of 10^5 to 10^6 . In contrast , the benzobisthiazole - linked copolymer PDPBT had a substantially lower field - effect mobility of holes ( 0.005 cm^2 / ( V s ) ) due to its amorphous solid state morphology. Bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated by using one of the thiazolothiazole - linked copolymer , PDPTT , as electron donor and PC71BM acceptor show a power conversion efficiency of 3.4% under 100 mW / cm^2 AM1.5 irradiation in air . Solution - processable conjugated polymers are of growing interest for the development of large area and printable fieldeffect transistors 1-13 and low - cost solar cells. 14-22 Although remarkable progress has been made in the design and synthesis of p - type polymer semiconductors , their performance in terms of hole mobilities and photovoltaic properties remains to be fully optimized and maximized. An important approach in the development of p - type polymer semiconductors is the donor- acceptor ( D-A ) copolymer architecture , which by virtue of its modular nature can facilitate the tuning of absorption bands , charge carrier mobilities , and HOMO / LUMO energy levels , depending on the choice of the electron - donating ( D ) and electron - accepting segments ( A ). 23 Among recent examples of D-A copolymers found to be good p - type semiconductors for developing high performance field - effect transistors include those containing donor moieties such as thienothiophene 10a,11b and cyclopentadithiophene 3a and acceptors such as diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) , 8-11 thiazolothiazole ( TT ) , 12 and benzothiadiazole ( BTz ). 3a Further fine - tuning of the electronic structure and charge transport properties can be facilitated by the D-A copolymer architecture by the utilization of two or more different acceptor or donor units in the backbone : ( D- A 1 -D-A 2 -D ) or ( A-D 1 -A-D 2 -A ). This strategy is exemplified by copolymers incorporating both DPP and benzothiadiazole as the electron - deficient acceptor units , resulting in high mobility ambipolar charge transport in the copolymer semiconductors. 7c,e D-A copolymers incorporating DPP and oligothiophene segments have been extensively studied and found to have broad absorption bands in the UV - vis / near-IR region , low optical band gaps , enhanced π-π stacking / crystallinity , and high charge carrier mobilities.",

The new D-A conjugated polymers were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization of distannane comonomer 2 or 3 17a or 4 18a and 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2yl)-2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione ( 1 ) in the presence of Pd 2 dba 3 and P(tol) 3 as catalyst and ligand , respectively , in anhydrous chlorobenzene ( Scheme 1 ). Copolymers PDPTT and PDPTTOx were highly soluble ( 10- 15 mg / mL ) in common organic solvents such as chloroform , tetrahydrofuran , chlorobenzene , and 1,2-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. However , PDPBT which contains benzobisthiazole rings was soluble ( 8-10 mg / mL ) in chloroform at room temperature but only soluble in chlorobenzene and 1,2dichlorobenzene at high temperatures ( 60-100 ° C ). The molecular weight ( M n and M w ) and polydispersity index ( PDI = M w / M n ) of the copolymers were obtained by performing gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) relative to polystyrene standards in chlorobenzene at 60 ° C. The copolymers had moderate number - average molecular weight ( M n ) that varied from 17.0 kDa in PDPTTOx and 18.0 kDa in PDPTT to 18.5 kDa in PDPBT. The weight - average molecular weight was also comparable for the three copolymers ( M w = 59.4 - 66.6 kDa ) as was the PDI of 3.3 - 4.0. The molecular weight of these copolymers could probably be increased further by optimization of the polymerization conditions such as the monomer concentration in solution , catalyst / ligand ratio , and temperature. The thermal behavior of the thiazole-diketopyrrolopyrrole copolymers was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ). The copolymers showed onset thermal decomposition temperatures ( T d ) in the range of 378-396 ° C under N 2 , showed that there is no glass or melt transitions in this temperature range ( Figure S2 ). 3.2. Optical Properties. The normalized optical absorption spectra of copolymers PDPBT , PDPTT , and PDPTTOx in dilute chloroform solutions ( ∼ 10^-6 M ) and as thin films are shown in Figure 1. In both solutions and thin films , all the three copolymers are characterized by a broad absorption band that extends from ∼ 500 to 900-1000 nm. This absorption band appears to originate from the strong intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) interactions between the acceptor and donor moieties.",

    "sentence": "23 In dilute solution , the thiazolothiazole - linked copolymer , PDPTT , showed an absorption maximum ( λ max ) at 736 nm and vibronic shoulder at 688 nm ( Figure 1a ). The thin film absorption spectrum has a similar line shape except that the absorption maximum is at 749 nm with a vibronic shoulder at 688 nm , resulting in an absorption edge optical band gap ( E g opt ) of 1.38 eV. In solution , PDPTTOx has a broad absorption with a maximum centered at 794 nm , which red - shifts to 818 nm in thin film and results in an optical band gap of 1.22 eV. This large red - shift in the absorption maximum ( ∼ 69 nm ) of PDPTTOx compared to PDPTT films arises from the strong electron - donating nature of its octyloxy side chains. The absorption spectra of the benzobisthiazole - linked copolymer , PDPBT , in solution and as a thin film were nearly identical to those of PDPTT , showing an optical band gap ( E g opt ) of 1.33 eV ( Table 1 ). The similarity of the optical absorption spectra of PDPTT and PDPBT suggest that the intramolecular charge transfer interactions in PDPTT are not significantly altered when the secondary electron - accepting moiety is changed from thiazolothiazole to benzobisthiazole. 3.3. Redox Properties and HOMO / LUMO Energy Levels. The electronic ( HOMO / LUMO ) energy levels of the D-A copolymers were estimated from cyclic voltammetry. 25 Oxidation and reduction cyclic voltammograms ( CVs ) of the copolymers are shown in Figure 2. The onset oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) potentials are summarized in Table 1. All the copolymers showed irreversible oxidation waves as shown in Figure 2a. The onset oxidation potentials ( E ox onset ) of copolymers PDPBT , PDPTT , and PDPTTOx are 0.91 , 0.81 , and 0.74 V , respectively , from which the HOMO levels are estimated ( E HOMO = eE ox onset + 4.4 ) to be 5.31 , 5.21 , and 5.14 eV , respectively ( Table 1 ). The 0.1 - 0.2 eV lower lying HOMO energy level of PDPBT compared with the other copolymers can be understood to come from the weaker electron - accepting ability of benzobisthiazole unit. 12b,13 The observed HOMO energy levels of 5.14 - 5.31 eV suggest that hole injection into these copolymers could be optimum from high work function electrodes such as gold ( φ = 5.1 eV ). 26 The reduction waves seen in the CVs of the D-A copolymers were also irreversible as shown in Figure 2b. The onset reduction potential ( E red onset ) of the copolymers was quite similar in the range of -0.8 to -0.9 V , irrespective of whether there is thiazolothiazole or benzobisthiazole linkage in the backbone.",

    "sentence": "From this , the LUMO energy level was calculated ( E LUMO = eE red onset + 4.4 ) to be 3.50 - 3.60 eV ( Table 1 ). This value of the LUMO energy level suggests that electron injection into the copolymers may not be feasible from gold electrodes. Electron 5b or ambipolar 2b charge transport could thus be ruled out in these copolymers. The electrochemical band gap ( E g el = E ox onset -E red onset ) was found to be 1.61 - 1.83 eV , which is much larger than the observed 1.22 - 1.38 eV optical band gap. The discrepancy of 0.2 - 0.5 eV in the measured electrochemical and optical band gaps could be due to the exciton binding energy 27 of the polymer thin films. 3.4. Morphology of Copolymer Films. To provide further insight into the morphology of the copolymers , X-ray diffraction measurement was performed on drop - cast films ( from 10 mg / mL solutions in 1,2-dichlorobenzene ) deposited onto a glass substrate , annealed at 180 °C for 10 min. Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns of PDPBT , PDPTT , and PDPTTOx films. Weak diffraction peaks corresponding to a d-spacing of 2.1 and 2.5 nm due to the ( 100 ) lamellar reflections were observed for the thiazolothiazole - linked copolymers PDPTT and PDPTTOx , respectively , indicating relatively weak crystallinity in the thin films. These results reveal that there is no significant effect on morphology of the thiazolothiazolelinked copolymers , when branched ethylhexyl side chains on the thiophene rings of PDPTT were replaced by linear octyloxy side chains of PDPTTOx. On the other hand , the XRD pattern of benzobisthiazole - linked PDPBT , which has the large benzobisthiazole linkage and linear dodecyl side chains , did not show diffraction peaks , indicating that PDPBT film is far more disordered in the solid state. 3.5. Organic Field - Effect Transistors ( OFETs ). The charge transport properties of the new copolymer semiconductors were investigated by fabricating and characterizing organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) with bottom-gate and top - contact ( BGTC ) geometry and gold source / drain electrodes. Uniform films of PDPTT and PDPTTOx were easily deposited onto the OTS8 - treated , hydrophobic , SiO 2 dielectric substrate by spin - coating from a solution in a high-boiling-point solvent , 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( bp = 181 °C ). However , because of the poor wetting of PDPBT solution in 1,2-dichlorobenzene on the hydrophobic OTS8 / SiO 2 substrate , we instead used chloroform ( bp = 61 °C ) solution to fabricate PDPBT OFETs. The thickness of the polymer semiconductor layer in the OFETs was 80-100 nm. Figure 4 shows the output curves and transfer characteristics of the OFETs based on PDPTTOx , PDPTT , and PDPBT. Each of the three copolymer semiconductors exhibited unipolar p-channel field - effect transistor characteristics.",

    "sentence": "High current modulation was observed with on / off current ratio ( I on / I off ) of 10^5 -10^6 for the thiazolothiazole - linked copolymers , PDPTTOx and PDPTT. In the case of the benzobisthiazole - linked copolymer , PDPBT , the on / off current ratio was slightly lower at 10^4 -10^5 . n-Channel operation was not observed for any of the new copolymers , and thus there is no evidence of electron transport characteristics from the given device architecture. The unipolar p - type characteristics of the presented copolymers is due to the suitable HOMO energy levels ( -5.1 to -5.3 eV ) for hole injection and transport and rather high - lying LUMO energy levels ( -3.5 to -3.6 eV ) , which presents a significant barrier for electron injection and transport. It is to be noted that some DPP - based D-A copolymer semiconductors exhibit ambipolar field - effect charge transport 5c,6b,7a,e while others exhibit unipolar p-channel fieldeffect charge transport. 8a,10a Hole mobility ( μ h ) and threshold voltage ( V t ) were calculated from the plots of square root of the drain current ( |I ds | 1 / 2 ) with respect to the gate voltage ( V gs ) in the saturation region , as shown in Figure 4b,d,f. The thiazolothiazole - linked polymers , PDPTTOx and PDPTT , have a high hole mobility of 1.2 and 0.5 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively. This carrier mobility is comparable to that of recently reported high mobility unipolar p - type polymer semiconductors. 8a PDPBT , the benzobisthiazole - linked copolymer , on the other hand , has a rather low hole mobility of 0.005 cm^2 / ( V s ). The origin of the orders of magnitude ( 100-300 × ) smaller carrier mobility in PDPBT thin films , compared to the thiazolothiazole - linked polymers PDPTT and PDPTTOx , is not obvious given the similarity in molecular weight ( Table 1 ) , molecular weight polydispersity , and HOMO-LUMO energy levels. A possible explanation of the large difference in carrier mobility between the thiazolothiazole (TT)-linked copolymers and the benzobisthiazole (BT)-linked one is the large mismatch in the size between BT and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) and thus poor solid state molecular packing and crystallinity in the case of PDPBT. The electrical parameters , including the average hole mobility ( μ h ) , the threshold voltage ( V t ) , and the on / off current ratio , of the OFETs are summarized in Table 2. One of the interesting features of PDPTTOx and PDPTT OFETs is the gate voltage ( V gs ) dependence of the hole mobility. PDPTTOx OFETs showed higher field - effect mobility of > 1 cm^2 / ( V s ) when the gate voltage is in the range of -35 to -45 V. As |V gs | further increases , the mobility decreases to 0.2 - 0.5 cm^2 / ( V s ). PDPTT OFETs also showed a similar behavior.",

    "sentence": "Higher mobility ( > 0.4 cm^2 / ( V s ) ) was observed when V gs is in the range of -50 to -60 V , whereas the mobility decreases to ∼ 0.1 cm^2 / ( V s ) with higher |V gs |. Such a large V gs dependence of field - effect mobility in polymer OFETs has also been reported and attributed to contact effects. 28 PDPBT OFETs did not show such a gate - voltage dependence. 3.6. Photovoltaic Properties. We investigated the photovoltaic properties of the thiazole-DPP copolymer : PC71BM blends by fabricating and characterizing bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells that have the basic device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / LiF / Al. The active layer is a spincoated film composed of thiazole-DPP copolymer : PC71BM blend with an optimal weight ratio of 1 : 2 and processed with 2.5 vol % 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) and 97.5 vol % 1,2- dichlorobenzene. The solar cells were fabricated in a glovebox and tested under AM1.5 solar illumination at 1 sun ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) in ambient air. The current density (J)-voltage ( V ) curves for the devices are shown in Figure 5a. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices , including the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) , the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , and fill factor ( FF ) , are collected in Table 3. A significant decrease in V oc of the BHJ solar cells is seen as the donor is changed from PDPBT ( 0.71 V ) to PDPTT ( 0.70 V ) and to PDPTTOx ( 0.52 V ). The decrease in V oc can be partially understood by considering the decreasing energy offset between the donor HOMO and acceptor ( LUMO ) 29 as one goes from PDPBT to PDPTTOx. In addition , the nanoscale phase - separated morphology of the donor / acceptor blend , which influences the charge photogeneration and charge carrier recombination , may also affect the observed V oc in the solar cells. 30 On the other hand , J sc shows an increasing trend , changing from 6.79 mA / cm^2 in PDPBT : PC71BM to 8.31 mA / cm^2 in PDPTTOx : PC71BM blends. This variation in J sc can in part be explained on the basis of the relative difference in the charge carrier mobilities of PDPTT , PDPTTOx , and PDPBT. Solar cells made from PDPTT : PC71BM combine a high fill factor of 0.60 with a high V oc ( 0.7 ) and moderate short - circuit current density ( 8.03 mA / cm^2 ) , resulting in a photovoltaic efficiency of 3.4% PCE. The photovoltaic efficiency of the other copolymers ( PDPBT and PDPTTOx ) was lower at 2.2 - 2.7% PCE. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectrum or action spectrum of each thiazole-DPP copolymer : PC71BM blend solar cell system is shown in Figure 5b.",

    "sentence": "The photoresponse of the photodiodes turned on at near-IR wavelengths ( 900-1000 nm ) , demonstrating light harvesting of the near-IR photons due to the small band gaps of the thiazole-DPP copolymers. The photoresponse of PDPTTOx : PC71BM blends in particular begins at ∼ 1000 nm , showing a higher EQE in the wavelength range of 800-1000 nm compared to the other copolymers in the series. This may also partly explain the observed enhanced J sc in PDPTTOx : PC71BM solar cells. The J sc calculated from the EQE spectra was 6.43 mA / cm^2 for PDPBT : PC71BM , 7.62 mA / cm^2 for PDPTT : PC71BM , and 7.68 mA / cm^2 for PDPTTOx : PC71BM. These J sc values calculated from the EQE spectra are 5-8 % lower than the J sc values obtained in direct J-V measurement due to spectral mismatch between the simulated light source and the AM1.5 solar spectrum and possibly also due to degradation of solar cells during measurement in air. We used bright - field transmission electron microscope ( BF - TEM ) imaging to investigate the nanomorphology of the thiazole-DPP copolymer : PC71BM blend thin films peeled off directly from the solar cells whose photovoltaic properties are discussed above. The images shown in Figure 6 were acquired at a slightly defocused condition to enhance the phase contrast between the polymer and fullerene , and under this focusing condition , fullerene domains appear darker than polymer domains due to the higher density of the fullerene. The copolymer : PC71BM blend films all showed a bicontinuous nanomorphology , with well - woven copolymer nanowire networks embedded in the fullerene matrix. For example , TEM images of PDPTT : PC71BM blend films showed copolymer nanowires with width of 16-18 nm and length of several hundred nanometers 19b and interconnected fullerene domains with size of ∼ 100-200 nm. Selected area electron diffraction ( SAED ) patterns shown as inset of Figure 6 indicated that the copolymers and PC71BM formed semicrystalline domains , as shown by the Debye - Scherrer diffraction rings. 19c New donor - acceptor copolymers containing both a strong electron - accepting diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) moiety and a weak electron - accepting thiazolothiazole or benzobisthiazole moiety have been synthesized with moderate number - average molecular weights ( 17.0 - 18.5 kDa ) with polydispersity indexes of 3.3 - 4.0. The new thiazolothiazole-diketopyrrolopyrrole copolymers , PDPTT and PDPTTOx , were found to be unipolar p - type semiconductors , exhibiting a high carrier mobility of 0.5 and 1.2 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively , and excellent on / off current ratio ( > 10^5 ) in field - effect transistors. Bulk heterojunction solar cells incorporating blends of the copolymers with PC71BM had power conversion efficiencies of 2.2 - 3.4% . TEM imaging of the copolymer : PC71BM blend thin films showed that the copolymers self - assembled into nanowires of 16-18 nm width and length of several hundred nanometers.",

Compared to previously reported CSC - PTs , side chain isolated PT5TPA showed red- shifted and enhanced π-π* transition absorption of the polymer backbone along with the shoulder peak and steep absorption edge , indicating improved planarity of the backbone. In addition , the unsubstituted thiophene spacer along the polymer backbone of the side chain isolated PT5TPA results in a lower HOMO energy level of the polymer at -5.1 eV.

The results indicate that the side chain isolated CSC - PTs could open a new way for developing high performance photovoltaic polymers . Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on p - type conjugated polymers as donor 1,2 and n - type fullerene 3,4 as acceptor have been intensively studied in recent years for the generation of affordable , clean , and renewable energy. 5 Advantages of the BHJ PSCs include low - cost fabrication of large - area devices , light weight , mechanical flexibility , and easy tunability of chemical properties of the photovoltaic materials. 6 Poly(thiophene) derivatives ( PTs ) have been among the most extensively investigated conjugated polymers due to their high charge carrier mobility , strong absorption in visible region and synthetic accessibility. 7-12 Soluble poly(3-alkylthiophene)s , especially regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , are the most important semiconducting polymers for the application in PSCs. 9-12 However , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSCs based on P3HT as donor and PCBM as acceptor is limited at 4-5 % , 13,14 because of its larger band gap and its high HOMO ( the highest occupied molecular orbital ) energy level , which result in limited light absorption and a low open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the PSCs. In addition , the high regioregularityinduced crystallization may be an issue of thermal instability of the blend of P3HT and fullerene acceptors. For broadening the absorption of the PTs , the polythiophene derivatives with conjugated side chain ( CSC - PTs , where CSC represents \" conjugated side chain \" ) were designed and synthesized in our group. 15-17 The CSC - PTs possess 2-D charge transport properties thanks to the 2-D - conjugated character of the polymer structure , and broad absorptions deriving from both the main chains and conjugated side chains ; thus , this family of CSC - PTs demonstrated good device performances in PSCs 15a and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ).",

    "sentence": "16 However , due to steric hindrance of the large conjugated side chain with other alkyl side chains on the polymer main chain , the CSC - PTs showed poorer planarity , which is detrimental for the close packing of polymer chains in the solid state , as clearly evidenced for the featureless absorption along with the low absorption intensity of π-π* absorption. 15-17 As a result , this structural limitation constrains their application in organic electronics and the highest PCE value of the CSC - PTs reported so far was 3.18% . 15a To further improve the optical properties , creating the CSC - PTs without scarifying the planarity / conjugation of the thiophene backbone is very desirable. Fulfilling this goal presents serious challenges in chemistry. To address this issue , here we proposed the \" side chain isolation \" concept in designing the new CSC - PTs. We selected styryl-triphenylamine ( TPA ) as the conjugated side chain in considering the high hole mobility and good solubility of the TPA unit , and we used a tetrathiophene unit without side chains as the spacer between the thiophene units with the conjugated side chains for avoiding the steric hindrance of the side chains. In addition , two 2-ethylhexyloxyl groups were directly attached at the terminal of the TPA side chains to ensure good solubility. According to the molecular mechanics simulation ( performed with COMPASS force field within the Materials Studio Package 18 ) as shown in Figure 1 , the sidechains of PT5TPA oriented in the tail - to - tail direction are spaced approximately 13 Å apart while those side chains orientated in the head - to - tail fashions are 20 Å apart. Thus , this side chain isolation approach combines the thiophene units bearing conjugated side chain and the unsubstituted tetrathienyl spacers to reduce the steric interactions between the neighbor side chains , which lessens the torsion of the main chains ( see Figure 1b ). This CSC-PT of PT5TPA demonstrated red - shifted and enhanced π-π* transition absorption of the polymer backbone along with the shoulder peak and steep absorption edge , indicating some ordered aggregation of the polymer backbone. In addition , the polymer shows a lower HOMO energy level at -5.1 eV. The PSC based on PT5TPA as donor and indene-C 60 bisadduct ( IC 60 BA ) 4 as acceptor displayed a PCE of 3.6% with a high open circuit voltage of 0.94 V , under the illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2 .

    "sentence": "Chemical structure and synthetic route of PT5TPA with TPA-vinylene conjugated side chain are depicted in Schemes 1. . The polymer is soluble in chlorinated solvents , such as chloroform , chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene , and exhibited a numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) of 180.9 K , with a polydispersity index of 3.2. Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure S1 in Supporting Information ( SI ) , demonstrated a good thermal stability of the polymer with a 5% weight - loss temperature at 354 ° C. DSC was measured in the temperature range of 30-280 ° C , but we did not find the glass transition temperature in the temperature range. ( see Figure S2 in Supporting Information ). Optical and Electrochemical Properties. Figure 2a shows the absorption spectra of PT5TPA solution in chloroform and film on quartz plate , together with the absorption spectrum of PT2TPA film 16a ( PT2TPA is a PT5TPA-analogue polymer with only one thiophene spacer , named as OTPAV-PT in ref 16a ). The solution and film absorption of PT5TPA display similar broad absorption band from 300 to 650 nm with three distinct absorption peaks. The two weak absorption peaks around 303 and 413 nm originate respectively from n-π* transition of TPA group 22 and the absorption of the thiophene units with the conjugated side chain , while the maximum absorption of the copolymer at 555 nm corresponds to the π-π* transition of the polymer backbone. Thus , both the main chain and side chain contribute to the broad nature of the absorption spectra of the polymer , which is a common feature for PTs with conjugated side chains. 15,16 Because of an enlarged π-system , the film absorption of PT5TPA is red - shifted by ca. 10 nm than that of P3HT. The absorption edge of the polymer film is at 658 nm , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.88 eV. The similarity of solution absorption to film absorption suggests strong π-π interactions ( aggregation ) in solution. As shown in Figure 2a , when the polymer solution was heated to 85 °C , the absorption peaks blue shift , and the shoulder peak at ca. 600 nm weakened , reflecting partial disaggregation of the polymer backbone at high temperature. Also it must mention that the obtained high molecular weight of PT5TPA could be overestimated due to the easily formed polymer aggregation state at room temperature. In comparison with the absorption spectrum of PT2TPA film 16a as also shown in Figure 2a , the π-π* absorption of PT5TPA main chains at ca. 500-650 nm is greatly enhanced than that of the CSC - PTs with concentrated side chains. 15-17 Obviously , the side chain isolated PT5TPA can minimize the steric interactions between the neighboring side chains , thus preserving backbone planarity , which results in the red - shifted and enhanced π-π* transition of the polymer backbone along with the shoulder peak and steep absorption edge.",

    "sentence": "Furthermore , the well - defined spectra of PT5TPA imply an ordered polymer chains and densely packed side chains in the polymer film , which should benefit to higher hole mobility and photovoltaic performance of the polymer. In order to further investigate the ordered structure of the polymer , we measured X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) of the polymer film on Si substrate. The XRD pattern of the polymer film ( see Figure S7 in Supporting Information ) indicates that the polymer film is still in amorphous state although the aggregation is enhanced in the polymer. The hole mobility of PT5TPA film was measured to be 1.1 × 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) by space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method ( see Figure S3 in Supporting Information ) , confirming the relatively higher hole mobility of the polymer. Figure 2b shows the photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of PT5TPA solution in dichlorobenzene and film , excited at 430 nm , which is the maximum absorption wavelength of the conjugated side chains of the polymer. PT5TPA shows deep red main chain emission peaked at 670 nm. The results indicate that quick and complete energy transfer occurs from the conjugated side chains to the polymer main chains after the conjugated side chains absorb the photons. This phenomenon ensures that all photons absorbed by the polymer are useful for the photovoltaic conversion. The electronic energy levels of the conjugated polymers can be measured from the onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials of the cyclic voltammograms ( CVs ). 23 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram of PT5TPA together with that of P3HT for comparison and that of ferrocene for potential calibration. The redox potential of ferrocene is 0.09 V vs Ag / Ag + . On the basis of 4.8 eV below vacuum for the energy level of Fc / Fc + , the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the unit of E ox onset is V vs. Ag / Ag + . The onset oxidation potential ( E ox onset ) and onset reduction potential ( E red onset ) of PT5TPA are 0.39 and -1.63 V vs. Ag / Ag + respectively , accordingly , the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PT5TPA were calculated to be -5.10 and -3.08 eV respectively. Compared to that of P3HT , the onset oxidation potential of PT5TPA is positively shifted by ca. 0.2 V and the HOMO energy level of PT5TPA is downward shifted by ca. 0.2 eV , which is due to less alkyl substituents of PT5TPA than that of P3HT. 12b The lower HOMO energy level relative to P3HT can provide better air stability in ambient conditions and higher open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the PSCs with PT5TPA as donor materials because the V oc is usually proportional to the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor. 6 Photovoltaic Properties.",

Although the PCE of 3.6% is lower than that of the PSC based on P3HT / IC 60 BA , 4 it is the highest value reported so far for the CSC - PTs. In the PSCs based on PT5TPA , the FF values ( Table 1 ) are significantly improved in comparison with the CSC - PTs with concentrated side chains , 15,16,17f,24 which could be ascribed to the close aggregation of the polymer main chains in the side chain isolated polymers . A design concept of \" side chain isolation \" was proposed for CSC - PTs , and a planar CSC-PT , PT5TPA , with styryl- triphenylamine ( TPA ) side chains and unsubstituted tetrathienyl spacer was designed and synthesized. Compared to previously reported CSC - PTs , side chain isolated PT5TPA demonstrated the red - shifted and enhanced π-π* transition absorption of the polymer backbone along with the shoulder peak and steep absorption edge.

The two copolymers exhibit lower - lying HOMO energy level and closer interchains packing than their analogue with alkyl side chains attributed to the more polarizable S atom inducing stronger intermolecular interactions. Of these two polymers , PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 with linear alkylthio side chains shows closer molecules stacking with PC71BM than PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH with branched akylthio side chains. As a result , the polymer solar cell based on the blend of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 and PC71BM got a higher PCE of 8.51% than that based on PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PC71BM , which was only 7.02% . More importantly , both two copolymers shown higher photovoltaic performances in as-casting devices than in which treated by additive or thermal annealing because an appropriate bulk morphology was formed during process of the spin - casting due to strong interchain interactions of the polymers , which eliminates the need of solvent additives or thermal annealing . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted increasing attention due to their potential advantages of low cost , light weight , capability to be fabricated into flexible devices and easily realize roll - to - roll manufacturing. Nowadays , owing to development on molecule designing , device fabricating and principle studying , the power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of PSCs have been well improved. The single - junction bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs have achieved PCEs over 10% [1][2][3][4][5]. In many reported BHJ PSCs , post solvent and thermal annealing are important methods for improving the organic solar cells ( OSCs ) performance. But the residual solvent additives in the BHJ films will act as hole traps [6]. And additives , such as 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) , will significantly reduce the device stability [7][8][9]. Therefore , devices after using additives should be treated by a secondary process to remove the additives [7,8]. However , considering manufacturing challenges for future commercialization of solar cells , it is necessary to remove extra processes such as adding solvent additives and thermal annealing so that facilitating the processing and reducing the cost of production. Thus , designing and synthesizing novel polymer materials that exhibited high solar cell performance using simpler processing methods are highly desired. In designing molecule , a widely used strategy is to construct electron donor - acceptor ( D-A ) type of alternating copolymers with narrow bandgaps. Through the combination of different electron donor ( D ) units and acceptor ( A ) units , the energy levels , absorption spectra and many other characteristics of the copolymers can be easily tuned. In addition , introduction of different side chains into the copolymers can further adjust precisely the physical characters of copolymers such as solubility , light absorption , molecular packing , energy level , charge transport , etc. Up to now , flexible alkyl groups are widely used side chains in tuning the basic properties of the copolymers.",

    "sentence": "The polymers with branched alkyl side chain generally exhibit higher solubility while the polymers analogues with linear alkyl side chains show closer intermolecule packing and higher charge mobilities [10][11][12][13][14]. Also , recent studies demonstrated that alkylthio side chains offer prominent advantages over their alkyl analogues. This is due to the sulfur atom with higher polarizability than carbon atom and form p π (C)-d π ( S ) orbital overlap where divalent sulfur atom accepts π-electron from the aromatic group into its empty 3d-orbitals [15,16]. In that case , conjugated molecules substituted by alkylthio groups could exhibit unique optoelectronic properties. For example , Huoet al. [17] replaced the alkyl side chains of the poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) with alkylthio side chains , and the resultant poly[ (3hexylthio)thiophene ] ( P3HST ) exhibited the red - shifted max absorption peak and slightly lower the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , therefore resulting a higher open - circuit voltage ( V oc ). Li et al. [18] and Price et al. [19] found that the alkylthio side chain of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b ' ]dithiophene ( BDT ) unit enhanced V oc and PCE of the relative device compared to its alkyl analogue , although the HOMO level almost unchanged. Also , in the works of Chen et al. [20,21] , the HOMO and max absorption peak of oligomers showed little changes and V oc was not improved by introducing the alkythio side chains , but both short - circuit current density ( J sc ) and PCE increased because of a better morphology. The most exciting results for alkylthio groups were achieved when they are linked to the conjugated side chains of copolymers. For example , Li et al. [16] introduced branched alkylthio substituents into the conjugated side chains of BDT unit , and a high PCE of 8.42% was achieved for the device based on the resulting copolymer PBDTT-S-TT which is associated with its low - lying HOMO and extended absorption spectra. Based on the same copolymer , Ye et al. [22] synthesized a copolymer PBDT - TS1 by replacing branched alkylthio side chains with linear ones , and PCE of the relative device was further improved to 9.48% . These reports indicated that using alkylthio groups to replace alkyl side chains of the polymers would improve photovoltaic performance , though the conclusion about the effects of the alkylthio side chains on HOMO level , J sc and V oc obtained in those literatures were a little different. In addition , Yang , et al. [23,24] found that some low-E g D-A type of polymers , such as PBDTT - DPP , PDPP3T , and PDTP - DFBT , usually do not require DIO to achieve moderate cell performance , because these polymers can form a good nanoscalebicontinuous phase separation with PC71BM spontaneously.",

    "sentence": "It is generally believed that these low-E g polymers possess a stronger interchain interaction , thus appropriate bulk BHJ morphology can be formed during the spin - casting or perhaps as early as in solution state , which allows these polymers to achieve high device performance without having to use post-solvent and thermal annealing steps. This indicates that adjusting the interchain interaction to increase aggregation propensity of the polymers would be an effective strategy to get rid of additives or thermal annealing steps. Following this design concept , Yang et al. [25] recently synthesized a polymer PBDTSe-TT through selenium substitution on the PTB7 - polymer. PBDTSe-TT possesses enhanced π-π interaction between molecules brought by selenium atom , therefore achieved high performance of 8.8% PCE without any additives. In the same time , Yue , et al. [26] reported a 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,6-dicarboxylic imide based polymer , and Nielsen , et al. [27] reported thieno [3,2b] [1]benzothiopheneisoindigo based polymers also demonstrated the same cell behaviors as PBDTSe-TT because of their strong intermolecular interaction. Our group has been working toward developing new D-A conjugated photovoltaic polymers. Very recently , we reported a series of D-A copolymers based on alkylthienyl BDT donor unit and difluorinatedquinoxaline ( Qx ) acceptor unit , and found that PBDT-DFQX-TT ( whose molecular structure is depicted in Scheme 1 ) demonstrated the best photovoltaic performance [28]. More interestingly , those Qx - based polymers all exhibited better performances for additive - and annealing - free devices than which treated by solvent additives and thermal annealing. On the basis of those previous findings , here , we propose that if the alkyl side chains on PBDT-DFQX-TT can be replaced by alkylthio side chains to further enhance the interchain interaction , the corresponding polymers might demonstrate improved performance for additive - and annealing - free devices. Therefore , with the intention to further improve the photovoltaic properties , as well as to investigate the effects of alkylthio side chains on the properties of the copolymers , we designed and synthesized two new polymers PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 ( shown in Scheme 1 , compared with the formerly reported PBDT-DFQX-TT in ref. 28 ) , by replacing alkyl side chains with branched or linear alkylthio side chains on the thienyl BDT units of the PBDT-DFQX-TT. The results showed that the two copolymers exhibit lower - lying HOMO energy level and closer interchains packing than PBDT-DFQX-TT attributed to the more polarizable S atom inducing stronger intermolecular interactions. The BHJ PSC based on PBDT-DFQx-TTSEH achieves high performance of 8.51% PCE without solvent additives or thermal annealing , whereas the highest PCE of PBDT-DFQx-TTSC8 device is 7.02% . As expected , both are higher than the devices treated by additive or annealing. These results demonstrate that introducing alkylthio substituents to enhance intermolecular interactions could be an effective strategy for developing new polymers with high - performance for additive - and annealing - free devices. (5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6,7difluoroquinoxaline ( M3 ) were synthesized according to previously reported procedures [16,22,28,29].",

The crude polymers were purified by continuous extractions with methanol , hexanes , chloroform and chlorobenzene. The polymers PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 were recovered from chlorobenzene fraction. The polymerization conditions , including type and dosages of the catalysts , reaction temperature and reaction times , etc , were controlled carefully to ensure acquired polymers with similar molecular weight. The molecular weights of the copolymers were measured by GPC in trichlorobenzene eluent at 150 °C using polystyrene standards. From the GPC results ( see Supporting Information , Figure S1 ) , one can see that the number - average molecular weights ( Mn ) of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 were 45.9 and 40.3 kDa , with polydispersity ( D ) of 3.69and 2.90 , respectively. Obviously , differences of the two polymers in M n and PDI are very small , which is beneficial for the comparative study on the effect of side chains. In addition , a high MW peak at relatively short retention time can be observed from the GPC plots of the two polymers , which has been proved to be the residues of previous sample because the GPC testing is continuous delivery of samples. Thermogravimetric Analysis ( TGA ) ( Figure S2 ) showed that PBDT-DFQx-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQx-TTSC8 were thermally stable with onset decomposition temperatures corresponding to 5% weight loss at 348 and 381 °C respectively. Obviously , both the polymers were stable enough for application in PSCs . Fig. 1 ( a ) and ( b ) show the absorption spectra of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 in chlorobenzene solution and as thin film coated on quartz glass , and the relative optical data are summarized in Table 1 , including the absorption peak wavelengths ( λ max ) , absorption edge wavelengths ( λonset ) , and the optical band gap ( E g opt ). For the convenience of comparison , the absorption spectra of PBDT-DFQX-TT in chlorobenzene solution and in thin film were also given in Fig. 1 ( a ) and ( b ). Itshould be note that all of the polymers have three characteristic absorption bands in the range of 300^-700 nm as solution or film. Amongst them , absorption in the wavelength range of 450^-550 nm arises from the π-π* localized transition , and absorption in 500^-700 nm is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the donor and acceptor units [30,31]. In comparison with PBDT-DFQX-TT , PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 showed slightly absorbance extension in both solution state and solid state as a result of p π (C)-d π ( S ) orbital overlap where divalent sulfur atom accepts π-electron from the aromatic group into its empty 3d-orbitals [15,16].

Well defined vibronic shoulder absorption peaks in the long wavelength range ( 600-700 nm ) of both polymers implied the existence of ordered aggregation and strong π-π stacking [16]. The peak at around 590 nm can be assigned as 0-1 vibronic transition and around 640 nm as 0-0. The dominant 0-0 vibronic peak is indicative of extended J-aggregate - like polymer chains that pack in ordered lamellae , whereas the 0-1 is of H-aggregatelike. H-aggregate - like polymer has a side - by - side arrangement of chains while the J-aggregate - like polymer is head - to - tail arrangement. PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TT have stronger 0-0 peaks indicated that the two polymers tend to form J-aggregate arrangement whereas PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 has a stronger 0-1 peak and tends to form H-aggregate arrangement. In generally , polymers tend to be an Haggregate - like arrangement are beneficial for intermolecular charge mobility. The polymer possesses H-aggregate - like interchain packing would perform better charge mobilities , J sc and PCEs for its devices [32][33][34]. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to measure the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the conjugated polymers. The measured cyclic voltammograms and energy level diagrams are illustrated in Figure S3 and Figure S4 , and the results are summarized in Table 1. The onset potentials for oxidation ( E ox ) of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 are 0.76 and 0.67 V vs. Ag / Ag+ , respectively. The onset potentials for reduction ( E red ) are -1.25 and -1.24 V vs. Ag / Ag + , respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the copolymers were calculated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential according to following eqn. ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : E HOMO = -e(E ox +4.71)(eV) ( 1 ) E LUMO = -e(E red +4.71)(eV) ( 2 ) The LUMO energy levels of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 are -3.46 and -3.47 eV , respectively. Compared to PBDT-DFQX-TT , the LUMO energy levels of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 are up - shifted a little. The HOMO energy levels of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 are -5.48 and -5.37eV , respectively. Compared to PBDT-DFQX-TT , the HOMO energy levels decrease by 0.28 and 0.17eV , respectively. Up - shifted LUMO and decreased HOMO of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 led to wider band - gaps than PBDT-DFQX-TT. These indicated that the alkylthio chains significantly influence the electronic properties of the 2Dconjugated polymers. And the down - shifted HOMO energy levels are in according with the literatures [16,22] and these would be favorable for acquiring PSCs with high V oc .",

The molecular main chain length was n = 1. The alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups to save computation time. The simplified molecules were referred as In addition , we noted that the HOMO energy level of PBDT-DFQX-TTS simulated by the DFT calculation seems significantly higher ( by ~ 0.5 eV ) than the experimental observation. The reason for such a deviation is that we adopted a monomer model ( the number of repeat units is one ) for simplifying DFT calculation. But for the CV measurements , the experimental observation represented the real results of the whole polymer . The device structure of PSCs for characterizing photovoltaic properties of polymers were ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : 2. Table S1 showed the devices performance data of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH under other building conditions did n't list in Table 2. Figure S5 shows the representative current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves of the best devices. In considering that there were some literatures reporting the commercially available zirconium acetylacetonate ( ZrAcac ) as a cathode interfacial layer ( CIL ) can efficiently enhance the PCEs of PSCs attributed to the well matching energy level of ZrAcac and Al electrode , and benefiting to efficient charge extraction [35,36] , here the ZrAcac was also used as a CIL to fabricate the device by spincoating its methanol solution on active layer at room temperature and without thermal annealing or any other posttreatment. As a result , PCEs of the devices for PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 were 7.02 and 8.51% , respectively. Especially , the J sc of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 device showed a more remarkable higher than PBDT-DFQX-TT and PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH , rendering the devices rather higher PCEs. Further treatment of adding 3% ( v / v ) 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) as additive into the solution for device fabrication caused J sc values of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 obviously increased but that of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH reduced. Especially , DIO treatment resulted in V oc s , FFs dramatic decrease of the two devices , therefore the PCEs was compromised by low V oc s , FFs. Relating to the AFM and GIXS results , the drop in the performance can be attributed to that the DIO further promoted the PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 and PC71BM self - aggregation , therefore forming larger impropre phased domain and unfavorable blend film morphology. In addition , thermal annealing ( TA ) treatment on the devices alsofailed to improve the performance. The PCEs of the two devices were slightly decreased after 140 °C 10 min thermal annealing ( TA ) treating.",

    "sentence": "The device of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH showed a great drop in FF but a slight increase in J sc , while that of the PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 demonstrated a little drop in both V oc and J sc , which resulted in declining the PCEs of the two devices , indicated that thermal annealingchanged the film mophologies to a undesirable status. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) curves of the devices fabricated under the optimal conditions for different posttreatment techniques are shown in Fig. 3. All the devices showed a broad EQE response range covering the visible region , which is attributed to the intrinsic absorption of both the polymers and PC71BM. All the devices exhibited a response range from 300 to 700 nm and rather high photon - conversion 3. The DIO treatment devices of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 showed an increase in hole mobilities and accorded with the J sc increase trend , while the PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH shown a drop in ߤ . However , the decreased V oc and FF , which were caused by the morphology change after treatment , suppressed the PCEs increase after treating with DIO. As the Table 3 showed , the hole mobilities of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 were decreased after thermal annealing and the reduced mobilities led to lowerJ sc and PCEs. In contrast , the hole mobilities of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH was increased after thermal annealing , in a line with the J sc increase. The hole mobilities of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH were in totally lower than of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 , which may be one of the reasons that the devices of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 get higher performance than that of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH fabricated at optimized conditions. However , the hole mobility of the PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 is nearly about one order of magnitude lower than the previously reported parent polymer PBDT-DFQX-TT [28] , our experiments in the later section showed that the photovoltaic performance of the former is better than the latter. These results indicated that when the hole mobility of the polymers has reached as high as 10^-4 to 10^-3 , the hole mobility will no longer be the main factor affecting their photovoltaic performance. Charge recombination is also an important factor in determining the J sc and FF of the PSCs. We used light - intensity dependent photocurrent measurements to study the charge recombination behaviour of polymers PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 in devices. In general , the relationship between J sc and illumination intensity ( P ) can be described as ‫ܬ‬ ௦ ∝ ܲ ఈ , where power - law exponent ( α ) should be approximated to 1 when charge recombination can be neglected [37,38] .The measuring devices were fabricated with the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / ZrAcac / Al and without other treatment. As we can see in the Fig. 4 , the α values for the PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 were 0.958 and 1.000 , respectively. High values of α suggested that bimolecular recombination was significantly suppressed. PC Higher α value of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 can be one of the reasons that PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 performed higherJ sc and FF than PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH.",

The PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH under optical condition got an E loss = 0.88 eV while the E loss of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 was 0.87eV. The devices of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 possess lower E loss , higher EQE and lower charge recombination than PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH should be prior factors to PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 devices getting higher photovoltaic performance . To gain deep insight into effect of morphologies of the polymer / PC71BM blend films on the device performance , atomic force microscope ( AFM ) and grazing incidence X-ray scattering ( GIXS ) were used to investigate the microstructures of the polymer / PC71BM blend films. root-mean-square ( Rms ) values of the PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and the PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8. The Rms values of two polymers were enhanced by treating with DIO which is attributed to that DIO treatment can promote the phase separation and self - aggregation , making the polymers to form bigger domain size [41]. Generally , smaller domain size can provide larger area of D / A interface and get more efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation. Owning to the strong inter-molecular chain attraction which can hinder the molecules move , the Rms of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH blend film ( c ) and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 blend film ( f ) did n't show a lot of change. The topography of film ( f ) compared with film ( d ) did n't change a lot so that the PCEs of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 additive - free devices after thermal annealing were slightly decreased correlatively. And as the Fig. S7 show , there were many terrible particles appeared on the AFM topography of the films both treated with DIO and thermal annealing. The terrible morphology caused the performance of devices seriously decrease after thermal annealing. Fig. 6 shows the GIXS profiles of the polymer films. All these polymer films were spin - cast from DCB ( 10 mg°ml -1 ) to simulate the active layer in device. Fig. 6 ( a ) and ( b ) are the films scattering pattern belong to in-plane ( IP ) direction and out - of - plane ( OOP ) direction respectively. The black lines belong to the neat polymer films , the red lines are obtained from blend films without treatment , and blue lines are of blend films treated with 3% DIO. Both two polymers show ( 100 ) reflection at around 0.25Å -1 in IP and OOP directions , which belong to lamellar stacking. ( 100 ) reflection showed sharpen peak after treat with DIO and thermal annealing , indicated that there was more order lamellar stacking formed [42].

    "sentence": "Both two neat polymers film show a strong π-π stacking peaks around 1.75Å -1 only in OOP direction , which indicate that both two polymers prefer to show face-on orientation molecule stacking [43]. The π-π stacking peaks of PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 were at 1.73Å -1 and 1.84Å -1 , respectively. Correlatively , the π-π stacking distance were 3.63 and 3.41Å respectively , which were both closer than 3.79Å of PBDT-DFQX-TT ( Ref. 28 ). Closer π-π stacking distances are attributed to the higher interchain interaction , which can improve the inter-molecular exciton transfer and it should be a reason to get higher photovoltaic performance. Theπ-π stacking peaks were dimmed by blending with the PC71BM , which indicates that polymers well intermixed with PC71BM and partly decomposed the intermolecular ordered packing. While after treating with DIO theπ-π stacking peaks become more identifiable , which indicates that DIO treatment precipitates the polymers and PC71BM selfaggregation [16]. And relate to AFM results , we consider that the polymers and PC71BM formed undesired large domain sizes respectively , aftertreatingwithDIOorthermalannealing , therefore leading to decrease of the device performance . In this work , two new copolymers PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 with branched or linear akylthio side chains , respectively , were designed and synthesized. Replacing alkyl with alkylthio side chains is shown to down - shift HOMO energy levels of the polymers and slightly red - shift the absorption peaks , and enhance the interchain interaction , therefore affect the BHJ morphology with PC71BM greatly. The polymer PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH with branched alkylthio side chains possesses lower HOMO energy level while PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 with linear alkylthio side chains exhibites higher hole mobilities. Optimization of PSC fabrication conditions provided a maximal PCE of 7.02% for PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and 8.51% for PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 through a simplified processing procedure without any additives and thermal annealing.Thehigh cell performance of as-casting devices originates mainly from that an appropriate bulk BHJ morphology has been formed during margins the spin - casting due to a strong interchain interaction. This is the first report on Qx - based polymers for additive - and annealing - free high - performance polymer solar cells. For GIXS , the spin - cast neat polymer films and blend films were illuminated at a constant incidence angle of 0.2 ° . Scattering intensities are expressed as a function of the scattering vector q = 4π / λ°sinθ , where θ is the half scattering angle and λ = 1.57Å is the wavelength of the incident radiation. The d-spacing of a peak is expressed by d = 2π / q .",

The selenophene π bridges in J76 can narrow optical band gap and red - shift absorption of the polymer film by ca. 25 nm , but the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level ( E HOMO ) of J76 is up - shifted slightly by 0.04 eV. Two typical electron acceptors of fullerene derivative PC71BM and the nonfullerene acceptor m-ITIC were used to investigate photovoltaic performance of the polymer donors. For the PC71BM - based polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , J76 with selenophene π bridges shows the best power - conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 8.40% in comparison with the J71 - based device ( PCE = 6.79% ) , benefitted from the red - shifted absorption , larger coherence length , purer average domains , and proper domain size of J76 donor in the blend film with PC71BM. For the nonfullerene PSCs with m-ITIC as acceptor , the J76 - based PSCs showed a slightly lower PCE of 11.04% in comparison with the J71 - based device ( PCE = 11.73% ) , which could be due to the up - shifted HOMO level and slightly larger domain size of J76 in the blend film with m-ITIC. The results indicate that the selenophene π bridges of the polymers red - shifted absorption and increased PCE of the fullerene - based PSCs ; nevertheless , it has weak influence on the photovoltaic performance of the nonfullerene PSCs . Bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs with p - type conjugated polymer as donor and n - type organic semiconductor ( n-OS ) as acceptor have drawn extensive attention due to their great potential for application with the advantages of lightweight , flexibility , and capability to be fabricated into flexible and semitransparent devices. 1-9 Recently , nonfullerene n-OS acceptors have achieved significant development , which leads to rapid increase of PCE of the PSCs to over 13% . 10-22 At the same time , a series of high performance medium or wide bandgap conjugated polymer donors were also developed , 7,23-25 including the J-series polymers reported by our group , in considering lower - lying HOMO energy level and complementary absorption with the narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors. 26-28 Among the J-series polymer donors , J71 with alkylsilyl side chain , demonstrated good photovoltaic performance. The PCE of the J71 - based PSCs with the n-OS ITIC or m-ITIC as acceptor reached 11.41% and 12.05% , respectively. 28,29 However , the device based on J71 with the fullerene derivative PC71BM as acceptor demonstrated a lower PCE of 6.79% ( see Table 2 ) , which is much lower than its PSCs with nonfullerene acceptor.",

By developing its analogue polymers with lower bandgap and red - shift absorption to harvest more solar photons could improve photovoltaic performance of the polymers with PC71BM as acceptor. 30,31 Recent studies on the conjugated polymers showed that substitution of thiophene by selenophene in the molecular structure of the polymers commonly lead to red - shifted absorption band and lower bandgap due to the enhanced ground - state quinoid resonance character of selenophene. 32-39 In this work , we synthesized two new polymer donors J75 and J76 ( see Scheme 2 ) based on J71 with substitution of thiophene by selenophene on the conjugated side chains of BDT unit ( J75 ) or π bridges ( J76 ) and studied the effect of the selenophene substitution on the photovoltaic performance of the polymer donor J71. And the photovoltaic performance of the polymer donors in comparison with their corresponding polymer donor J71 was studied by using fullerene derivative PC71BM 40 The detailed synthetic procedures are described in the Experimental Section in the Supporting Information. We introduced two selenophenes conjugated side chains on BDT unit in monomer M2 , and two selenophenes π bridges in M4. The polymers were synthesized by the palladium - catalyzed Stille coupling polymerization with high yield. The polymers exhibit good solubility in organic solvents ( chloroform , chlorobenzene , and 1,2-dichlorobenzene ). Molecular weights of the two polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , and the numberaverage molecular weights ( M n ) are 22.6 and 16.2 kDa with corresponding polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 1.86 and 1.67 for J75 and J76 respectively ( see Table 1 ). Thermal stability of the two polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The decomposition temperature ( T d ) of J75 and J76 at 5% weight loss is 448 and 452 °C , respectively , which indicates that the thermal stability of the two polymers is good enough for their application in PSCs. Absorption Spectra and Electronic Energy Levels. The ultraviolet - visible ( UV - vis ) absorption spectra of J75 , J76 , J71 and m-ITIC films are shown in Figure 1a. The absorption spectrum of J75 film shows an absorption band in the wavelength range of 400-700 nm with two peaks at 539 and 580 nm respectively , which is similar with its corresponding polymer J71. 28 The absorption edge of J75 film is at 641 nm , corresponding to an energy bandgap ( E g ) of 1.93 eV. While J76 film shows red - shifted absorption with absorption peaks at 563 and 611 nm respectively and absorption edge at 667 ( E g = 1.86 eV ).",

    "sentence": "The red - shifted absorption of J76 ( by ca. 25 nm ) in comparison to that of J71 , should result from the selenophene substitution on π bridges of the polymer. The film maximum absorption coefficients for J75 and J76 are 0.80 × 10^5 and 0.83 × 10^5 cm^-1 , respectively ( see Figure S2a , Supporting Information ) , which are slightly weaker than that ( 0.96 × 10^5 cm^-1 ) 28 of J71 film. To understand the effect of the selenophene substitution on the electronic energy levels of the polymers , we employed cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) to evaluate E HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level ( E LUMO ) of the polymers with Ag / AgCl as the reference electrode. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated from the onsets of oxidation and reduction potentials ( E ox / red ) , respectively , according to the equation E HOMO / LUMO = -e(E ox / red + 4.36 ) ( eV ). The E HOMO and E LUMO values of J75 and J76 were calculated to be -5.49 and -3.66 eV and -5.41 and -3.66 eV , respectively. In comparison with the E HOMO of -5.45 eV and the E LUMO of -3.67 eV for J71 ( see Figure S2b , Supporting Information ) , the E HOMO value of J75 with the selenophene substitution on BDT unit is downshifted a little ( by 0.04 eV ) , while the E HOMO of J76 with the selenophene π bridges is up shifted slightly by 0.04 eV. The electronic energy levels diagram of J75 and J76 is displayed in Figure 2b. McCulloch et al. reported that selenophenesubstitution on π bridges of the copolymers causes a slight raise in E HOMO values and E LUMO stabilization and narrowing of optical band gaps with red - shifting of UV - vis absorption. 36 Our results confirm the effect of selenophene π bridges on reducing E g , red - shifting absorption and up - shifting HOMO energy level of the copolymers. Photovoltaic Performance. To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the polymers , we fabricated the PSCs with a conventional device structure : ITO ( indium tin oxide ) / PEDOT : PSS ( poly ( 3,4- S1 in the Supporting Information. We also used PC61BM as acceptor to fabricate PSCs based on the polymer donors with the same device fabrication conditions as those with PC71BM as acceptor , to investigate if the similar effects when blended with all types of fullerene acceptors. We found that the tendency of photovoltaic performance parameters for polymer donors : PC61BM is the same as polymer donors : PC71BM ( see Table S2 and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information ). We think its similar effects could occur when blended with all types of fullerene acceptors.",

    "sentence": "For the PSCs without CN solvent additive treatment , the device based on J71 : PC71BM showed a PCE of 3.30% with an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.92 V , a short - circuit current density ( J sc ) of 8.17 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 43.82% . And the device based on J75 : PC71BM showed a PCE of 3.88% with a higher V oc of 0.95 V due to downshifted HOMO of J75 , a J sc of 9.83 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 41.83% . However , the device based on J76 : PC71BM demonstrated a higher PCE of 4.33% with a J sc of 9.73 mA cm^-2 , a FF of 49.33% , and a slightly lower V oc of 0.90 V due to the up - shifted HOMO level of J76. After using 0.5% CN solvent additive , the PCEs of the three PC71BM - based devices are dramatically increased to 6.79% , 7.71% and 8.37% for the PSCs with J71 , J75 and J76 as donor , respectively. We can clearly see from Table 2 and Table S1 that the increased PCEs of the three devices after using solvent additive come from the increase of J sc and FF. The higher J sc values of the devices with 0.5% CN solvent additive treatment can be confirmed from their IPCE spectra ( see Figure 2b ) , and the IPCE spectra agree well with the change in absorption of the donors. Selenophene substitution on π bridges of J76 caused absorption band red - shifted by ca. 25 nm , leading to the higher J sc value of the J76 - based PSCs than the J71 and J75 - based PSCs. The maximum IPCE values reached 75% , 80% , and 79% for the PSCs based on J71 , J75 , and J76 , respectively , which together with the enhanced FF Article indicate efficient charge dissociation and transportation in the active layers after using 0.5% CN solvent additive. The integrated J sc values of the PSCs from the IPCE spectra agree well with the J sc values measured from J-V curves within a 5% mismatch. The new polymer of J76 with red - shifted absorption increased the efficiency in blend with PC71BM. Nevertheless , the efficiencies of fullerene - based PSCs were limited mainly by the relatively narrow absorption of the fullerene acceptor. We further fabricated the nonfullerene PSCs with n-OS m-ITIC as acceptor , for further investigating photovoltaic performance of the polymer donors. Figure 2c shows the J-V curves of the PSCs and Table 2 listed the photovoltaic performance data of the devices with m-ITIC as acceptor. Obviously , the nonfullerene PSCs with m-ITIC as acceptor demonstrated significantly improved photovoltaic performance. The PCEs reached 11.73% , 11.41% , and 11.04% for the PSCs based on J71 , J75 , and J76 respectively.",

The results indicate that the selenophene substitution on the π bridges of the polymers redshifted their absorption and increased PCE of the fullerenebased PSCs , nevertheless , it has weak influence on the photovoltaic performance of the nonfullerene PSCs. In addition , we also synthesized the copolymer J77 by copolymerization of M2 and M4 ( both the selenophene substitution on side chain and π-bridge ). The J77 : PC71BMbased devices show the PCE of 4.34% and 7.97 with or without 0.5% CN additive , and the PSCs based on J77 : m-ITIC demonstrated the PCE of 10.54% , see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. The photovoltaic performance of the polymer donor J77 is similar to that of J75 and J76. So , we mainly discussed the photovoltaic performance of polymer J75 and J76. We used the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method to study the charge mobilities ( see Figure S7a,b ). We can clearly see that electron mobilities with using 0.5% CN are higher than that without using solvent additive ( see Table S3 and Table S4 in the Supporting Information ) , while the hole mobilities were similar and without evident changes. The hole ( μ h ) / electron ( μ e ) mobility ratio of the three devices with using 0.5% CN additive treatment are 2.1 , 1.9 , and 1.2 for the PSCs based on J71 , J75 , and J76 blended with PC71BM , respectively. The more - balanced mobility for the devices with CN additive treatment are beneficial for electron / hole transportation , which should be one of the reasons for their higher J sc and FF than that of the devices without using solvent additive treatment. We also measured the charge carrier mobilities of the m-ITIC based PSCs by SCLC method ( see Figure S7c ). Both electron and hole mobility of J71 - based PSCs is higher than that of the PSCs based on J75 and J76 ( see Table S5 in the Supporting Information ). The hole ( μ e ) / electron ( μ h ) mobility ratio of the three devices are 1.92 , 2.24 , and 3.00 for the J71 , J75 , and J76 - based PSCs ( see Table S5 in the Supporting Information ) , respectively. The higher electron and hole mobility and more - balanced mobility of the J71 - based PSCs could be one reason for its higher J sc , thus better photovoltaic performance. Morphology Analysis. Photovoltaic performance of the conjugated polymer donor materials is tightly related to their morphology in the active layer blended with the acceptors.",

The GIWAXS patterns of neat acceptor films and blend films of the polymers with PC71BM without CN are also shown in Figure S8 for a clear comparison. The π-π stacking distance and coherence length data are listed in Table S6 in the Supporting Information. The donors and m-ITIC show preferred face-on molecular packing orientation relative to the substrate. The π-π stacking distance of J71 , J75 and J76 is 3.83 , 3.85 , and 3.83 Å , respectively , indicating that replacing thiophene by selenophene on the conjugated side chain of BDT unit or π bridges has little influence on the π-π stacking distance. The corresponding coherence length of neat films is calculated ( via the Scherrer equation ) to be 2.5 , 2.5 , and 2.7 nm , respectively. Coherence length of J76 is slightly higher compared to other two polymers. It can be seen from Table S6 that J76 in its blend film with PC71BM with and without CN additive has slightly larger coherence length than that of J71 , which are beneficial for the charge transport thus achieve higher FF and J sc ; nevertheless , the π-π stacking distances are around the similar values for all the blend films. The improved Article molecular packing of the selenophene - substituted polymers J75 and J76 also can be seen from Table S6 , which indicate that their fullerene devices with CN additive treatment are favorable for charge transport , so that could achieve higher FF and J sc and thus higher PCE. In the polymer donors : m-ITIC system , the π-π stacking distance and coherence length of the three polymers blended with m-ITIC were similar and without evident changes in comparison to the PC71BM system. We further probed the phase separation behavior in the blend films of the polymers with PC71BM or m-ITIC with resonant soft X-ray scattering ( RSoXs ) , 45 as shown in Figure S9 , and the domain size values of the blend films are displayed in Table S6 in the Supporting Information. The Lorentzcorrected RSoXS assumes 3D domain isotropy 46 and exhibits a bimodal correlation distribution with two well - defined peaks in the PC71BM system without additives ( corresponding to a small and large domains size ). The RSoXs data exhibits only one correlation distribution ( only smaller size domains ) after processing with CN additive.

    "sentence": "Due to the asymmetric nature of the phase diagram in polymer : small molecule blends , the small moleculerich phase is likely very pure and the scattering intensity tracks in a monotonic way the concentration of the small molecule in the polymer - rich phase. From the scattering intensity , we infer that the CN additive treatment leads to relatively higher domain purity ( see Figure S9a,b,c ) and that J76 : PC71BM blend with CN additive treatment gives higher relative domain purity than in the J71 : PC71BM and J75 : PC71BM blend films. Compared with the blend films without CN treatment , the small phase separation and higher relative domain purity observed in the blend films with CN treatment are beneficial for charge separation and transport , leading to higher J sc and FF. It is necessary to note that the absorption of J76 is redshifted by ca. 25 nm in comparison to that of J71 and J75 , which also leads to higher J sc values of the PSCs based on J76 : PC71BM. Combining RSoXs with GIWAXS data , J76 blended with PC71BM has larger coherence length , proper phase separation , and higher relative domain purity , thus achieving the higher FF and PCE. In the m-ITIC system , the approximate average domain size of J71 , J75 , and J76 in the blend films with m-ITIC is 30 , 33 , and 46 nm , respectively ( see Figure S9d and Table S6 in the Supporting Information ). It is accepted that the optimal domain size for PSCs is about 20- 30 nm ; 49 the slightly large domain size of J76 : m-ITIC blend film diminishes the excitons effective separation , which reduces the J sc and PCE of the PSCs. The morphology of the blend films was further studied using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) measurements. In the PC71BM system , the blend films based on J71 , J75 , and J76 without CN additive show the surface morphology with a root-mean-square ( RMS ) roughness of 1.40 , 1.32 , and 1.43 nm , respectively ( see Figure S10a-c ). The TEM images of these blend films show obviously large phase - separation in bulk , which results in lower J sc ( see Figure S10d-f ). After using 0.5% CN solvent additive , the blend films show a much smoother surface with RMS roughness of 0.58 , 0.55 , and 0.86 nm , respectively ( see Figure 4a We synthesized two new copolymers J75 and J76 by selenophene substitution of thiophene on the conjugated side chains of BDT or π bridges of the D-A copolymer J71 based on alkylsilyl-BDT donor unit and bifluorobenzotriazole acceptor unit with thiophene π bridges.

Compared with the counterpart , P(BT-DPP) , which contains no end - caps , P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn showed remarkably enhancement of light absorption in the range of ca. 400-550 nm resulted from the end - capping effect of porphyrins. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on these polymers were fabricated and the results showed significant improvement of power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of the endcapped polymers. Especially , ligand addivie , 4,4′-bipyridine ( Bipy ) , was applied to the PSCs based on polymers end - capped by porphyrins and the PCE of the photovoltaic device based on P(BT-DPP)-QPZn significantly improved from 2.92% to 4.45% with the comprehensive benefits of optimization strategies such as using additives and thermal annealing. Furthermore , thermal aging experiments showed increased stability of the optimal morphology of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM blend film after the use of Bipy. This study provides a promising strategy to design donor - acceptor copolymers with multifunctional end - caps and to use ligand additives for achieving PSCs with both high - efficiency and long - term stability , which are critical for the devices to be commercially useful . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have emerged as promising alternatives to inorganic photovoltaic devices due to their potential advantages of low cost , lightweight , and capability to be fabricated into flexible devices. 1 Although the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs has been rapidly improved from below 1% to over 10% in the past decades , 2 there are still many improvements that need to make before wide scale manufacture of PSCs. One of the most effective strategies to improve PCEs is molecular structure engineering of conjugated polymers , for example , rational design of conjugated polymers backbones , side chain engineering , and substituents. 3 The design rules for high efficiency photovoltaic polymers are much complicated because many factors that influence the photovoltaic performance should be simultaneously considered to meet with all the requirements , such as light absorption , energy levels , charge mobility , solubility , morphology , and phase separation. 4 On one hand , the conjugated polymers for photovoltaic materials are generally strong rigid , which implies limited solubility in organic solvent. The widely used strategy to solve this problem for the sake of solution - processing is to introduce flexible side chains to the polymers. With the increase of the bulk of flexible side chains , polymers tend to be easily soluble. But this strategy brings another problem , that is , bulky side chains would inevitably decrease the concentration of polymer chromophores , which would further decrease the light absorption of polymers. Therefore , when introducing side chains to polymers , one should consider the balance between sufficient solubility and strong light absorption ability.",

    "sentence": "On the other hand , polymers with higher molecular weights were reported to be more likely to gain better device performance. 5 However , solubility is a major limit when attempting to synthesize polymers with high molecular weights. Thus , the resulted polymers often show limited molecular weights. Under this circumstance , the end - group effect of polymers would be very prominent. Therefore , it is of significance to put emphasis on the end - capping process of polymers. Traditionally , donor - acceptor polymers synthesized by Stille - coupling polymerization without subsequent end - capping process would contain residual unreacted stannyl and bromide functionalities at the end groups. These residual unreacted functionalities are considered as structural defects that deteriorate the overall device performance by charge trapping , photogenerated excitons quenching , chain packing , or film morphology. 6 Up to now , some studies reported the endcapping effect of polymers on photovoltaic performance of PSCs , but the common end groups were restricted to some simple groups , such as phenyl and thienyl , in most cases. 7 Apart from the end - group effect , the insufficient light absorption in short wavelength region of donor - acceptor polymers is also a problem that restricts the improvement of photovoltaic performance. Therefore , it is of great importance to solve both the end - group problem and the light absorption problem by means of end - capping process for donor - acceptor polymers. Porphyrins with high absorption in short wavelength region 8 are excellent candidates to solve both these problems. In particular , quinoxalino [2,3-b′]porphyrin ( QP ) , 9 in which the porphyrin is edge - fused with a pyrazine ring , would be parallel instead of vertical to the polymer molecular plane like the original porphyrin does when being used as end - cap. The advantage of parallel arrangement of QP lies in that it would not hamper the assembly of donor - acceptor polymers. In addition , the advantage of using QP as end - cap for donor- acceptor polymers lies in that a promising strategy using ligand additive is expected to be applied to improve the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs reported in our recent study. 10 More importantly , although the PCEs of 10% were achieved for PSCs , sufficient long - term stability of the devices is still a challenge for the organic photovoltaic to become commercially viable. 11 The stability of the performance of PSCs largely depends on the stability of the photoactive layer , in which the two bicontinuous phases of the elcetron donor and acceptor materials change in dimensions over time. Therefore , the key point to improve the stability of PSCs is to stabilize the photoactive layer. Up to now , some studies reported the crosslinkable π-conjugated semiconducting donor polymers 12 or cross-linkable small molecule additives 13 containing functionalities such as oxetane , 14 bromo , 15 vinyl , 16 and azide 17 functional groups.",

Gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) was used to determine the molecular weights of the polymers. In order to reduce the deviation from the actual status of the polymers caused by the tendency of rigid - rod conformation , here , we applied the GPC measurements in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene which dissolves the polymers better and at a high temperature of 150 °C instead of in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. Table 1 shows the number - average molecular weight ( M n ) , weight - average molecular weight ( M w ) , and polydispersity index ( PDI ) of the polymers. The ratios of QP and QPZn versus the repeating units of the polymers were estimated to be about 15.4% for P(BT-DPP)-QP and 16.7% for P(BT-DPP)-QPZn , according to the results of GPC combined with elemental analyses of the polymers. Figure 2 shows the thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) plots of the polymers with a heating rate of 10 °C / min in nitrogen.

    "sentence": "As shown in Figure S16 , in chloroform solution , QP showed a strong absorption peak wavelength at 421 nm and two weak peaks at 535 and 602 nm , while QPZn showed a strong absorption peak wavelength at 413 nm and two weak peaks at 574 and 635 nm. The absorption features of P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn indicated that the end - caps of QP and QPZn units enhanced the absorption of relevant polymers in the short wavelength region. Hence , the increased usage of photons may be anticipated to increase the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) of the photovoltaic devices. Furthermore , all the absorption peaks of the polymers in films showed red - shifts compared with those in solution because of the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. Also , the obvious broadened and enhanced absorption in films indicated the formation of efficient intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) effect in the polymer chains. Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was used to study the electrochemical properties of the polymers. Figure 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films. The onset oxidation potential ( E ox ) of P(BT-DPP) , P(BT-DPP)-T , P(BT-DPP)-QP , and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn are -1.16 , -1.19 , -1.21 , and -1.21 V vs Ag / Ag + , respectively , while the onset reduction potential ( E red ) of the polymers are 0.46 , 0.51 , 0.47 , and 0.47 V vs Ag / Ag + , as shown in Figure 5 and Table 2. The highest occupied molecular orbital ( 3 ) The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers are -5.17 and -3.55 eV for P(BT-DPP) , -5.22 and -3.52 eV for P(BT-DPP)-T,and -5.18 and -3.50 eV for both P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn. Here , the HOMO energy levels of the polymers are primarily dominated by BT units , and the LUMO energy levels of the polymers are primarily dominated by DPP units. The very slight difference ( within ± 0.05 eV ) in the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these polymers indicates that the end - caps do not significantly influence the overall energy levels of the polymers. Similar results were found in other polymers end - capped by various end - caps. 6b The speculated reason for the slight effect of endcaps on the electrochemical properties of the polymers is that the end - caps only appear in two terminals of polymer chains which occupy too little portions to determine the overall energy levels of the polymers. The proper location of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers would provide both sufficient open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the PSCs and driving force for charge separation and transfer between polymer and PC71BM.",

    "sentence": "22 In addition , because the V oc is determined by the difference between the HOMO energy level of polymer donor and the LUMO energy level of PC71BM acceptor , the similarity of the HOMO energy levels of the polymers suggests no obvious difference in the subsequent V oc of the PSCs fabricated from the polymers with or without end - caps. Photovoltaic Properties. Photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated by fabricating a series of BHJ solar cells with configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / photoactive layer / Ca / Al. Photoactive layers were prepared by spin - coating the mixtures of polymers and PC71BM from chloroform solutions. In order to optimize the device performances , the weight ratio of polymers to PC71BM was carefully tuned. Figure 6a shows the current density - voltage characteristics of the PSCs based on polymer : PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2 and representative data are summarized in Table 3. P(BT-DPP) without end - caps showed a low PCE of 1.48% with a low J sc of 3.65 mA / cm^2 , while polymers with endcaps showed different photovoltaic properties according to different end - capping units. P(BT-DPP)-T with end - capping unit of T showed a slight higher PCE than P(BT-DPP) , mainly because of the decreased structural defects resulted from the end - capping unit , which would hamper undesired degradation of device performance. 7 P(BT-DPP)-QP with end - capping unit of QP showed the highest PCE of 3.33% with the highest J sc of 8.25 mA / cm^2 among these four polymers , which was ascribed to the enhancement of absorption of P(BT-DPP)-QP in the wavelength range of 400-550 nm caused by the end - capping unit of QP. However , P(BT-DPP)-QPZn with end - capping unit of QPZn showed a slightly lower PCE than P(BT-DPP)-QP , which may be due to the limited enhancement of absorption of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn. For further optimizing the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn , additives and thermal annealing were applied to the fabrication of photovoltaic devices. Figure 6b shows the current density- voltage characteristics of the PSCs based on P(BT-DPP)-QP:PC71BM and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM under different optimized conditions. 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) was reported to be an efficient solvent additive to improve the performance of PSCs based on DPP - containing polymers. 23 Here , we also added DIO as an additive into the blend solution of polymer and PC71BM to optimize the performance of photovoltaic devices. It can be noted that the use of DIO did improve the performance of devices based on both P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn , which was quite consistent with the influence of solvent additives on photovoltaic performance based on the principle of different solubility toward donor and acceptor materials. In our previous study , we reported that the coordination effect between ligand additive , 4,4′-bipyridine ( Bipy ) , and polymers containing metalloporphyrin facilitates the optimization of film morphology and device performance.",

    "sentence": "10 Here , on the basis of using DIO solvent additive , we also added Bipy ligand additive into the blend solution of photoactive materials. The effect of additives combined with thermal annealing on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn was investigated. The results showed that the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on P(BT-DPP)-QP slightly decreased after adding Bipy. No obvious difference in photovoltaic performance was observed after further thermal annealing. The slightly decreased PCE may be explained by disturbed packing of polymer chains caused by extra Bipy , resulting in a slight decrease of J sc . In contrast , after adding Bipy into the PSC based on P(BT-DPP)-QPZn , the device showed a remarkably improved PCE from 3.48% to 4.16% with a largely enhancement of J sc to 10.38 mA / cm^2. After thermal annealing , the PCE of photovoltaic device based on P(BT-DPP)-QPZn further improved to 4.45% with a high J sc of 11.99 mA / cm^2. The largely enhancement of J sc may be ascribed to the optimized morphology of the photoactive layer resulted from the coordination effect between Bipy and the end - capping unit of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn. Intriguingly , it should be noted that V oc was also largely enhanced after adding Bipy into P(BT-DPP)-QPZn - based PSCs. Actually , this is not the first example of enhancing V oc by using Bipy additive. In our previous study on effect of Bipy additive on PSCs fabricated from quinoxalinoporphyrinatozinc - based polymer , the enhancement of V oc was also apparent. 10 Since the exact mechanism is not very clear , here , we can only speculate that Zn-N interactions between the end - caps of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn and Bipy additive played a great role in the enhancement probably by causing the recovery of V oc loss , which was similar to the effect of N-N interactions observed between N - containing polymer and N - containing interlayer on the performance of PSCs. 4c , 24 To further investigate the effect of ligand additive Bipy on the photovoltaic devices , some simple thermal aging experiments were employed to devices based on P(BT-DPP)-QPZn. After thermal aging at 110 °C for 1 h , the PSC processed with only DIO showed a PCE of 2.12% , which retained only 61% of its initial PCE. However , the PSC processed with both DIO and Bipy showed a PCE of 3.36% , which retained 76% of PCE. We suppose that the use of Bipy would stabilize the photoactive layer , leading to the decreased degradation in the condition of device aging. The results showed much similarity to the increased stability of optimal morphology caused by crosslinkable additives. 25 Figure 7 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) characteristics of the devices fabricated under optimized conditions. Broad EQE responses ranging from 300 to 900 nm were observed in all the devices.",

    "sentence": "P(BT-DPP) without endcaps showed highest EQE value of 19% at 351 nm , while endcapped polymers , P(BT-DPP)-T , P(BT-DPP)-QP , and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn , showed EQE values of 34% at 361 nm , 51% at 489 nm , and 60% at 480 nm , respectively. Especially , P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn showed obviously enhanced EQE responses in the short wavelength range of ca. 400-600 nm for one reason that these two polymers showed enhanced absorption in this region and for another reason that the optimization approaches of using DIO and Bipy as additives combined with thermal annealing facilitate the generation of photocurrent , which corresponded well with the remarkable increase of J sc values. However , one can notice that the EQE responses in the wavelength region over 600 nm where the absorption of polymers dominates were lower than those in the 400-600 nm range where PC71BM seemed to contribute this region. The relatively small contribution from the polymer main absorption may be a common problem for many PSCs fabricated from DPP - based polymers. A study revealed the correlation between quantum efficiency and fibril width in PSCs fabricated from DPP - based polymers , and EQE responses for blends with fibrils wider than 12 nm were low because of the limitation of charge generation and exciton diffusion length ascribed to the short singlet excited state lifetime ( < 100 ps ) of DPP - based polymers. 23 Here , as discussed in the following morphology section , although distinct fibrous interpenetrating networks were observed in the blend film of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM after using Bipy , the fibril width was still wider than the ideal width , which may lead to relatively low EQE responses in the wavelength region over 600 nm. Film Morphology. Two - dimensional grazing incidence Xray diffraction ( 2D-GIXRD ) measurement was performed to study the crystallinity of the polymer films based on different end - caps. As shown in Figure 8 , the film of P(BT-DPP) without end - caps showed a strong ( 100 ) diffraction peak and a weak ( 200 ) diffraction peak , indicating strong crystallinity of P(BT - DPP ). The film of P(BT-DPP)-T , P(BT-DPP)-QP , and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn with end - caps of T , QP , and QPZn , respectively , also showed ( 100 ) and ( 200 ) diffraction peaks , but with relatively large arcing of diffractions , indicating that the endcaps reduced the crystallinity of polymers. However , compared with other donor - acceptor conjugated polymers , the crystallinity of these polymers with end - caps was still considered to be strong. In order to reveal the effect of end - caps and the optimized conditions on the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs , tapping mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was performed on polymer : PC71BM blend films. The height images of photoactive layers of P(BT-DPP) , P(BT-DPP)-T , P(BT-DPP)-QP , and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn blended with PC71BM are shown in Figure S17.",

    "sentence": "No obvious differences in morphology were observed among these films , indicating that the end - caps do not significantly alter the morphology of the photoactive layers. Besides , relatively large donor / acceptor domain sizes were observed in all the AFM images , which are unfavorable to charge separation and transport. Therefore , relatively low J sc s of the corresponding photovoltaic devices were observed Figure 9 shows the height images of P(BT-DPP)-QP:PC71BM and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM blend films processed under different optimized conditions. The morphology of P(BT-DPP)-QP:PC71BM and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM blend films after adding DIO were very alike , both showing fine donor / acceptor domain sizes and ordered packing of polymers , which can be ascribed to the intrinsic property of DIO as a solvent additive that selectively dissolves donor and acceptor materials. Specifically , DIO is a poor solvent for most polymers but an excellent solvent for PC71BM , so it provides sufficient time for the polymer to crystallize into ordered structures. Therefore , the J sc s of the corresponding photovoltaic devices slightly increased. However , it was reported that nucleation that promotes aggregation of polymer chains was observed in blend films when using DIO as additive. 26 The presence of nucleation would cause small isolated acceptor domains in donor , or in reverse , isolated donor domains in acceptor. These isolated domains could act as charge traps that deteriorate the overall device performance. Therefore , the J sc s of the photovoltaic devices of P(BT-DPP)-QP:PC71BM and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM were still not high enough after being processed with DIO. Interestingly , distinct difference was observed in the morphology of P(BT-DPP)-QP:PC71BM and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM blend films after adding Bipy. For P(BT-DPP)-QP:PC71BM blend film , the average surface roughness ( R a ) decreased from 2.97 to 2.56 nm with less ordered packing of polymer chains , which may be ascribed to the disturbance of polymer chains caused by additional Bipy. Because the blend film failed to form obvious interpenetrating networks , the fabricated photovoltaic device showed decreased J sc . After thermal annealing was applied to the blend film , the R a increased to 2.84 nm with excessively large domain sizes of polymer in blend film , which was unfavorable to charge separation and transport. Therefore , the J sc of the corresponding photovoltaic device was still relatively low. However , for P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM blend film , the morphologies showed much difference from those of P(BT-DPP)-QP:PC71BM blend film after Bipy was added as additive. The blend film showed slightly reduced R a from 3.09 to 2.92 nm with disappearance of nucleation. Interestingly , entangled interpenetrating networks were observed in the blend film of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM after using Bipy. The entangled interpenetrating networks were reported to facilitate charge separation and transport , which caused a remarkable increase of J sc and PCE of the corresponding photovoltaic device.",

Herein , we measured the UV - vis absorption spectra of the P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM blend film before and after using Bipy. As shown in Figure S18 , although no obvious red shifts were observed in the Soret band , an absorption shoulder of 720 nm of the absorption spectra was observed instead , which could be used as an indicator of the H-aggregation of DPP - based polymers. 29 After using Bipy , the absorption shoulder of 720 nm showed a slight enhancement , indicating the increase of side - by - side arrangement of chains ascribed to the coordination between Bipy and QPZn. After thermal annealing was applied to the blended film processed with Bipy , the shoulder did not change significantly , indicating that the coordination was relatively stable . In conclusion , a series of end - capped donor - acceptor copolymers with T , QP , and QPZn as end - caps were synthesized and well characterized. Especially , P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn end - capped by porphyrins showed remarkably enhancement of light absorption in the short wavelength region. Bulk heterojunction PSCs based on these polymers were fabricated and the end - capped polymers showed significantly improved PCEs compared with the counterpart without end - caps. In addition , ligand addivie , Bipy , was applied to the photovoltaic devices based on P(BT-DPP)-QP and P(BT-DPP)-QPZn. The PCE of the photovoltaic device based on P(BT-DPP)-QPZn showed significantly improvement from 2.92% to 4.45% with the integrated optimization stratragies of using additives and thermal annealing. Furthermore , benefiting from the coordination effect between Bipy and QPZn , the blend film of P(BT-DPP)-QPZn:PC71BM and the corresponding photovoltaic device showed increased stability after using Bipy as additive. This work provides a new insight into designing donor - acceptor copolymers with multifunctional end - caps and exploring promising optimization stratragies of using ligand additives to achieve PSCs with both high - efficiency and long - term stability , which are critical for the devices to be commercially useful. c]pyrrole ( DPP ) were synthesized following modified procedures. 9,30 2,2′-Bithiophene-5,5′-bis(trimethylstannane) ( BT ) was prepared according to the reported procedure. 19 Other reagents and solvents were commercial grade and used without further purification unless otherwise stated .",

PTTBTz film possesses high thermal stability with 5% weight - loss temperature at 450 °C , a lower - lying HOMO energy level at -5.20 eV , a higher hole mobility of 6.45 × 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) , and a crystalline structure. Photovoltaic performance of the polymer was investigated with [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) or indene-C 60 bisadduct ( ICBA ) as acceptor and with 3% DIO additive. The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSC based on PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 w / w ) reached 5.35% with a high V oc of 1.03 V , a J sc of 8.55 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.608 , whereas the PCE of the PSC based on PTTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) was 4.57% with a V oc of 0.82 V , a J sc of 9.89 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.563 , under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2. PTTBTz is one of the D-A copolymers that shows better photovoltaic performance with ICBA as acceptor than PC 70 BM. PTTBTz / ICBA could be a promising front active layer for high - efficiency tandem PSC because of its high V oc . In recent years , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted considerable attention because of their advantages of low cost , easy fabrication , lightweight , and capability to be fabricated into flexible large - area devices. 1-5 Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure utilizing a conjugated polymer as donor and fullerene derivatives [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 60 BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) as acceptor now plays a leading role in realizing high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSCs. The key issue in the studies of PSCs is to increase the PCE of the devices. The factors that determine the PCE of the PSCs are the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , and fill factor ( FF ). V oc is proportional to the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of the donor. 6 Therefore , lower HOMO of the donor and higher LUMO of the acceptor will lead to higher V oc of the PSCs. The J sc is tightly related to the absorption and charge carrier mobility of the photovoltaic materials , and FF is influenced by the charge carrier mobility of the photoactive layer.",

    "sentence": "Only recently , Jenekhe et al. reported a D-A copolymer of dithionosilole and thiazolothiazole showing improved PCE of 5.36% with ICBA as acceptor in comparison with a PCE of 3.61% with PC 60 BM as acceptor. 32 Interestingly , our new D-A copolymer PTTBTz also showed better photovoltaic performance when ICBA was used as acceptor instead of PC 70 BM. PCE of the PSC based on PTTBTz as donor and ICBA as acceptor reached 5.35% with a high V oc of 1.03 V , under the illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2. The results are very important for understanding the applicability of the new acceptor ICBA for the D-A copolymer photovoltaic donor materials to get higher V oc and further improved efficiency . 3.1. Synthesis and Thermal Properties. PTTBTz was synthesized by Stille coupling reaction using Pd ( PPh 3 ) 4 as the catalyst. The polymer has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , toluene , chlorobenzene , odichorobenzene , and so on. The number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of PTTBTz is 6.73 K with a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 1.60. Thermal stability of the polymer was investigated with TGA. The TGA result ( see Figure 1a ) reveals that the onset temperatures with 5% weight - loss ( T d ) of PTTBTz is 450 ° C. This indicates that the thermal stability of PTTBTz is very good for the application in optoelectronic devices. To investigate possible crystallization in the copolymer films , the differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) was measured , as shown in Figure 1b. There is an apparent exothermic peak at 115 °C for PTTBTz indicating that there is some local crystallization in the polymer films. 3.2. X-ray Diffraction. To investigate further the crystalline property of PTTBTz , we measured the grazing - incidence XRD pattern of the polymer film , as shown in Figure 2. The XRD pattern of the pristine polymer film exhibits three diffraction peaks at 2θ = 6.45 , 13.63 , and 21.96 ° , respectively. The ( 100 ) and ( 200 ) diffraction peaks for PTTBTz are at 6.45 and 13.63 ° , respectively , indicating an ordered structure along with a d spacing of 13.68 Å that can be ascribed to the interchain distance separated by the alkyl side chains. The interchain d spacing of 13.68 Å is smaller than that ( ca. 16 Å ) 33 of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , which indicates more densely packed side chains in PTTBTz than in P3HT. The broad feature at 21.96 ° , corresponding to a distance of 4.02 Å , can be assigned to the facial π-π stacking between polymer backbones. The results indicate that PTTBTz possesses ordered polymer chains and densely packed side chains , which should be beneficial to higher hole mobility and better photovoltaic performance of the polymer. 3.3.

    "sentence": "Figure 3 shows the ultraviolet- visible ( UV - vis ) absorption spectra of the polymer dilute solution in chloroform and film spin - coated on quartz substrate. In solution , the polymer exhibited an absorption peak at 471 nm , which we assign to internal charge transfer between the TT donor unit and the BTz acceptor unit. The absorption maximum of the polymer film appeared at 532 nm ; a significant red shift of 61 nm relative to that in solution , indicating that considerably strong intermolecular interactions existed in the solid film. Additionally , a vibronic shoulder at 573 nm implies an ordered arrangement of PTTBTz in the solid film , with strong π-π stacking between the polymeric backbones , a feature that also appears in regioregular P3HT. The optical bandgap of PTTBTz , estimated from the onset wavelength ( ca. 660 nm ) of main absorption band of the polymer film , was 1.89 eV , which is similar to that of P3HT ( 1.91 eV ). 34 3.4. Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical CV was performed for determining the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers. 35 As shown in the CV of PTTBTz ( see Figure 4 ) , the onset reduction potential ( φ red ) is -1.81 V versus Ag / Ag + , and the onset oxidation potential ( φ ox ) is 0.49 V versus Ag / Ag + . The HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the electrochemical band gap ( E g EC ) of the polymer are -5.20 , -2.90 , and 2.20 eV , respectively , calculated from φ ox and φ red . 36 The HOMO energy level of PTTBTz is ca. 0.3 eV down - shifted in comparison with that ( -4.9 eV ) 37 of P3HT , which is beneficial to a higher V oc for the PSCs with the polymer as donor because V oc of PSCs is related to the difference of the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor. 6 3.5. Photovoltaic Properties. Photovoltaic properties of PTTBTz were investigated by fabricating the PSCs based on PTTBTz as donor and PC 70 BM or ICBA 28 as acceptor with the device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PTTBTz : acceptors / Ca / Al. Here ICBA was used as acceptor in the PSC to investigate the suitability of the new acceptor with the D-A copolymer donor. Figure 5 shows the current density - voltage characteristic of the device under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 , and Table 1 lists the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs based on PTTBTz as donor and PC 70 BM or ICBA as acceptor. PC 70 BM is a widely used acceptor , and the PSC based on PTTBTz : PC 70 BM 1 : 1 ( w / w ) demonstrated a V oc of 0.86 V , J sc of 6.43 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 0.445 , leading to a PCE of 2.17% .",

The PSC based on PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 w / w ) shows an even higher V oc of 1.02 V , a J sc of 4.50 mA cm^-2 , and an FF of 0.487 , leading to a PCE of 2.23% , which is almost the same as that of the device with PC 70 BM as acceptor. With 3% DIO additive treatment , a high PCE of 5.35% was achieved with a V oc of 1.03 V , J sc of 8.55 mA cm^-2 , and an FF of 0.608 , respectively. Obviously , the photovoltaic performance is improved greatly by using the 3% DIO additive for both PSCs with PC 70 BM and ICBA as acceptors. Most importantly , the PCE of the PSC with ICBA as acceptor is significantly higher than that of the PSC with PC 70 BM as acceptor for the D-A copolymer of PTTBTz. This is the second D-A copolymer besides the D-A copolymer of dithionosilole and thiazolothiazole 32 that shows much higher PCE with ICBA as acceptor than that with PC 70 BM as acceptor , although ICBA greatly improves the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on P3HT 30 and some other polythiophene derivatives 31 than PC 60 BM. Probably , the crystalline structure and relatively higher LUMO energy level of PTTBTz play important role in the high photovoltaic performance of the D-A copolymer blended with the new acceptor ICBA. In considering the similar absorption spectra of PTTBTz and P3HT and the high V oc of the PSC - based PTTBTz , PTTBTz could be a promising front - layer donor material instead of P3HT in tandem PSCs. It should be mentioned that the photovoltaic properties reported above are from the PSCs without thermal annealing. Actually , the thermal annealing on the PSCs in the temperature range from 80 to 120 °C for 10 min influenced the photovoltaic performance very little or decreased the photovoltaic performance a little , as shown in Figures S1 and S2 and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information. In addition , it deserves to notice that although the new acceptor ICBA improves the photovoltaic performance of P3HT greatly , only very few D-A copolymers 32 show better photovoltaic performance with the acceptor of ICBA than PCBM ( PC 60 BM or PC 70 BM ). The reasons could be as follows : ( 1 ) PCBM is crystalline material but ICBA is amorphous.",

    "sentence": "If the D-A copolymer is amorphous , when it is blended with PCBM the nanoscaled interpenetration network could be formed due to the crystalline aggregation of PCBM , but if the amorphous polymer is blended with the amorphous ICBA , then it will be difficult for the separate aggregation of the donor and acceptor to form the nanoscaled interpenetrating network. ( 2 ) The LUMO energy level ( -3.74 eV 28 ) of ICBA is ca. 0.17 eV up - shifted from that of PCBM ; if the LUMO energy level of the D-A copolymer is low , the smaller LUMO energy level difference between the D-A copolymer donor and the ICBA acceptor will decrease the efficiency of the exciton dissociation on the interface of the donor and acceptor , so that it decreases J sc and PCE of the PSCs. The success of the D-A copolymer PTTBTz here with ICBA acceptor could be benefitted from its crystalline structure and relatively higherlying LUMO energy levels ( -2.90 eV as mentioned above ). Anyway , we need more knowledge and polymer examples for understanding what kind of D-A copolymers will show further improved photovoltaic performance with ICBA as acceptor than PCBM. Probably , we also need to look for new solvent additive to improve the interpenetrating network morphology of the blend films of the D-A copolymers and ICBA in the PSCs. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the PSCs based on PTTBTz : acceptors ( 1 : 1 w / w ) with and without DIO additive is shown in Figure 6. The maximum EQE values of the PSC with PC 70 BM and ICBA as acceptor were 46 and 39% respectively without using DIO additive , and it increased to 73 and 68% , respectively , with 3% DIO additive. The EQE results agree well with the J sc of the corresponding PSCs mentioned above. 3.6. Hole Mobility. Hole mobility is an important parameter for the conjugated polymer donor photovoltaic materials. Here we measured the hole mobility of PTTBTz by space - charge limited current ( SCLC ) method by using a holeonly device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer / Au. For the hole - only devices , SCLC is described by 38 εε μ ≅ J V VEL L ( 9 / 8 ) exp(0.89 / ) / 0^0 2^0 3 ( 1 ) where ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer , ε 0 is the permittivity of the vacuum , μ 0 is the zero - field mobility , E 0 is the characteristic field , J is the current density , L is the thickness of the blended films layer , V = V appl - V bi , V appl is the applied potential , and V bi is the built-in potential that results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode ( in this device structure , V bi = 0.2 V ).",

    "sentence": "Figure 7 shows the ln(JL 3 / V 2 ) versus ( V / L ) 0.5 plot for the hole mobility measure - ment of PTTBTz. According to eq 1 , the hole mobility of PTTBTz was calculated to be 6.45 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . 3.7. Morphology. To understand the effect of 3% DIO additive , we investigated the morphology of the blend films by AFM ( as shown in Figure 8 ). It can be seen that with 3% DIO treatment the blend film demonstrated more uniform structure and better interpenetrating network than that of the film without DIO treatment. Two features are observed from the comparison : ( i ) From the height images , the surface processed with DIO is significantly rougher than that without using the solvent additive , with root-mean-square surface roughness of 8.5 nm for the PTTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 ) film with DIO additive ( Figure 8c ) compared with 3.3 nm for the PTTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 ) film without DIO ( Figure 8a ) or 20.4 nm for the PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 ) film with DIO additive ( Figure 8g ) compared with 5.1 nm for the PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 ) film without DIO ( Figure 8e ). Islands and valleys are apparent after adding DIO. It has been reported that a rough surface is a \" signature \" of high - efficiency PSCs in the treatment of both \" thermal annealing \" 39 and \" solvent annealing \" . 40 ( ii ) From the phase images , in the films with the additive , ordered crystalline domains of polymer are clearly visible , but they are absent in the films without the additive. This suggests that ordered chain alignment is achieved when using DIO as solvent additive. As a result , the device performance was greatly improved. These results proved that morphology control by using additive is an effective way to improve the performance of PSCs. For further confirming the ordered structure induced by the DIO additive , we measured the absorption spectra of the blend films of PTTBTz : PC 70 BM and PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 w / w ) with or without DIO additive , as shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. It can be seen that the absorbance of the blend films with DIO additive is more enhanced than that without DIO additive , which is consistent with the improved ordered structure of the blend films by DIO additive. Actually , AFM can only probe the surface of active layer. To probe further the morphology throughout the entire film , TEM was used to obtain a real - space image of the phase - separated morphology of the polymer - fullerene blends with or without 3% DIO , as shown in Figure 9.",

    "sentence": "The most pronounced feature of the films with DIO additive compared with that without DIO ( Figure 9b,d,f,h ) is the appearance of dark clusters in the film and high contrast of these clusters to the background. These clusters are reminiscent of TEM images by Yang et al. , 41 in which PC 70 BM - rich domains were developed during the annealing step. Similar to Yang 's work , the dark regions in Figure 9a are attributed as PC 70 BM clusters. Obviously , the DIO additive helped the formation of appropriate aggregation of the fullerene acceptors , which is beneficial to the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. Our results agree with the literature reports that DIO helps to increase the fullerene domain sizes and morphology of the blend films processed with additives showed larger scaled phase separation than that of the blend film without additive. 42-44 We synthesized a new D-A copolymer ( PTTBTz ) containing thienothiophene donor unit and bithiazole acceptor unit , by the Pd - catalyzed Stille - coupling method , for the application as donor materials in PSCs. PTTBTz film shows a similar absorption band and a higher hole mobility of 6.45 × 10^-3 cm^2 / V s as that of P3HT , but with ca. 0.3 eV lower - lying HOMO energy level at -5.20 eV. The photovoltaic performance of the polymer was improved significantly by using DIO additive and using ICBA as acceptor. The PCE of the PSC based on PTTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) reached 4.57% with J sc = 9.89 mA / cm^2 , V oc = 0.82 V , and FF = 0.563 , and the PSC based on PTTBTz : ICBA ( 1 : 1 w / w ) demonstrated a higher PCE of 5.35% with a high V oc of 1.03 V , a J sc of 8.55 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.608 , under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2. These results indicate that PTTBTz is a promising donor material for the application in tandem PSCs , and the new acceptor ICBA could also be used as an efficiency acceptor in the PSCs based on crystalline D-A copolymer donors. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information I-V curves and photovoltaic performances of the PSCs based on PTTBTz : ICBA and PTTBTz : PC 70 BM and absorption spectra of blend films.

    "sentence": "Fused - ring units as building blocks have been used to develop highly efficient D-A copolymers for bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells due to their unique advantages , such as extended conjugation length , reduced bandgap , enhanced light - absorbance , stronger interchain interaction , and high charge carrier mobility. 1 Replacing thiophene with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( TT ) is an effective approach to develop new fused - ring units ( Fig. 1 ). 2 TT can promote polymer packing and improve charge carrier mobility. 2a Durrant et al. reported a new donor unit dithienogermolodithiophene ( DTTG ) , in which two TT units are connected through a dialkylgermanium unit. pDTTG-TPD:PC71BM solar cells exhibit efficiencies up to 7.2% . 2b Hou et al. developed a two - dimensional donor unit DTBDT and its copolymer PDT-S-T gives a higher PCE ( 7.79% ) than polymer PBDTTT-S-T ( 5.93% ). 2c Jen and Cheng independently reported new heptacyclic ladder - type donor unit IDTT via replacing terminal thiophenes of IDT with TT. IDTT building block endows D-A copolymers with extended conjugation length , better lightharvesting capability , enhanced charge mobilities and better photovoltaic performance. 2a,2d In addition , TT can also be used as a π-bridge , which used to be thiophene , furan or selenophene. 3 The above mentioned approach is rarely used to develop new fused - ring acceptor units as far as we know. Recently , we have developed a series of lactam acceptor units and their copolymers show good photovoltaic performance. 4 PThTPTI consisting of thieno [ 2',3' : 5,6]pyrido [3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione ( TPTI ) and thiophene afforded efficiencies up to 9.20% . 4b In this work , two thiophenes at the end of TPTI were replaced by TT to produce a new heptacyclic acceptor unit thieno [ 2'',3'' : 4',5']thieno[2',3' : 5,6]pyrido [3,4g]thieno [ 2',3' : 4,5]thieno [3,2-c]isoquinoline-1,8(2H,9H)-dione ( TTP , Fig. 1 ). The centrosymmetric TTP contains seven fused aromatic rings with two TTs , one benzene , and two pyridones. D-A copolymer PBDTTTP was synthesized by copolymerizing TTP with benzo [1,2b:4,5-b']dithiophene ( BDT ). PBDTTTP possesses a deep HOMO level and an optical bandgap of 2.11 eV. PBDTTTP : PC71BM solar cells gave a PCE of 5.53% , which is higher than that of its analogue PBDTTPTI. 3 kDa with a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 4.00 , estimated by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using THF as eluent. As determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) ( Fig. S3 ) , the decomposition temperature ( T d ) of PBDTTTP is 329 °C , suggesting its good thermal stability for photovoltaic application. The optical properties of PBDTTTP were studied by UV - vis absorption spectroscopy. PBDTTTP solution and thin film show similar absorption spectra with two peaks ( Fig. 2 ). The strongest absorption peaks locate at 553 and 556 nm , and the second peaks at 512 and 514 nm , respectively. From solution to solid state , the red shift is ~ 3 nm. Aggregation might also exist in solution.",

    "sentence": "The optical bandgap for PBDTTTP is 2.11 eV , which is larger than that of pentacyclic TPTI analogue PBDTTPTI ( 2.03 eV ). 5 From TPTI to TTP , the conjugation system was extended , while the absorption spectrum shows a blue shift. The aromatic feature for the copolymer might get stronger when extending TPTI unit to TTP unit. 6,7 X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) pattern of pure polymer film is shown in Fig. 3. The two peaks at 4.62º and 24.25º correspond to an interlayer d-spacing of 19.11 Å and a π-π stacking d-spacing of 3.67 Å , respectively. The peak at 4.62º indicates that PBDTTTP is partially crystalline , which is necessary for high hole mobility. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) of polymer thin film was measured ( Fig. S4 ). PBDTTTP has an oxidation onset potential ( E ox on ) of 0.63 V and a reduction onset potential ( E red on ) of -2.20 V , and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are determined to be -5.43 eV and -2.60 eV , respectively. The deep HOMO level favours device to produce a high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ). 8 To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of PBDTTTP , solar cells with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PBDTTTP : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated. After systematic optimization , the best device had a D / A ratio of 1 : 1 ( w / w ) , an active layer thickness of 149 nm , with 3 vol % 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) in chlorobenzene. DIO is widely used in polymer : fullerene solar cells , and it can inhibit fullerene to form large aggregates and increase D-A interfaces in the active layers , thus increasing photocurrent and improving photovoltaic performance. Solar cells without DIO exhibited a very low PCE of 0.77% with a small J sc of 1.53 mA / cm^2 ( Fig. 4a and Table 1 ). After adding 1 vol % DIO , the efficiency increased over five times to 5.18% with a higher J sc of 7.88 mA / cm^2 and a higher FF of 68.3% . Devices with 3 vol % DIO gave the highest PCE of 5.53% with a V oc of 0.98 V , a J sc of 8.12 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 69.5% . This efficiency is higher than that of TPTI analogue PBDTTPTI ( 5.30% ). 5 The significant improvements in J sc were confirmed by EQE spectra ( Fig. 4b ). Solar cells without DIO show EQE below 14% in the range of 300-750 nm with an integrated current of 1.57 mA / cm^2. After adding 3 vol % DIO , the EQE soared to 60% in the range of 460-558 nm with an integrated current of 7.81 mA / cm^2. Morphologies for PBDTTTP : PC71BM blend films were studied by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Fig. 5 ).",

    "sentence": "The film without DIO exhibited large fullerene domains with diameters of a few hundred nanometers , while the film with 3 vol % DIO became uniform and showed fine nano-structures , which might provide more D-A interfaces for producing high photocurrent. Charge carrier mobilities for the blend films were measured by space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method ( Fig. 6 ). The electron mobilities for PBDTTTP : PC71BM blend films without or with 3 vol % DIO are 1.86 × 10^-6 and 3.19 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. This suggests that DIO addition can significantly increase electron mobility. On the other side , the hole mobilities for the blend films without or with 3 vol % DIO are 6.85 × 10^-4 and 4.03 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . With DIO , hole / electron mobilities in the active layer are more balanced , leading to higher J sc and FF .",

Along with the morphological optimization of the active layer made of blends of p - type polymers : n - type fullerenes , over 7-8 % of power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) in single - junction BHJ PSCs have been realized. 2,3 Moreover , interfacial layer modifications 4 and novel device architectures promoted the PCEs of multiple - junction BHJ PSCs to over 9-10 % . 5 Modulation of the molecular energy levels of the D-A copolymers via replacing the chalcogenophene ( CP ) π-bridges ( i.e. , furan-2,5-diyl ( -Fu- ) , thiophene-2,5-diyl ( -Th- ) and seleno-phene-2,5-diyl ( -Se- ) groups ) have been widely adopted because of the ready availability of the CP units and their significant influences on the molecular properties. In general , copolymers using -Fu-π-bridges have better solubility , 6 lowerlying highest occupied molecular orbital level ( E HOMO ) , and deliver higher open circuit voltage ( V oc ) than their counterparts. 7 Those employing -Se-π-bridges generally possess more quinoidal character , stabilized E LUMO and narrower E g . 8,9 Consequently , higher charge mobility ( μ ) in organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) and short - circuit current ( J sc ) in BHJ PSCs were delivered by the devices utilizing the -Secopolymers. 10 P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) in Scheme 1a is one of the poly(5,6-difluorobenzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole-4,7-diyl-alt-quaterchalcogenophene) ( P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) ) copolymers. It has high crystallinity in the solid - state , delivers high hole mobility ( μ h ) in organic fieldeffect transistors ( OFETs ) and has 6.8% power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) in BHJ PSCs. 11 However , due to the relatively large E g of P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) , the PCE of the P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) : PC71BM PSCs was limited by the low J sc . In attempts to improve the performances of the P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) , and to investigate the influences of the -Se-π-bridges on the P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) copolymer , in this study , a novel P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) copolymer , P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) , was synthesized. Replacing the -Thwith the -Se-π-bridges effectively narrows the E g to 1.56 eV , and results in high J sc of the P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) : PC71BM PSCs. The P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) : PC71BM PSCs delivered a J sc of 15.8 mA cm^-2 , and the best PCE of 7.34% .",

The process additive , 1-chloronaphthalene , was used to optimize the active layer morphology. The significant changes in the molecular and morphological behaviors caused by the -Se-π-bridges were further scrutinized by morphological analyses and theoretical calculations. It was found that the larger atomic size of selenium improves the backbone linearity , which enhances the aggregation strength and solid - state order of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ). Synthesis of monomers and polymers The synthetic route to P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) is depicted in Scheme 1b. A Pd - catalyzed Stille - coupling reaction between 5,6-difluoro-4,7-diiodobenzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole ( 1 ) and 2-(tributylstannyl)selenophene afforded the formation of 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(selenophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole ( SeFBT ) in a 89% yield. Lithiation of the SeFBT by lithium diisopropylamide ( LDA ) followed by reacting with trimethyltin chloride resulted in the formation of 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)selenophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole ( Sn-SeFBT ) in 57% yield. Sn-SeFBT was then copolymerized with 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene by Stillecoupling to give P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ). The number average molecular weights ( M n ) and polydispersity index ( PDI ) are 14.7 kDa and 1.38 , respectively , for P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 140 °C . The absorption spectra for the P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) in o-dichlorobenzne ( ODCB ) solution and thin film are shown in Fig. 1. In the solution , the absorption bands with λ max s at 430 nm and at 662 nm are attributed to the localized π-π* transition and the photo - induced intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) band of the copolymer. The optical band - gaps ( E g ) deduced from the absorption edges of the thin film spectrum is 1.56 eV. Compared to P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) , 11 P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) exhibited more bathochromic absorption of the ICT band in solution and in the solid state due to the selenophenes introducing more quinoidal character to conjugated polymer backbones. 8d,9 Deduced from cyclic voltammetry measurements ( Fig. S1 † ) , the E HOMO and E LUMO of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) are -5.39 eV and -3.70 eV , respectively. Compared to the E HOMO and E LUMO of P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) , 11 the smaller E g of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) is a result of the elevation of E HOMO as shown in Fig. S1b. † The result is unexpected , because in the previous cases , 8a,d,e the narrower E g of the -Seanalogues was a result of the deeper - lying E LUMO s instead of the raised E HOMO s.

The μ h of solution - processed P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) thin films was measured using a bottom-gate , top - contact device configuration with evaporated gold source / drain electrodes and octadecyltrichlorosilane ( ODTS ) modified SiO 2 gate dielectric on n - doped silicon wafer surface. The output and transfer plots ( at the same source - drain voltages of -80 V ) of the devices exhibited typical p-channel OFET characteristics ( Fig. 3 ). The μ h s were obtained from the transfer characteristics of the devices in the saturation regime. P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) exhibited a high μ h of 0.36 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with a good on - off ratio of 1.91 × 10^6 . Since the solid - state packing of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) and P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) is similar , the μ h of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) is only slightly better than that of P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) ( μ h = 0.29 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). 11 To evaluate the photovoltaic performances of the copolymers , BHJ PSCs with conventional architecture -ITO / PEDOT : PSS / P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) : PC71BM ( 1 : 1 in wt % ) / Ca / Aland inverted architecture -ITO / ZnO / P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) : PC71BM ( 1 : 1 in wt % ) / MoO 3 / Agwere fabricated.

As shown in Fig. 5a , deep dark spots were observed in the P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) : PC71BM thin film prepared from the ODCB solution. The deep dark spots were assigned as the polymer - rich domains , because of the higher atomic scattering factor of the selenium atoms of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ).",

    "sentence": "Fig. 5b shows the image of the dark spot at a higher magnification. Stacks of dark lines , which are separated uniformly with a distance of ∼ 0.37 nm , were observed inside the dark spot. The distance matches the d-spacing of the π-π stacking , and further confirmed the dark regions as the polymer - rich domains. The results indicated that P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) tends to segregate into large domains in the active layer. To decrease the degree of segregation , 1-CN was used as an additive. With 8 vol % of 1-CN , the population of large dark spots decreased as shown in Fig. 5c. A more homogeneous morphology , which contains interpenetrating polymer - rich ( darker regions ) , and polymer - deficient ( brighter regions ) , was obtained. Although deep dark spots can still be observed in the thin - film ( Fig. 5d ) , their sizes are significantly decreased. Therefore , 1-CN effectively suppressed the segregation of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) , and facilitates the formation of a more homogeneous active morphology. The morphological changes increased the J sc of the P(FBTalt-Se 2 Th 2 ) : PC71BM PSCs. The PSCs prepared with 8 vol % of 1-CN gave a J sc of 14.3 mA cm^-2 and a PCE of 6.31% . In inverted PSCs , an even higher PCE of 7.34% with a V oc of 0.70 V , a J sc of 15.8 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 66.4% was delivered. Compared to P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) : PC71BM PSCs , which delivered a PCE of 6.82% with a V oc of 0.77 V , a J sc of 13.5 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 65.6% , 11 the higher - lying E HOMO of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) caused negative impact on the V oc . However , when the morphology of the P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) : PC71BM active thin film is optimized , the narrower E g of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) promoted the J sc and resulted in an overall higher PCE of over 7% . The molecular properties , solution and solid - state behaviors of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) and P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) revealed the remarkable influences of the -CP-π-bridges to the properties of the P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) copolymers. The much stronger aggregation tendency of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) significantly affected the solidstate morphology and consequently the performances of the copolymers. Intermolecular non-covalent interactions and molecular geometries are both essential in the aggregation and self - assembly processes. 14 To understand the possible causes of the different aggregation strengths , the dipole moments of the SeFBT structural units , and the optimized conformations of the repeat units of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) and P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) were further investigated through theoretical calculations.

    "sentence": "The result was obtained via theoretical calculations performed with the Gaussian09 suite employing the WB97XD density functional in combination with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. It was found that the dipole moments of SeFBT are comparable to that of 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole ( ThFBT ). 11 Thus , the variation in the π-bridges does not significantly change the dipole moments of the acceptor structural units. In this case , the stronger aggregation tendency of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) can not be simply attributed to difference in the molecular dipole moment. Fig. 6 shows the optimized conformations of the repeat units of the two P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) copolymers. The conformations were obtained through theoretical calculation at the WB97XD / 6-311G ( d,p ) level of density functional theory. The 2-octyldodecyl side chains were replaced by isobutyl groups to keep the branched geometry of the alkyl groups , but avoid excessive computation demand. The calculated bond angles ( θ ) and bond lengths ( L ) were summarized in Table 2. θ 1 and θ 2 are the interannular dihedral angles between the CP unit and its neighboring aromatic units. These angles are nearly identical in both repeat units. Therefore , as can be seen from the side view in Fig. 6 , the coplanarity of both repeat units in Fig. 6 Top views and side views of the optimized geometries of the repeat units of P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) and P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) at the WB97XD / 6-311G ( d,p ) level of theory. The atoms are shown in the following colors : sulfur ( yellow ) , selenium ( orange ) , fluorine ( light blue ) , carbon ( gray ) , nitrogen ( blue ) , and hydrogen ( light gray ). their optimized geometries is similar. The main geometrical difference in the repeat units can be found within the -Thand the -Seunits. Because the van der Waals radius of selenium ( 1.90 Å ) is larger than that of sulfur ( 1.80 Å ) , 15 the -Seunit has longer carbon-heteroatom bonds ( L 1 and L 2 ) , and a wider included angle θ 3 . Along the chain axis , the wider θ 3 makes the repeat unit of P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) less curved than that of P(FBT-alt-Th 4 ) , as can be seen from the top view of the repeat units in Fig. 6. In summary , the theoretical calculations indicate that the variation in the -CP-π-bridges affects more on the linearity of the repeat units than on the molecular dipole moment and the coplanarity of the repeat units. Thus , it is likely that P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) possess stronger aggregation strength because of its more linear backbone geometry. The interannular bond lengths of the repeat units were also and summarized in Table S1. † These lengths are essentially identical in both repeat units . A novel P(FBT-alt-CP 4 ) copolymer , P(FBT-alt-Se 2 Th 2 ) , was designed and synthesized.",

The TPD - containing polymers had optical band gaps of 1.50 - 1.70 eV and HOMO levels of -4.85 to -5.26 eV. The highly electron - rich character of dialkoxybithiophene in P1 and P2 destabilizes their HOMOs which significantly affects the photovoltaic efficiency. However , polymer P3 containing cyclopentadithiophene donor units results in a deeper HOMO level of -5.26 eV. The field - effect mobility of holes varied from 2 x 10^-4 cm^2 / ( V s ) in P2 to ∼ 1 x 10^-2 cm^2 / ( V s ) in P3 - based transistors. BHJ solar cells using polymer P1 or P2 as the electron donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid ester ( PC71BM ) as the electron acceptor exhibit low open circuit voltages ( V oc = 0.40 - 0.60 V ) and power conversion efficiencies below 1.5% . However , BHJ solar cells based on the TPD-cyclopentadithiophene copolymer ( P3 ) achieved a high V oc of ∼ 0.8 V and power conversation efficiency greater than 3% . These results demonstrate the tuning of the open circuit voltage and thus the photovoltaic efficiency of BHJ solar cells based on copolymers containing thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione acceptor . Organic polymer - based solar cells have great potential as alternative clean energy sources due to the low cost of device fabrication using solution - based processing technology and their mechanical flexibility which is compatible with foldable or rollable substrates. [1][2][3][4] The performance of polymer solar cells has been significantly improved in the past decade through optimization of device structure , 1 interfacial layer engineering , [5][6][7] processing condition , [8][9][10][11] and synthesis of new high - performance polymer semiconductors. [12][13][14][15][16][17] To date , the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) device architecture using polymer semiconductors as electron donors and high-electron-affinity fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as electron acceptors has proven to be the most successful concept in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). 1,18,19 Power conversion efficiencies of greater than 7% have recently been achieved by using new donor - acceptor copolymer semiconductors and optimizing device processing conditions. 14,20,21 Although the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of polymer solar cells has been significantly improved in the past decade , 20 their performance is still much lower than their inorganic counterparts , such as silicon , GaAs , CdTe , and CIGS , 22 which prevents the practical applications in large scale. Design and synthesis of new polymer semiconductors with appropriate band gap and frontier molecular orbitals ( FMOs ) is one of the key approaches to improving the PCE of polymer solar cells.",

    "sentence": "12,13,15 The target materials should have appropriate band gaps with high absorption coefficient to efficiently harvest solar irradiation and also have appropriate energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( LUMOs ) for efficient exciton dissociation at the donor / acceptor interface and deep highest occupied molecular orbitals ( HOMOs ) for achieving high open circuit voltage ( V oc ) and device stability. 16,[23][24][25] The relatively high HOMO energy of P3HT significantly limits the V oc and thus PCE of the most studied P3HT / PCBM solar cells. 26 Furthermore , the donor polymers and acceptor fullerenes should segregate to a bicontinuous network with domain widths within twice the exciton diffusion length to facilitate the dissociation of excitons at donor / acceptor interfaces and to provide efficient pathways for the dissociated charges to reach their respective electrodes. However , it is challenging to tailor all these features in one single polymer component. The development of PBT7 27 demonstrates how to synergistically integrate the desired properties to increase device performance. PBT7 has a band gap of 1.60 eV which enables efficient harvesting of solar irradiation around the region with the highest photon flux of the solar spectrum ( ∼ 700 nm ) and a low HOMO level of -5.15 eV which facilitates a high V oc ( 0.75 eV ). BHJ solar cells based on PTB7 / PC71BM exhibit a PCE up to 7.4% after optimizing the film morphology to form a nanoscale interpenetrating network. 27 The donor - acceptor ( D-A ) strategy has been demonstrated to be efficient in not only band - gap engineering but also tuning of the energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals ( FMOs ). 28,29 Among different acceptor units , imide - functionalized arenes are an interesting class of building blocks and are gaining more attention due to their solubilizing ability and electronic structures. Recently , they have been successfully used as acceptor units in the construction of high - performance D-A polymer semiconductors 30 for applications in organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) and polymer solar cells. Alternating D-A copolymers using naphthalene diimide ( NDI ) 31 and perylene diimide ( PDI ) 32 as electron acceptor units have demonstrated high electron mobilities [33][34][35] and high - mobility ambipolar charge transport , 36 and all - polymer solar cells using PDI - based polymers as acceptor layer showed a promising efficiency of up to 1.5% PCE. 37 Furthermore , D-A copolymers constructed from bithiophene imide 38 and phthalimide 39 have also demonstrated good hole mobilities in OFETs. We have previously demonstrated that phthalimide - based D-A copolymer PhBT12 is promising as donor component for applications in BHJ solar cells. 40 We concurrently 41 began studies using thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) , 42,43 an obvious next step , as the acceptor unit in D-A polymer semiconductors ( Figure 1 ). TPD 's geometry and electronic structure make it an intriguing acceptor unit.",

    "sentence": "On the basis of comparison of aromatic resonance energy of benzene ( 1.56 eV ) and thiophene ( 1.26 eV ) , polymers based on TPD should in principle have decreased bond - length alternation. 17,29 Furthermore , TPD 's geometry should present decreased steric repulsion to neighboring backbone units , and potentially attractive sulfuroxygen interactions could assist backbone planarization. [44][45][46] TPD - based D-A copolymers should , therefore , have smaller band gaps than the corresponding phthalimide - based copolymers and potentially closer intermolecular π-π interactions for efficient charge transport. In this paper , we report the synthesis and characterization of three new D-A copolymer semiconductors based on TPD and their initial applications in BHJ solar cells and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ). Partially due to their donor - acceptor repeating structure , the new polymers show lower band gaps in comparison to that of the most studied P3HT , 26 which can lead to better absorption of solar irradiation. OFETs fabricated from P3 achieved a hole mobility ( μ h ) of 8.9 x 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) and current modulation ( I on / I off ) of 10^5 . Photovoltaic properties of the new polymers were investigated by fabricating BHJ devices using these polymers as donor and PC71BM as acceptor. An average power conversion efficiency of 3.06% was achieved for P3 with a high V oc of ∼ 0.8 V. Because of promising charge transport properties of pure P3 film and the relatively high V oc of P3 / PC71BM cells , we believe the device performance of polymer P3 analogues can be further improved by optimizing the side chains of P3 as well as device fabrication conditions. While we were preparing this report other groups have recently obtained highly efficient solar cells ( 4.2 - 6.8% PCE ) [47][48][49][50] from a D-A copolymer with TPD as acceptor and benzodithiophene as donor. The current study adds to this body of work by revealing the effects of combining other donors and substituents with the highly promising TPD acceptor . Polymer molecular weight is an important factor that can affect the device performance of OFETs 53 and solar cells. 54 The electron - deficient TPD monomers are ideal coupling partner with electron - rich distannylated thiophene monomers , leading to high number - average molecular weights from 32 kDa for P1 to 55 kDa for P2 and to 64 kDa for P3 , and the high isolated yields indicate excellent conversion. Resolved 1H NMR spectra of polymers P1-P3 ( Supporting Information , Figures S1-S3 ) could be obtained only at elevated temperature ( 130 °C ) due to aggregation. However , no 13 °C signals arising from polymer backbones could be observed even after 12 h collection at 130 ° C.",

    "sentence": "Compared to our previously reported phthalimide analogue PhBT12 having identical side chains and a molecular weight of 207.5 kDa , 39 P1 has about 1 order of magnitude lower molecular weight , which could be due to its relatively low solubility , resulting in termination of polymerization at an earlier stage. The lower molecular weight and the poor processability of P1 can be the factors which affect the film morphology and limit the carrier mobility in OFET devices. 53 Replacing the n-dodecyl TPD substituent in P1 with 2-butyloctyl in P2 imparts better solubility and processability. Despite the fused - ring structure of cyclopentadithiophene ( CDT ) , copolymer P3 shows decent solubility which can be ascribed to the out - of - plane orientation of the alkyl chains on the CDT unit. Polymers P2 and P3 can be dissolved at higher concentrations at lower temperature than P1 in chlorinated solvents. Optical Properties. Absorption spectra were recorded from chlorobenzene solution ( 1 x 10^-5 M ) and thin films ( Figure 2 ) , and the related data are collected in Table 1. The absorption maxima are 675 , 680 , and 688 nm for as-cast films of P1 , P2 , and P3 , respectively. The thin films of these polymers exhibit both an absorption maximum and a shoulder , which are similar to the vibronic structures seen in regioregular polythiophene spectra. 55 From solution to thin film , no significant differences were observed in the absorption spectra for all three polymers , which indicate some degree of rigid chain conformation and / or aggregation 56,57 in solution at room temperature. In molecularly dissolved solutions , absorption spectra are usually broad and featureless , reflecting random thermal population of rotational states. Thermochromism of P1 solutions ( Figure 2 ; for P2 and P3 , see Figures S5 and S6 ) is manifested by blue shifts in the absorption profile with increasing temperature. From room temperature to 100 °C , the absorption maximum of P1 solution was blue - shifted by 25 nm from 748 to 723 nm. This could correspond to increased torsional activity or changes in aggregation number. The optical band gaps of polymer films calculated from absorption edges are 1.50 , 1.50 , and 1.67 eV for P1 , P2 , and P3 , respectively , which are much smaller than the optical band gap of P3HT ( ∼ 1.90 eV ) , 58 due to their donor - acceptor makeup. 59 As predicted , the band gap of P1 is smaller than that of the analogous phthalimide polymer PhBT12 ( 1.64 eV ) with the same donor unit. 39 The 0.17 eV narrower band gap of P1 and P2 compared to that of P3 is ascribed to the stronger electron - donating capability of dialkoxybithiophene units relative to cyclopentadithiophene units. Although potentially enhancing absorption of solar energy due to decreased band gap , these stronger donors destabilize HOMO energy levels which can limit V oc in PSCs ( vide infra ).

    "sentence": "The high - lying HOMO of P1 ( -4.85 eV ) is due to the electron - rich character of the dialkoxybithiophene units. Interestingly , although polymers P1 and P2 have the same backbone structure and the same optical band gap , the onset of oxidation for P2 is 0.2 V more positive. This effect might be attributed to changes in solid - state ordering , e.g. , backbone torsion or π-contacts. A similar change of HOMO levels was also observed in other TPD - based polymer semiconductors , when n-octyl chains were replaced with branched 3,7-dimethyloctyl chains. 49 The calculated HOMO energy is -5.26 eV for P3 , which is about 0.2 eV deeper than that of P2 and 0.4 eV deeper than P1. The low - lying HOMO of P3 is due to the synergetic interaction between the weak Field - Effect Transistors. Thin films of P1-P3 with a thickness of 30-50 nm were deposited onto octyltrichlorosilane (OTS8)-modified silicon / silicon dioxide substrates to evaluate charge transport properties of these polymers. 36,39 All devices were fabricated by employing the bottom-gate bottom - contact configuration , and all the polymers showed typical hole - transport properties ( Figure S10 ). Unlike P1 and P2 , a superlinear increase was seen in the output curves of P3 ( Figure S10 ). This is likely caused by contact resistance between gold electrodes ( work function ∼ 5.1 eV ) and the deeper HOMO level of P3 ( -5.26 eV ). Among the new polymers , P3 showed the highest average hole mobility of 8.9 x 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) with an I on / I off ratio greater than 10^5 ( Figure 3 ). P1 and P2 exhibited hole mobilities of 7.2 x 10^-4 and 2.0 x 10^-4 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively ( Table 2 and Figure S11 ) , which are an order of magnitude lower than that of P3. Thermal annealing at temperatures between 110 and 200 °C did not have a significant effect on the OFET characteristics of the polymers ( Table 2 and Figure S11 ). The independence of the carrier mobility on annealing temperature is also expected as we were unable to detect any thermal transitions by DSC within the range of the study ( 110-200 ° C ) ( Figure S4 ). More or less subtle changes were noted in room - temperature thin - film UV / vis absorption spectra after annealing at 180 °C for 30 min ( Figure S12 ). The low - energy shoulders in the spectra for P1 and P2 become more pronounced after annealing , while for P3 , fine structure actually decreases. Film microstructures and surface morphology were investigated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). It is interesting to compare the X-ray diffraction patterns of films of P1 and our previously reported phthalimide - based analogue PhBT12.",

    "sentence": "39 The film of PhBT12 shows intermediate and wide - angle diffraction maxima , indicating lamellar ordering and close π-stacking distance of 3.6 Å , while the diffractogram from P1 is essentially featureless. In fact , all the TPD - based polymers ( thin films on glass ) reported here do not give rise to any observable Bragg reflections ( Figure 4 ) when using a θ-2θ geometry. Furthermore , the AFM images ( Figure 5 ) of polymer films on the transistor surfaces are featureless with rms roughness lower than 1 nm ; no terrace - like structures or nanofibrillar morphology was detected , which are frequently seen in highly ordered polymer semiconductors. 39,61,62 Though it will require further studies ( e.g. , grazing - incidence X-ray diffraction , GIXD ) to confirm , the replacement of benzene in phthalimide - based PhBT12 with thiophene in P1 may actually severely curtail long - range solid - state order , contrary to our predictions. This could account for the more than 2 orders of magnitude lower mobility of P1 than that of PhBT12. Although XRD and AFM suggest amorphous microstructures for polymer P3 , a moderate field - effect mobility was achieved for this material. The amorphous character of the polymer can be beneficial for the reproducibility of device performance during the device fabrication. 63 Photovoltaic Devices. Photovoltaic properties of P1 , P2 , and P3 were evaluated after fabricating bulk heterojunction solar cells using fullerene derivative PC71BM as acceptor. Two sets of solar cells with polymer / PC71BM composition of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 ( wt : wt ) were fabricated. The films have a thickness of 80-90 nm , and all the solar cells have an active area of 9 mm 2 . The device size used in this study is much larger than our previously reported PhBT12 solar cells ( 4 mm 2 ) 40 to minimize overestimation of the photovoltaic performance and for more consistent comparison among different laboratories. The current density - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the solar cells measured under dark and 100 mW / cm^2 AM1.5 simulated sunlight and the absorption spectra of the blend films measured from the solar cells are shown in Figure 6. The photovoltaic parameters of the solar cells are summarized in Table 3. The short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and the fill factor ( FF ) observed in 1 : 1 P1 : PC71BM solar cells are 3.56 mA / cm^2 , 0.45 V , and 0.49 , respectively , resulting in an average power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 0.78% . When the composition of P1 : PC71BM increased to 1 : 2 , the PCE was improved to 1.44% with the J sc greatly increased to 7.39 mA / cm^2 and the V oc and FF slightly decreased to 0.41 V and 0.48 , respectively.",

    "sentence": "It is obvious that the more than doubled J sc accounts for the efficiency improvement in the 1 : 2 solar cells. Comparison of the absorption profiles of the pure polymer and the blends suggests that the enhanced current density in the 1 : 2 blends could in part be due to increased light absorption at wavelengths below 620 nm , but nanoscale morphology changes may play a more important role. The higher loading of fullerene in the 1 : 2 solar cells may lead to formation of mixed polymer / fullerene phases together with more continuous fullerene pathways for electron transport. 64 Solar cells based b , d ).

The average PCE achieved in the 1 : 1 P3 : PC71BM solar cells was 1.76% with the J sc , V oc , and FF of 5.76 mA / cm^2 , 0.79 V , and 0.39 , respectively. When the ratio of P3 : PC71BM changed to 1 : 2 , the average PCE was improved to 3.06% . The peak efficiency achieved in P3 : PC71BM ( 1 : 2 ) solar cells was 3.15% with J sc , V oc , and FF of 8.29 mA / cm^2 , 0.76 V , and 0.50 , respectively. Different from P1 solar cells , in which increasing fullerene loading only led to improved J sc , both J sc and FF were greatly enhanced in 1 : 2 P3 : PC71BM solar cells relative to 1 : 1 P3 : PC71BM solar cells ( Table 3 ) , indicating more balanced charge transport in the 1 : 2 composition. The observed very different photovoltaic properties of P1 , P2 , and P3 , as seen in Figure 6 and Table 3 , come from the variation in J sc ; the highest J sc was achieved in P3 solar cells and the lowest in P2 solar cells. It is obvious that the difference in the J sc can not be merely explained by the different absorption intensity as all the blend films have very similar absorption spectra and intensity ( Figure 6d ). The hole mobility of the polymers is one of the reasons for the variation in J sc ; the highest photocurrent density was observed in highest hole mobility P3 - based solar cells. However , the hole mobility itself can not explain the very low J sc of P2 solar cells since the hole mobilities of P2 and P1 are of the same order of magnitude.",

    "sentence": "As already well - known , morphology plays a great role in the efficiency of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. 3,11 To better understand the origin of the photovoltaic performance difference in the polymer solar cells , AFM images were collected ( Figure 7 ). Separated toroid - shaped domains with micrometer sizes can be clearly seen in the P2 : PC71BM ( 1 : 2 ) film , indicating reduced interfacial area for exciton dissociation and a lack of effective percolation for charge transport in the blend film. 65 This means only charges dissociated near the electrodes can be collected , which explains the very low and composition - independent photocurrent density. In contrast , nanoscale phase separation is observed in both P1 : PC71BM and P3 : PC71BM blend films , resulting in higher photocurrent density from better exciton dissociation and more efficient charge transport. Compared to P1 : PC71BM , P3 : PC71BM film shows a clearer and more interconnected biphasic nanostructure , accounting for the higher photocurrent density in this film. Interestingly , from polymer P1 , to P2 , and to P3 , the V oc of the solar cells increases from 0.45 to 0.59 V and to 0.79 V ( 1 : 1 polymer / PC71BM solar cells ). The replacement of linear side chains in P1 by the branched side chains in P2 results in ∼ 0.2 V increase of V oc , and this enhancement is in good agreement with the electrochemically estimated HOMO levels ( Table 1 ). Furthermore , replacement of strongly donating dialkoxybithiophene units in P1 with cyclopentadithiophene units in P3 leads to ∼ 0.4 V increase in V oc , also in perfect agreement with electrochemical estimation of HOMO energy levels. The stronger electron releasing capability of dialkoxybithiophene units destabilizes the HOMOs in polymers P1 and P2. The variation of the photovoltaic properties of these new polymers indicates that strong acceptor and weak donor could be ideal partners 16,66 for constructing high - performance donor - acceptor polymers with appropriate band gap and frontier molecular orbitals for application in BHJ solar cells. 67 In summary , we have incorporated the electron - deficient unit , TPD , into three new donor - acceptor copolymer semiconductors for applications in BHJ solar cells and field - effect transistors. These donor - acceptor copolymers provide intermediate band gaps ( 1.5 - 1.7 eV ) with variable HOMO energy levels ( -4.9 to -5.3 eV ) suitable for tuning the photovoltaic properties of BHJ solar cells. In marked contrast to phthalimide - based polymer PhBT12 , thin films of all the TPD - based polymers reported here do not defract X-rays in a typical θ-2θ instrument or exhibit c , f ) blend films. The dimension is 5 x 5 μm for all the images , the height is 30 nm for topography images , and the scale is 30 deg for the phase images.",

    "sentence": "A novel double cable donor - acceptor poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) derivative ( PCBM-Ph-P3HT ) was successfully synthesized via a facile postpolymerization approach followed by a Steglich esterification reaction , which was doped in a P3HT : PCBM ( PCBM = [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ) blend solution so as to study its effect on the device performance of P3HT : PCBM bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells ( BHJ - PSCs ). The successful attachment of PCBM as the side chain onto the P3HT backbone via a phenyl group is confirmed by both 1H NMR and UV - Vis spectroscopic studies. The fluorescence intensity of PCBM-Ph-P3HT in chlorobenzene shows x 63% quenching of the fluorescence of P3HT , indicating a strong intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer between P3HT and PCBM moieties. PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped into P3HT : PCBM blend solution with different doping ratios ( 1 , 2 and 5 wt % ) and the surface morphology of PCBM-Ph-P3HT - doped film was studied by AFM , indicating that PCBM-Ph-P3HT promotes the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT and PCBM components due to its amphiphilicity toward P3HT and PCBM like a \" surfactant \" . At the optimum PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio of 1 wt % , the P3HT : PCBM BHJ - PSC devices doped by PCBM-Ph-P3HT show an enhanced power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) , with the maximum PCE being 3.40% which has ca. 12% enhancement compared to that of the reference P3HT : PCBM device. The enhancement of PCE is evidently attributed to the increase of short - circuit current ( J sc ) , and proposed enhancement mechanism is that the improvement on the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT and PCBM components upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping leads to the increase of the charge carrier mobility . Conjugated polymers , especially polythiophenes , have been receiving much attention in the potential application in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) which show a bright prospect for inexpensive solar energy conversion.

    "sentence": "One is to integrate the donor and acceptor moieties in the same main chain via a p-linking bridge to form donor-p-acceptor double cable conjugated polymers , which help to promote the homogeneous dispersion of the donor / acceptor domains and thus the interface between donor and acceptor counterparts could be improved and even maximized. [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] Another effort has been devoted to use diblock copolymers with two different blocks of conjugated polymers and fullerene as a compatibilizer reducing the interfacial tension between donor and acceptor and consequently decreasing the phase sizes of the components. [19][20][21][22][23][24][25] The latter approach was also reported to be useful for improving the long - term thermal stability of the BHJ - PSC devices. 19,24,26 Noteworthy , for both strategies the intramolecular hybrids of donor / acceptor need to be constructed , in which fullerenes are attached to the conjugated polymers either as pendants in the side - chain or as terminal groups. [19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] For the former case a much higher substitution ratio of the fullerene moiety can be attained which appears important to tune the electronic and physical properties of the pristine conjugated polymers , hence numerous reports involve the synthesis of donor-p-acceptor double cable conjugated polymers bearing a fullerene pendant. 14,19,21,24,25,[28][29][30][31][32][33] P3HT and PCBM are the most commonly used donor and acceptor materials in BHJ - PSCs , which may however suffer from considerable phase separation due to their immiscibility. 6 To overcome such a problem , several different PCBM-P3HT intramolecular hybrids were constructed in a few reports. 8,23,24,26 Li et al. synthesized a C 60 - substituted double cable polythiophene in which C 60 was attached to the polythiophene backbone via an alkylphenylene linkage and in that way the C 60 pendant mimics the PCBM structure , affording a PCE of 0.52% which is the highest value for the BHJ - PSCs based on the double cable polymers. 34 Holdcro et al. synthesized P3HT-PCBM donoracceptor gra copolymers through cycloaddition of PCBM onto an azido substituted chloromethylstyrene-stat-styrene side chain grown on the thiophene backbone , and found that the use of PCBM improved the solubility of the fullerene - graed copolymers and minimized their aggregation in solution. 21 Wudl et al. synthesized the \" donor - acceptor rod - coil \" diblock copolymers ( P3HT-b-P(S x A y )-C 60 ) by a straightforward synthetic strategy of living polymerization and subsequent cycloaddition , which was added to the P3HT : PCBM layer resulting in about 35% increase in PCE. 25 A similar diblock copolymer of P3HT and PCBM ( P3HT-b-C 60 ) was also reported by Jo et al. exhibiting a complete quenching of photoluminescence of P3HT. 23 On the other hand , PCBM end - capped P3HT was also reported by two groups.",

    "sentence": "Jo et al. synthesized a PCBM end - capped P3HT ( P3HT-C 60 ) via a Grignard metathesis polymerization method followed by directly linking PCBM to the chain end of P3HT via a Steglich esterication , and used it as a compatibilizer for a P3HT / PCBM composite for the purpose of controlling the morphology of the P3HT / PCBM composite lm , and thus improving the long - term thermal stability of solar cell performance. 26 Alternatively , Wudl et al. synthesized a similar PCBM-P3HT dyad through a Steglich reaction of P3HT-Ph-OH with carboxylated PCBM ( [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid , PCBA ) , which serves as a compatibilizer in P3HT / PCBM BHJ - PSCs and as a \" surfactant \" to enhance the solubility of fullerenes in poor solvents. 35 Obviously , the reported synthetic methods of P3HT-PCBM donor - acceptor diblock copolymers typically require living polymerization and / or complicated design of the bridging groups , whereas PCBM end - capped P3HT was synthesized via much simpler methods involving the Steglich esterication reaction. 23,26,35 In this paper , we report the facile synthesis of a novel double cable donor - acceptor P3HT derivative ( PCBM-Ph-P3HT ) , in which the PCBM moiety as the side chain is closely linked to the thiophene unit via a phenyl group. In the rst two steps hydroxyl-functionalized P3HT is synthesized via postpolymerization following our recent success on the synthesis of a series of soluble donor-p-acceptor double cable P3HT bearing C 60 pendant with tunable donor / acceptor ratio and a pyrene - functionalized P3HT derivative , 29,30 and the last step involves a Steglich esterication reaction popularly employed in the synthesis of PCBM end - capped P3HT , which simplied signicantly the synthesis to merely three steps. The polymeric structure and electronic properties of the synthesized PCBM-Ph-P3HT have been investigated by 1H NMR , UV - Vis , and uorescence spectroscopies. The effect of PCBM-Ph-P3HT doped in the P3HT : PCBM blend solution on both the surface morphology of P3HT : PCBM lm and device performance of P3HT : PCBM BHJ - PSCs is addressed . The UV - Vis absorption spectra of P3HT , PCBA , Br-P3HT , HO-Ph-P3HT , and PCBM-Ph-P3HT in CHCl 3 solution are compared in Fig. 2. The absorption maximum ( l max ) of Br-P3HT ( 446 nm ) was only slightly blue - shied ( 4 nm ) versus that of P3HT ( 450 nm ) , indicating that a 3% bromine - substitution of the P3HT backbone does not alter the P3HT backbone structure and the p-p intermolecular interactions among P3HT chains. This result is apparently different to what we observed for Br-P3HT with much higher bromine - substitution ratios ( 12-20 % ) reported in our previous works , in which a certain extent of twisting of the P3HT backbone due to the highratio of bromine - substitution was deduced from the large blue - shis ( 13-23 nm ) of l max of Br-P3HT versus P3HT.",

    "sentence": "29,30 For HO-Ph-P3HT , l max stays almost constant compared to that of Br-P3HT ( see inset of Fig. 2 ) , again this phenomena is different to the case of HO-Ph-P3HT with higher HO - substitution ratios. 29 The UV - Vis absorption spectrum of PCBM-Ph-P3HT exhibits two broad absorption bands between 300 and 600 nm with three l max observed at 328 , 432 , and 444 nm ( Fig. 2d ). Among them , l max at 328 and 432 nm can be assigned to the absorption of the PCBM moiety according to the two characteristic absorption peaks at 331 , 431 nm observed in the absorption spectrum of PCBA which are slightly shied. In particular , the second l max at 432 nm is commonly observed in the [6,6]-closed mono-adduct of C 60 . 29 Another absorption band with l max at around 444 nm is attributed to the P3HT component on the basis of its similarity with those of Br-P3HT and HO-P3HT , and originates from the p-p* transition of the P3HT backbone. Coincidentally , this l max is partially overlapped with the second l max at 432 nm but clearly detectable as a shoulder absorption band ( see inset of Fig. 2 ). Noteworthy , l max at around 444 nm of PCBM-Ph-P3HT experiences a blue - shi of 6 nm compared to that of P3HT , and this can be interpreted by the weak perturbation of the molecular arrangement of the P3HT backbone upon the graing of the PCBM pendant. Thus , the successful addition of PCBA onto the HO-Ph-P3HT backbone is conrmed further since the absorption features of PCBM and P3HT components are both retained. It is known that the uorescence properties are useful for probing the intramolecular charge transfer dynamics between donor and acceptor specically for the donor - acceptor systems based on fullerene derivatives. 39 Fig. 3 illustrates the uorescence spectrum of PCBM-Ph-P3HT in chlorobenzene in comparison with those of P3HT and P3HT / PCBM blend , which are measured under identical spectrophotometric parameters. For the P3HT / PCBM blend , numerous reports revealed that the uorescence of P3HT can be quenched by PCBM due to intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer , and our measurement on the uorescence spectrum of P3HT : PCBM ( 1 : 0.13 ) 40 blend indicates a x 52% quenching of the uorescence of P3HT ( Fig. 3a and b ). However , for PCBM-Ph-P3HT , the uorescence intensity of P3HT is much more quenched compared to that of P3HT / PCBM blend , being x 63% quenching according to the integral of the uorescence band ( see Fig. 3c ). These results indicate that a strong intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer originating from the covalent linkage of PCBM moiety to the P3HT backbone via the phenyl bridge takes place in PCBM-Ph-P3HT upon photoexcitation. Apparently , the intramolecular hybrid structure of PCBM-Ph-P3HT enables closer contact of the PCBM moiety with the thienyl ring via the phenyl bridge , facilitating their p-p interactions.",

[21][22][23][24][25][26] For instance , Wudl et al. synthesized the \" donor - acceptor rod - coil \" diblock copolymers ( P3HT-b-P(S 8 A 2 )-C 60 ) and found that the phase domains of P3HT and PCBM increased in size upon doping 5 wt % P3HT-b-P(S 8 A 2 )-C 60 to the P3HT : PCBM blend mixture. This was explained by the migration of the P3HT-b-P(S 8 A 2 )-C 60 block copolymer as a surfactant into the interface between P3HT and PCBM , resulting in the improved miscibility of P3HT and PCBM. 25 Similarly , Jo et al. synthesized PCBM end - capped P3HT ( P3HT-C 60 ) and their TEM study revealed that P3HT-C 60 doped at the optimized ratio of 2.5 wt % reduced the domain size of the P3HT : PCBM composite lm and suppressed the macrophase separation for prolonged thermal annealing as an effective compatibilizer. 26 In a similar way PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped into a P3HT : PCBM blend solution with different doping ratios ( 1 , 2 , and 5 wt % ) and the blend lms of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT : PCBM were prepared by casting from chlorobenzene followed by slow evaporation at room temperature for 10 min. Fig. 4 which is comparable to the reported values with devices fabricated under similar conditions ( chlorobenzene as solvent ). 6,24 When PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped in the P3HT : PCBM photoactive layer with very low doping ratios of 0.5 and 1 wt % , obvious enhancements of PCE were observed from 3.13% to 3.40% , respectively. However , with the further increase of PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio to 2 wt % , the PCE of the device decreases to 3.28% ( see Table 1 ). As a result , the PCE of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT : PCBM device shows the maximum ( 3.40% ) at the optimum PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio of 1 wt % , which has ca. 12% enhancement compared to that of reference P3HT : PCBM device. A careful examination of each photovoltaic parameter is made so as to disclose the factor accounting for the enhancement of the PCE upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping. Clearly , V oc of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT : PCBM devices changes very slightly ( 0.60 - 0.63 V ) compared to that of the reference P3HT : PCBM device.",

    "sentence": "Likewise , FF experiences very subtle variation with and without PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ( see Table 1 ). Nevertheless , with the increase of the PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio to 1 wt % , J sc of the PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT : PCBM device increases dramatically from 8.93 to 9.92 mA cm^-2 ( ca. 11% enhancement ) , and the enhancement ratio is quite comparable to that of the PCE. When the doping ratio of PCBM-Ph-P3HT is further increased to 2 wt % , J sc decreases to 9.69 mA cm^-2 . Fig. 6 presents the dependence of the enhancements of J sc and PCE on the PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio , clearly indicating the maximum enhancement of J sc ( ca. 11% enhancement ) and PCE ( ca. 12% enhancement ) at the optimum PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio of 1 wt % . Hence , the enhancement of PCE is evidently attributed to the increase of J sc . Interestingly , this phenomena is quite similar to the case of P3HT-b-P(S 8 A 2 )-C 60 doping in P3HT : PCBM BHJ - PSC devices reported in ref. 25 in which an enhancement of J sc leads to an increase in PCE , and the effect of P3HT-b-P(S 8 A 2 )-C 60 is proposed to improve the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT : PCBM BHJ composite. 25 On the basis of the similarity of the effect of PCBM-Ph-P3HT on both the surface morphology of P3HT : PCBM lm and device performance of P3HT : PCBM BHJ - PSC to that of P3HT-b-P(S 8 A 2 )-C 60 , the enhancement of J sc resulting from PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping can be interpreted by a similar mechanism. Since J sc is dependent on not only the multiplication of the photoinduced charge carrier density and the charge carrier mobility within the active material but also the interface properties between the active layers and the electrodes , 10 presumably the improvement on the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT : PCBM components upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping , as revealed in the above surface morphology study , leads to the increase of the charge carrier mobility. Accordingly the decrease of J sc with higher doping ratio of PCBM-Ph-P3HT ( 2 wt % ) may be understood by the excessive phase segregation promoted by PCBM-Ph-P3HT which is unfavorable for charge carrier diffusion within the photoactive layer. 25 In summary , employing a postpolymerization approach followed by a Steglich esterication reaction , we have successfully synthesized a novel double cable donor - acceptor P3HT derivative ( PCBM-Ph-P3HT ) , in which the PCBM moiety as the side chain is closely linked to the thiophene unit via a phenyl group. The Steglich esterication reaction involved in the last step was demonstrated to have a high conversion rate and simplied signicantly the synthesis to merely three steps. The successful attachment of PCBM to the P3HT backbone is conrmed by both 1H NMR and UV - Vis spectroscopic studies , and the absorption features of PCBM and P3HT components are both retained in PCBM-Ph-P3HT.",

    "sentence": "2f,4a The electron mobility of PCBM is around 2 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , 5 whereas the hole mobility of conjugated polymer donors is usually several orders lower than the electron mobility of PCBM. In order to increase the hole mobility of polymer donors , polymer chains are required to have a planar structure and closely pack in films. 6 Main chain donor - acceptor ( D-A ) alternating design is a very efficient way to tune the absorption and energy level of conjugated polymers through the intramolecular charge transfer from donor to acceptor unit. 3g,7 On the one hand , benzothiadiazole is a commonly used acceptor unit in construction of D-A alternating conjugated polymers , and high power conversion efficiency has been achieved for benzothiadiazole containing D-A alternating copolymers. 8 On the other hand , 2,7-linked fluorene ( two benzene ring bridged by carbon atom ) , 7e,8a,9 2,7-linked carbazole ( two benzene rings bridged by nitrogen atom ) , 2e,10 and 2,7-linked silafluorene ( two benzene rings bridged by silicon atom ) 6c,11 have been used as donor units for the construction of the D-A copolymers. However , until now there is no report on using 3,7-linked dibenzothiophene ( two benzene rings bridged by sulfur atom ) as donor unit in synthesizing D-A alternating copolymers. It is worthy noting that Wang et al. have found that marked chalcogen - chalcogen interactions exist in chalcogen - annulated perylene solid films , which may facilitate charge transport. 12 In this work , we design and synthesize three D-A alternating copolymers with 3,7-linked 2,8-bis(alkoxy)dibenzothiophene as the donor unit and benzothiadiazole or 3,4-bis(octyloxy)benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit. We attached two alkoxy substituents on the 2,8-positions of dibenzothiophene to ensure that the two alkoxy chains do not hinder the π-π stacking of polymer backbones in solid films and generates soluble polymers.. For the first time , we demonstrate that 2,8-bis(alkoxy) - substituted dibenzothiophene can be a useful donor unit for constructing main chain D-A alternating narrow band gap conjugated polymer for high efficiency polymer solar cells. In addition , we have found that conjugated polymers ( P3 ) with 2,8-bis(alkoxy)dibenzothiophene as the donor unit and 5,6-bis(octyloxy)substituted benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit show a strong internal charge transfer ( ICT ) absorption in the long wavelength region , whereas copolymers ( P1 and P2 ) with 2,8-bis(alkoxy)dibenzothiophene as the donor unit and benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit show a relative weak ICT absorption. As expected , the strong absorbed P3 - based polymer solar cells show higher PCE than the weak absorbed P1 - and P2 - based polymer solar cell devices.",

All the three polymers show broad absorption in the visible region with two peaks located at 400 and 530 nm , respectively , and P3 exhibits much stronger ICT absorption than P1 and P2. The photovoltaic performance of P3 - based polymer solar cell devices is much better than that of P1 - and P2 - based devices.

In addition , the PBDTT - TTFQ neat film reveals a highly dense fibrillar nanostructure with a certain degree of long - range order , suggesting the nanoscale self - assembly of PBDTT and TTFQ segments.

The results unambiguously indicate that the PBDTT - TTFQ is an auspicious candidate for next - generation solar cell materials . In recent years , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have drawn considerable promise as renewable energy sources owing to their advantages in low - cost , lightweight , and good - exibility for sustainable solar energy conversion. 1,2 Nowadays , the most efficient architecture of PSCs is a bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure with a three - dimensional interpenetrating network of conjugated polymers blended with soluble fullerene derivatives [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] or nanocrystals.

    "sentence": "Benzo [ 1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]-dithiophene ( BDT ) , as one of the most successful electron donor units , has emerged as an attractive building block for PSCs due to its rigidity , coplanarity by fusing a benzene with two anking thiophene units , high hole mobility , extended p - conjugated structures , and proper side chain patterns for enhanced solubility. 26,27 Very recently , via replacing the alkoxy-substitutes attached to the BDT - based D-A copolymer with alkylthienyl groups , Hou et al. 5 were capable of constructing a two - dimensional ( 2-D ) conjugated BDT - polymer possessing a broader absorption band , a lower highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , a higher hole mobility , as well as a better photovoltaic efficiency than that of the alkoxysubstituted analogues. In a relevant contribution , we reported a new alternating copolymer PBDT - TFQ containing an alkoxysubstituted-BDT moiety , and a uorinated quinoxaline ( TFQ ) unit as the D and the A , respectively , which was then applied in organic photovoltaic devices ( OPVs ) with power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) up to 8% . 3 This result indicates that TFQ is one of the efficacious acceptor units for organic semiconductors because of its strong electron affinity that offers deep HOMO energy levels and a broad absorption range , which are important parameters for p - type semiconducting polymers. 3 However , one of the main bottlenecks for the PBDT - TFQ is its relatively short absorption coverage at the near - infrared ( NIR ) region due to the fact that the TFQ moiety possesses a high content of benzene rings. The high aromaticity and hence the great stabilization energy of phenyl substitution leads to a relatively larger optical bandgap that limits light - harvesting. This drawback may be crucial , which motivated us to further replace the phenyl substitutions of the TFQ core with thienyl substitutions in an aim to achieve better sunlight harvesting. This is simply due to the fact that sulfur is a soer atom ( cf. the carbon atom ) so that thienyl substitution is expected to enhance the p-conjugation. In this context , we report herein a facile and straightforward synthetic methodology to prepare a novel semi-crystalline uorinated thienyl-quinoxaline - based D-A alternating copolymer with thiophene p - bridge units , namely , poly{4,8-bis(5 -(2-ethyl- hexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt- [ 5,8-bis(5 0 -thiophen-2 0 -yl)-6,7 -diuoro-2,3-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2yl)quinoxaline-5,5 0 -diyl ] } ( PBDTT - TTFQ , see Scheme 1 ) , by Stille coupling polymerization reactions , which turns out to be a very promising candidate for efficient PSCs. This low bandgap polymer , designed based on the intrachain D-A copolymer motif , was capable of extending the absorption into the red and NIR region with the desired deep HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels , and also exhibited a higher hole mobility.",

    "sentence": "As a result , the PSC fabricated under a blend ratio of 1 : 1 PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM attained an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.75 V , a short - circuit current density ( J sc ) exceeding 14 mA cm^-2 , a PCE of as high as 6.1% , demonstrating that the uorinated thienyl-quinoxaline segment is a promising building block for the development of semiconducting polymers with high photovoltaic efficiency . On the basis of the D-A concept , the medium electron - donating BDTT moiety and strong electron - accepting TTFQ unit were utilized to synthesize the low bandgap PBDTT - TTFQ copolymer. The brief synthetic routes of monomers and the corresponding polymer are illustrated in Scheme 1. PBDTT - TTFQ was synthesized in good yield through a Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as a catalyst via thermal heating shown in the ESI. † The crude polymer was precipitated into methanol and ltered , followed by careful extraction with methanol , acetone , dichloromethane and chloroform with Soxhlet apparatus to remove byproducts and oligomers. The nal product was obtained from the chloroform fraction precipitated into methanol , ltered and dried under vacuum for 12 h. PBDTT - TTFQ exhibits an excellent lm - casting property as well as good solubility in common halogenated solvents. The numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) of the synthesized copolymer PBDTT - TTFQ was determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using a polystyrene standard in THF eluent , and was found to be 43 kg mol^-1 with a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 1.58. The thermal stability of the copolymer was conrmed by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) at a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C min -1 under nitrogen atmosphere. The onset decomposition temperature of PBDTT - TTFQ at 5% weight loss is 405 °C , indicating high thermal stability of the as-prepared polymer ( see Fig. 1a ). Through differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) measurements , PBDTT - TTFQ copolymer shows a high glasstransition temperature ( T g ) of 126 °C probably because of the high chain rigidity of the polymer backbone. The optical absorption spectra of PBDTT - TTFQ acquired in 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) solution and as a lm are shown in Fig. 1b. PBDTT - TTFQ in dilute DCB solution exhibits a broad and strong absorption spectral feature across the entire UV - vis region , with three major absorption bands and hence peak wavelengths located at 359 , 421 and 563 nm. The two higher energy bands originate from the localized p-p* transitions , whereas the lowest lying band is attributed to the ICT from the PBDTT unit to the TTFQ core. In the polymer lm , the corresponding absorption becomes broader and is signicantly red - shied as compared with the corresponding maxima of the polymer solution with four peaks at 361 , 441 , 593 and 645 nm.",

    "sentence": "The large red - shi of 30 nm is observed in the absorption maxima ( l max ) relative to the dilute solution as a result of a more planar polymer chain structure and / or the degree of interchain p-stacking in the solid lm. Such an ordered packing of polymer chains is benecial for improving the charge carrier mobility of the resulting lms. Furthermore , the absorption edge ( l edge ) of PBDTT - TTFQ lm is 742 nm , from which the lowest - lying energy gap E opt g of PBDTT - TTFQ , deduced from the onset of absorption in the solid state , is determined to be 1.67 eV. Detailed optical and electrochemical properties of PBDTT - TTFQ are summarized in Table 1. Experimentally , cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to examine the electrochemical properties and determine the HOMO and LUMO energies of the as-prepared copolymer ( see Fig. S14 † ). The PBDTT - TTFQ copolymer showed stable and quasi-reversible p - doping and n - doping processes , which are important prerequisites for p - type semiconductor materials. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PBDTT - TTFQ were found to be -5.34 and -3.26 eV , respectively. A slightly higher energy bandgap was determined using CV ( 2.08 eV ) than that from UV - vis absorption measurements ( 1.67 eV ). The discrepancy , on the one hand , is probably because of an energy barrier between the polymer lm and electrode used in the CV measurement. On the other hand , however , the different binding energy of excitons created in the optical and electrochemical measurement can not be eliminated. A deeply lowlying HOMO energy level was obtained for PBDTT - TTFQ , which is in an ideal range to ensure better air - stability and can be anticipated to approach high V oc , in accordance with the linear correlation of the difference between the HOMO energy level of a donor polymer and the LUMO energy level of an acceptor. 28 Considering the LUMO level of PC71BM is located at -4.0 eV , the offset between donor polymer and acceptor PC71BM should provide a sufficient driving force for efficient exciton dissociation at the D-A interface , ensuring energetically favorable electron transfer. 1,2 To provide an in-depth insight into the molecular architecture of the polymer , a molecular simulation was carried out using density functional theory ( DFT ) at the B3LYP / 6-31G* level with the Gaussian 09 package in an aim to estimate the optimized geometries and the corresponding charge - density isosurfaces properties. The resulting frontier molecular orbitals depicted in Fig. 2 predict that the electron density of the HOMO is mainly localized at the PBDTT and in part at the benzene site of TTFQ , while the electron density of the LUMO is dominantly localized on the entire TTFQ moiety. The analysis provides sufficient evidence of the formation of a D-p-A structure and the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) behavior of the material.",

    "sentence": "Photovoltaic properties of the PBDTT - TTFQ copolymer were investigated in solar cells with a device conguration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al. The asymmetric PC71BM was used due to its stronger light absorption in the visible region than that of PC61BM. Fig. 3a depicts the current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves of the BHJ solar devices with various blend ratios of PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM measured under simulated one - sun AM1.5G illumination. It was noticed that the V oc of PBDTT - TTFQ - based devices dropped from 0.75 to 0.72 V with increasing PC71BM content in the blends , and the device with a D-A ratio of 1 : 1 showed the highest J sc in these two conditions. As reported , the device fabrication process of a PSC can be further improved by thermal annealing and / or by using 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) as an additive owing to its high boiling point ( 168 °C ) and ability to solvate the fullerenes during the spin - coating process. 29,30 In this work , both of these two methods ( 150 °C for 10 min , 3 vol % DIO ) were employed to optimize the device performance. The device based on the PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 in wt % ) blends revealed a V oc of 0.75 V , a J sc of 14.6 mA cm^-2 , a FF of 56.1% , delivering an exceptional PCE of 6.1% . Indeed , the high V oc is attributed to the lower - lying HOMO energy level of PBDTT - TTFQ as a result of the uorine electron - withdrawing effect on the TTFQ unit , and the result is in complete accord with previous reports. 3,4,7,31 The introduction of uorine substituents on D-A conjugated polymers has a minor effect on their optical properties but affects signicantly their energy levels owing to its strong electronegativity. This has led to the decrease of both HOMO and LUMO energy levels , rendering higher V oc values. The superior PSC performance of the 1 : 1 blends is associated with the high hole mobility and better nanoscale morphology of the interpenetrating network ( vide infra ) , allowing efficient exciton dissociation and enhancing charge carrier transportation. [32][33][34][35][36] However , further increasing the blend ratio to 1 : 2 signicantly deteriorates all photovoltaic parameters ( V oc , J sc , and FF ) and results in a lower PSC efficiency ( see Fig. 3a and Table 2 ). To verify the accuracy of the photo J-V measurements , the corresponding incident photon - to - current efficiency ( IPCE ) spectra of the devices elaborated above were measured under illumination of monochromatic light shown in Fig. 3b. According to the PSC devices fabricated with various PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM blend ratios , very broad panchromatic spectra over the entire excitation spectral range were obtained from IPCE measurements.",

    "sentence": "The optimum device very efficiently harvests solar light with the maximum IPCE of 72% at 420 nm , and exhibits a broad photoresponse of over 60% in the 343-612 nm range. Moreover , the IPCE spectra accord well with the absorption spectra of the blends ( Fig. S15 † ) , resulting in a close correlation with the photocurrents. The integral J sc of both devices with blend ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 from IPCE curves are 13.4 and 11.7 mA cm^-2 , respectively. The J sc values calculated from integration of the IPCE spectra are within 5-10 % , which conform well to those obtained from the J-V measurements , supporting the reliability of the photovoltaic measurement. Regardless of the blend ratios , the data for these devices highlight an important fact in that IPCE exceeds 50% for more than half of the visible region. Besides the absorption and energy levels , charge - carrier mobility is another crucial factor for achieving high - efficiency devices. Both hole - and electron - mobility were calculated using the space - charge - limited current ( SCLC ) model at low voltage. 37,38 The device characteristics were extracted by modeling the dark current under forward bias , described by the Mott - Gurney law. We found about threefold enhancement in hole mobility of the 1 : 1 PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM devices compared to the 1 : 2 PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM devices , with mobility increasing from 2.2 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 to 6.5 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( see Fig. 4 ). Moreover , the 1 : 1 device shows a wellbalanced mobility ( m e / m h = 1.5 ) as compared to that of the 1 : 2 device ( m e / m h = 4.0 ). The balanced mobility contributes , in part , to the higher J sc and FF observed in the optimized BHJ devices because the accumulated SCLC charges and hence recombination processes are reduced by the increased hole mobility and enhanced charge collection efficiency. 35,36 The nano-scale morphology plays an important role in the device performance. Proper morphology is necessary not only for exciton dissociation but also for charge transport to respective electrodes for efficient collection. [32][33][34][35][36] Therefore , the morphological structures of PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM blend lms with various compositions were probed by tapping mode atom force microscopy ( TM - AFM ) measurements. In Fig. 5a and d , the pristine lm reveals a highly dense brillar nanostructure with a certain degree of long - range order , suggesting the nanoscale self - assembly of PBDTT and TTFQ segments ( vide infra ). The distinct spacing of the nanostructures has a lateral dimension ranging from 18 to 22 nm , which is approximately in the same magnitude as the exciton diffusion length , and may effectively assist charge transport prior to recombination.",

The net result is to destroy the continuous percolating pathway for hole and electron transport to the corresponding electrodes , thereby increasing the rate of recombination of charge carriers and reducing the V oc , 32,36 accounting for the lower PCE ( vide supra ). Moreover , the rough surface will also induce high surface resistance , which is destructive to the performance of solar cells. These results suggest that , 1 : 1 blends may provide an adequate combination of polymer solubility and miscibility with PC71BM to achieve optimal lm morphology. The nanoscale phase separation of PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM blend lms was also examined by TEM experiments. As shown in Fig. S16 , † the bright PBDTT - TTFQ - rich domains tend to form a highly dense brillar nanostructure , whereas the dark PC71BM - rich domains are well distributed in the polymer matrix. The PBDTT - TTFQ nanobers with 13-20 nm in width are observed in the TEM images. These nanobers form an interpenetrated network surrounded by the PC71BM phase , the combination of which develops a bicontinuous nanoscale morphology that enlarges the contact area between the PBDTT - TTFQ nanobers and the PC71BM clusters for efficient charge separation and transport. These TEM images of blend lms are identical to those of TM - AFM observations shown in the Fig. 5. To gain deeper insight into the molecular packing and nanostructural order within the active layer , synchrotron grazing incidence wide - angle X-ray scattering ( GIWAXS ) analysis was performed to examine the neat polymer lm and the optimized 1 : 1 PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM BHJ blend lm. In Fig. 6a , the 2D GIWAXS pattern of the neat PBDTT - TTFQ lm shows arc and anisotropic ring scattering patterns. The Bragg scattering peak of ( 100 ) appears relatively strong in intensity at q = 0.302Å -1 with an interlayer d 100 spacing of 20.80Å , corresponding to the periodic lamellae of polymer backbones , and the weak diffraction peak at q x 0.64Å -1 represents the second - order ( 200 ) reection of lamellae ( d 200 spacing x 9.83Å ). Moreover , the stronger intensity of the ( 100 ) reection in the out - of - plane scattering prole than in the in-plane scattering prole indicated that the lamellar packing PBDTT - TTFQ preferentially stacked out of the lm plane ( edge-on rich orientation ) , though with some randomness.",

    "sentence": "The results may be attributed to the introduction of branched alkyl side - chains in PBDTT - TTFQ resulting in the misorientation of the polymer lamellae. 39 In addition , PBDTT - TTFQ homopolymer exhibited a distinctive arc scattering along the q z axis at q = 1.75Å -1 , corresponding to the face - to - face ( 010 ) p-p stacking packing reection peak of the polymer backbones. We also notice that the ( 010 ) peak is prominent in the out - ofplane orientation , which implies a large portion of p-p stacking is perpendicular to the substrate. This arrangement is benecial for charge transport in the device and has oen correlated with high OPV performance. 5,[23][24][25] Additionally , the result coincides with the TM - AFM image of the neat PBDTT - TTFQ ( Fig. 5a ) that clearly reveals a crystalline brillar interpenetrating network , possibly owing to the strong intermolecular p-p interactions. 11,40 It is noteworthy that the arc and anisotropic ring scatterings became sharper and more intense than those of the as-cast lm ( Fig. S17 † ) upon thermal annealing , suggesting that structures of the lm became more ordered and preferentially oriented aer thermal annealing. Interestingly , the same diffraction peaks of the pristine polymer were still visible in the 2D patterns of the blend lm shown in Fig. 6b. The lamellar packing is visible in the blends , indicating that the PBDTT - TTFQ is able to retain the same edge-on arrangement of the molecules when blended with fullerene. The broad ring is corresponding to the presence of nanoscale PC71BM domains interspersed in the blended phase ( Fig. 6b ) , indicating random orientation with respect to the lm substrate. Moreover , in assessing the effect of these p-p interactions on solar cell performance , it is important to consider p-stacking distance. Compared with panels c , d of Fig. 6 , the p-p stacking distance in the blend lm ( d 010 spacing = 3.26Å ) is signicantly smaller than that in the neat lm ( d 010 spacing = 3.49Å ). A shorter distance is thought to reduce the energetic barrier for charge hopping between adjacent molecules , which can enhance the out - of - plane charge transport and light absorption , resulting in the increase of device performance. 41,42 An additional intense ( 300 ) reection peak can be clearly observed , indicating that lamellar stacking of the blend lm has further been improved ( see Fig. 6b and d ). The result may arise from the strong polymer - fullerene interactions that delay the fullerene self - assembly in the nal drying process. Therefore , fullerene aggregation during lm formation may promote the self - organization of the polymer. 43,44 By extracting from the out - of - plane GIWAXS prole , the 1-D intensity proles of ( 100 ) reection peak associated with the backbone lamellae of the neat PBDTT - TTFQ , and the PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM blend lm are plotted in Fig. 7.",

The smaller FWHM of the scattering patterns corresponds to a larger crystal dimension in the polymer as a result of mixing with PC71BM , indicating that fullerene could induce polymer self - assembly towards the kinetics equilibration of the blends ' phase separation. 11,45 In conclusion , a novel PBDTT - TTFQ D-A copolymer with thiophene p - bridge units has been successfully synthesized and characterized. Not only did the resulting copolymer reveal a very broad and intense absorption prole , but it also preserved many attractive properties of the desired deep HOMO and LUMO energy levels , semicrystallinity , high hole mobility , and optimal blending with fullerenes at favorable ratios , allowing high V oc and J sc values. PSCs prepared from 1 : 1 PBDTT-TTFQ:PC71BM blends exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 6.1% with a short - circuit current density of 14.6 mA cm^-2 , an open - circuit voltage of 0.75 V , and a ll factor of 56.1% under AM 1.5G illumination , which reveals a promising candidate for next - generation solar cell materials. The results also indicate that the TTFQ unit is an ideal building block to develop high - performance polymer solar cells.

The π-bridge between the C donor unit and the QP acceptor unit is thiophene ( T ) in P(C-T-QP) , bithiophene ( BT ) in P(C-BT-QP) , and terthiophene ( TT ) in P(C-TT-QP) or P(C-TT-QP-Zn ). These copolymers possess good solubility , high thermal stability , broad absorption , and low bandgap ranging from 1.66 to 1.73 eV. The influence of the π-bridge and the central Zn ion on the electronic and photovoltaic properties was investigated and discussed in detail. It was found that the π-bridge played an important role in tuning the effective conjugation length and therefore significantly affected the molecular architecture and optoelectronic properties of the copolymers. With the π-bridge varying from thiophene to bithiophene , then to terthiophene , the hole mobility of the copolymers increased gradually , and the absorption was broadened in turn. Zn ion in the porphyrin ring also had a significant influence on the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties. Bulk heterojunction solar cells with the polymers as donor and PC71BM as acceptor demonstrated PCEs of 0.97% for P(C-T-QP) , 1.97% for P(C-BT-QP) , 2.53% for P(C-TT-QP) , and 1.45% for P(C-TT-QP-Zn ). All of them are among the highest PCE values of PSCs based on porphyrin polymers. Among the four polymers , although the P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows the highest hole mobility and the widest absorption , the corresponding PSC demonstrated the lowest PCE because the morphology of P(C-TT-QP-Zn) / PC71BM blend film is not beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport. This study provides a new insight toward the design and future development of quinoxalinoporphyrin - based conjugated polymers . Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) which are based on solution - processable conjugated polymer donor and fullerene derivative acceptor materials have been widely studied due to their low - cost solution fabrication process , lightweight , and device mechanical flexibility as well as potential contribution to clean and renewable energy. To achieve highperformance PSCs , the electron - donating conjugated polymers need to have appropriate band gaps to maximize solar radiation capture , good hole mobility , and reasonable highest occupied molecular orbital levels ( HOMO ) to maximize the short circuit current ( J sc ) and open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , respectively. 1-11 At present , conjugated polymers with electron donor - acceptor ( D-A ) architecture are particularly attractive due to the facile tunability of their electronic structure of the main chain by controlling the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) from the donor units to the acceptor units. 12,13 Porphyrins and their derivatives have been intensively studied over many years due to their importance in the photochemistry and biochemical processes.",

    "sentence": "Porphyrins are preferable photosensitizers for utilizing solar energy for the reason that they play an important role in the photosynthesis of plants. Their large π-conjugation systems as well as their good thermal stabilities also make porphyrins to be promising materials for organic photonic and electronic applications. 14 Up to now , porphyrin - based small molecules BHJ solar cells and dye - sensitized solar cells ( DSSCs ) have reached power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of more than 5% and 12% , respectively. 15,16 However , when applying porphyrin polymers in solar cells , poor PCEs were obtained ( less than 1% ). 17-23 The relatively narrow absorption spectrum and less efficient conjugation in the main chain are the critical factors that limit the improvement of photoelectric properties. The typical absorption spectra of porphyrin units exhibit a sharp and strong Soret band ( 410-430 nm ) and weak Q-bands ( 530- 540 nm ) without absorption between them , and the conventional meso-aryl linkage in porphyrin polymers can not broaden the absorption effectively by intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) due to the large aryl-porphyrin dihedral angles. 23-25 However , quinoxalino[2 , 3-b′]porphyrins are more π-expanded systems and were proposed as \" molecular wires \" . 26 By incorporation of different central metal ions or selective functionalization at β-pyrrolic positions , it enable \" fine - tuning \" of electronic properties of compounds by altering relative energy levels of the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ). But , the studies about quinoxalinoporphyrin are still at the level of small molecules or large multiporphyrin arrays , and it has not yet been used in polymers. 27 Recently , we designed and reported a new D-π-A copolymer P(C-TT-QP) with quinoxalinoporphyrin as acceptor unit , 2,7-carbazole as donor unit , and terthiophene as a π-bridge. P(C-TT-QP) exhibited an unusually broadened and enhanced Q-band absorbance compared to other porphyrin - based conjugated polymers reported in the literature. More interestingly , the absorption blank between the Soret band and Q-bands has been covered perfectly for the first time. As a result , PCE of solar cell based on P(C-TT-QP) reached 2.5% . 28 These results indicate that the photovoltaic performance of the porphyrinbased conjugated polymers could be greatly improved by using quinoxalinoporphyrin. However , to achieve higher efficiency porphyrin polymers , it is needed to further study the effect of the molecular structure on the optical , electrochemical , and photovoltaic properties. 29 Herein , two novel quinoxalinoporphyrin - based copolymers P(C-T-QP) and P(C-BT-QP) were synthesized. Combining with our previously reported P(C-TT-QP) , the three copolymers were used to systematically study the effects of the bridges on absorption , energy levels , and charge transport properties of the copolymers. On the other hand , it is noted that nearly in all the literatures reported for the porphyrin - based photovoltaic polymers so far , zinc(II) porphyrins rather than free - base porphyrins were chosen as building blocks without discussion on their difference in photovoltaic properties.",

    "sentence": "But Wong et al. reported that by blending free - base porphyrin additives in the 9,9-dioctylfluorenyl hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene ( FHBC ) moiety , the performance of BHJ devices functioned better than the zinc(II) porphyrin additives. 30 Thus , it is of prime importance to fully understand the effect of the central Zn ion on the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties in the design of new porphyrin polymers for efficient PSCs. Herein , P(C-TT-QP-Zn) with Zn ion in the porphyrin ring of P(C-TT-QP) was also synthesized to comparably study the effects of the central metal ion with P(C-TT-QP ). We found that conjugated bridges and central Zn ion in porphyrin ring crucially influence the electronic structure of polymer main chain and the interaction between donor and acceptor units and therefore remarkably affect coplanarity and optical , electrochemical , charge transport , and photovoltaic properties of the D-π-A conjugated copolymers. Synthesis and Thermal Stability. The synthesis routes of monomers and corresponding polymers are outlined in Scheme 1. Monomer QP was reacted with zinc acetate to give compound QP-Zn in a good yield. All polymers were synthesized by palladium - catalyzed Stille - coupling polymerization and purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction with methanol , hexanes , and CHCl 3 . The CHCl 3 fraction was then reduced in volume , precipitated into methanol , and collected by filtration , yielding black or dark blue solids. P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) can be readily dissolved in common solvents , such as chloroform , toluene , tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) , and chlorobenzene , and processed to form smooth and pinhole - free films upon spin - coating. P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows slight poor solubility but also can be dissolved in hot solvents. The molecular weight of the polymer was determined by GPC in THF solution relative to polystyrene standards , and the detailed GPC data are listed in Table 1. The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C / min , as shown in Figure 1. All polymers have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss at 426-456 ° C and P(C-TT-QP-Zn) processes the highest. Obviously , the thermal stability of these polymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices. Optical Properties. The absorption spectra of all studied polymers were measured in both dilute chloroform and the thin films ( Figure 2a- d ) , and the correlated optical parameters are summarized in Table 2 , including the absorption peak wavelengths ( λ abs ) , the absorption edge wavelengths ( λ onset ) , and the optical band gap ( E g opt ). For the convenience of study , we also measured the absorption spectrum of monomers TPP , QP , and QP-Zn as references. It is noted that when edge - fusing porphyrin with quinoxaline , the Soret bands of QP and QP-Zn are significantly broadened due to the extension π-conjugation ( see Figure 2a,c ).",

    "sentence": "All the polymers show absorptions in the regions of Soret band and Q-bands. Compared to the reference QP and QP-Zn absorption , the Soret band and Q-bands of the polymers are both broadened while the Q-bands enhance observably. The blank between the Soret and Q-bands is filled completely. And the absorption areas between the Soret and Qbands increase gradually with the oligothiophene bridges varying from thiophene to bithiophene and then to terthiophene due to more extended π-conjugation resulting in a more effective ICT effect. The results demonstrate that the effective ICT effect along the main chain of polymers is the key factor to broaden and enhance Q-band absorbance and fill blank absorption. The absorption spectra of the four polymers in the solid state are all broadened compared to their corresponding solution spectra. However , only slight red - shifts ( ca. 1-5 nm ) of their absorption maxima are obtained , which is probably due to the bulky 4-tert-butylphenyl substituents on the porphyrins that prevent aggregation in the solid state. 30 In Figure 2a,b , it is clear that the absorption spectra of P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) vary with the number of the conjugated thiophene rings. A comparison of the polymers reveals that P(C-TT-QP) exhibits the most bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum at 438 nm in the chloroform solution , whereas P(C-T-QP) exhibited the most hypsochromic shift absorption maximum at 427 nm. The absorption edges for solid films of P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) increase from 679 , 736 , to 742 nm , corresponding to optical band gaps ( E g opt ) decreasing from 1.83 , 1.68 , to 1.67 eV , respectively. The decreasing in E g opt from P(C-T-QP) to P(C-BT-QP) and to P(C-TT-QP) can attribute to the presence of a more extended and delocalized π-electron system ( in both solutions and solid films ) which extends the conjugation lengths of the copolymers and reduces the band gap. Also , increasing in the length of the oligothiophene bridges is beneficial to decrease steric hindrance between QP and its neighboring units. In Figure 2c,d , although the absorption maxima of P(C-TT-QP) and QP slightly red - shift more than P(C-TT-QP-Zn) and QP-Zn both in solution and in solid film , P(C-TT-QP-Zn) and QP-Zn possess more bathochromic Q-bands , and the absorption edges of P(C-TT-QP-Zn) red - shift ca. 7 nm compared to P(C-TT-QP ). It can be noticed that there are individually identifiable two components of the Soret band in QP-Zn with one of these moving to lower energy compared to the free - base analogue , and it is clear that the lower - energy Soret component shows low intensity. This feature is retained in the spectrum of P(C-TT-QP-Zn) with a shoulder at ca. 500 nm. The reason for this phenomenon is somewhat complicated , and further study is ongoing. But at least we can infer that QP-Zn shows more extended π-conjugation than the free - base analogue.",

    "sentence": "The normalized photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of the polymers in CHCl 3 solution ( at concentration of 1 mg / 100 mL ) are shown in Figure 3. The solution PL spectra of all polymers reveal both emission from donor segment ( 450-600 nm ) and from the porphyrin moiety ( 650-800 nm ) , which is indicative of incomplete energy transfer from the polymer backbone to QP or QP-Zn unit. Also , it is clear that the PL intensity of P(C-TT-QP-Zn) is lower than those of other three polymers which means weaker energy transfer when incorporate Zn ion in QP. The emission peak wavelengths λ emi of P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) are consistent with the trend of λ abs in their corresponding absorption spectra. P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows the largest bathochromic - shifted spectrum with maximum emission at 755 nm compared to P(C-TT-QP) , which is corresponding to the red - shifted Soret band. Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) has been employed and considered as an effective tool in investigating electrochemical properties of conjugated oligomers and polymers. 31 From the value of onset oxidation potential ( E ox ) and E g opt of the polymers , the HOMO and the LUMO were calculated and are listed in Table 2. The moderate onset oxidation potentials of P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) are deter - mined to be 0.68 , 0.65 , and 0.62 V vs Ag / Ag + , respectively , corresponding with the HOMO levels to be -5.39 , -5.36 , and -5.33 eV. It was worthwhile to note that the HOMO energy levels of the three polymers increase with the increasing conjugation length. The copolymers possess comparable LUMO levels between -3.66 and -3.68 eV , demonstrating that the LUMO levels of the QP - based polymers are mainly dominated by the QP unit. 31b Compared to P(C-TT-QP) , P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows higher HOMO / LUMO energy levels , which can be attributed to the increased electron density , and it can be inferred that the electron - accepting ability of QP-Zn is weaker than QP. 30 Since the open circuit voltage V oc of BHJ PSCs is correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the fullerene and HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , therefore a reasonable V oc for QP or QP-Zn - based PSCs is anticipated due to the low - lying HOMO energy level. On the other hand , the LUMO energy levels of these polymers are located at reasonable positions from -3.66 to -3.68 eV which offer enough driving force for charge separation and transfer without too much energy loss. 13 Theoretical Calculations. To provide further insight into the fundamentals of molecular architecture , molecular simulation was carried out for P(C-TT-QP) and P(C-TT-QP-Zn ). The molecular geometries of the two polymers were optimized in a trans conformation , with a chain length of n = 1 at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d,p) level with the GAMESS program package.",

    "sentence": "33 The alkyl chain of carbazole was replaced by methyl group , and 4-tert-butylphenyl at 10 and 15 positions of QP or QP-Zn was replaced by phenyl group in the calculation to avoid excessive computation demand. To better study the effects of substituents on the structure of the main chain , 4-tertbutylphenyl at 5 and 20 positions was retained ( as shown in Figure 5 ). The wave functions of the frontier molecular orbital are depicted in Figure 6. As can be observed , the HOMO is delocalized along the whole π-conjugated backbone while the LUMO is mostly concentrated on the quinoxalinoporphyrinbased acceptor groups. These images provide further evidence of the formation of well - defined D-π-A structure and the ICT behavior of the material ( i.e. , the HOMO to LUMO transition is a donor to acceptor intramolecular charge transfer ). 34 The optimized geometries are shown in Figure 7 , and relevant dihedral angles are listed in Table 3. All the dihedral angles are relatively small which is benefical to form a better planar conjugated polymer backbone. Also , we can notice that terthiophene and bithiophene are more helpful to decrease the steric hindrance from the 4-tert-butylphenyls of meso positions , and this can partly explain the lower molecule weight of P(C-T-QP) relative to that of P(C-BT-QP) and P(C-TT-QP ). The difference of the dihedral angles between P(C-TT-QP) and P(C-TT-QP-Zn) is slight , which demonstrates the complexing of zinc has not a remarkable influence on the architecture of the polymers. Photovoltaic Properties. To investigate the effects of πconjugated bridges and zinc on the photovoltaic properties of the copolymers , BHJ PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated. Figure 8 shows the current density - potential characteristic of PSCs based on the blends of polymer : PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2. To further study the performance of the PSCs devices , the hole mobilities in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method using devices with structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au.",

Figure 9 displays ln(JL 3 / V 2 ) versus ( V / L ) 0.5 curve for the measurement of the hole mobility of the copolymers by the SCLC method. As summarized in Table 4 , the hole mobilities of the polymers calculated using eq 3 are 3.1 × 10^-6 , 9.6 × 10^-6 , 3.3 × 10^-5 , and 1.3 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , P(C-TT- QP ) , and P(C-TT-QP-Zn) , respectively. It can be noticed that P(C-T-QP) and P(C-BT-QP) show lower hole mobilities than P(C-TT-QP ). This variation in device behavior can be attributed to the change of the coplanarity in the polymer backbone by the introduction of various oligothiophene bridges , and we can conclude that the change of the π-bridge from thiophene to bithiophene , and then to terthiophene , results in gradully increase of the intrachain mobility because of more extended π-conjugation and less steric hindrance. P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows the highest hole mobility of the order of 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , indicating that the incorporation of zinc may be in favor of enhancing the packing structure in the blends. The V oc , J sc , fill factor ( FF ) , PCE , and hole mobility of the PSCs are summarized in Table 4. An obvious increase in the J sc and PCE can be observed from P(C-T-QP) to P(C-TT-QP) ( i.e. , P(C-T-QP) < P(C-BT-QP) < P(C-TT-QP) ). The J sc of the polymers increased from 4.15 , 6.80 , to 8.32 mA / cm^2 , which is consistent with the lowered band gaps ( from 1.73 , 1.68 , to 1.67 eV ). The optimum photovoltaic performance with the maximum PCE value of 2.53% ( V oc = 0.68 V , J sc = 8.32 mA / cm^2 , FF = 0.45 ) was obtained in the PSC device having a weight ratio of P(C-TT-QP):PC71BM = 1 : 3.",

    "sentence": "When complexing zinc in the center , P(C-TT-QP-Zn) shows lower FF(0.36) and J sc ( 5.79 ) compared to P(C-TT-QP) and a PCE of 1.45% is obtained. Figure 10 shows the external quantum efficiencies ( EQE ) curves of the devices incorporating the polymer : PC71BM blends. It is apparent that all devices exhibited a broad response range , covering from 300 to 750 nm with maximum EQE values of 37% at ∼ 465 nm , 48% at ∼ 475 nm , and 51% at ∼ 460 nm for the PSCs based on P(C-T-QP) , P(C-BT-QP) , and P(C-TT-QP) , respectively. Compared to the absorption spectra of pristine polymers , the significantly broadened EQE responses in the visible region can be attributed to both the intrinsic absorptions of the polymers and PC71BM. P(C-TT-QP) - based device improved the EQE upon that of P(C-T-QP) and P(C-BT-QP) markedly , especially in the range of 400-500 nm. It is remarkable to see that the light - harvesting ability of P(C-TT-QP) ( with its commensurately high charge mobilities and favorable light absorption characterisitics ) can be increased by introducing terthiophene in the main chain. This is in agreement with increased maximum absorption with increasing m from M 1 to M 3 , resulting in higher PCE for the polymers. 29a-e P(C-TT-QP-Zn) showed lower EQE than P(C-TT-QP) with maximum EQE value of 44% at ∼ 480 nm. Additionally , a less than 10% difference between the J sc and the integral of the EQE is observed. Since the EQE was tested in the air , this discrepancy should be mainly ascribed to the degradation caused by the oxidation of the Ca electrode. We noted that Wong et al. also found the zinc porphyrin derivative functioned worse in solar cells than the free - base porphyrin derivatives , 30 and they attributed the poor performance of solar cell to the less stable of zinc porphyrin. However , in this work , we observed that the zinc porphyrin polymer possesses better thermal stability than their free - base analogues. Considering the fact that the P(C-TT-QP-Zn) possesses the highest hole mobility and the strongest and the widest absorption among the four polymers , herein , we conjectured the possible reason for the worst performance of P(C-TT-QP-Zn) - based PSC is the film morphology of the P(C-TT-QP-Zn) / PC71BM blend. In order to understand the effect of mophology of the photoactive layers on the photovoltaic performance of the polymer solar cells , the mophological structures of the blend films of polymer / PC71BM were analyzed by tapping mode atom force microscopy ( AFM ) measurements. Figure 11 shows the AFM images of the blend films. The blend films based on P(C-TT-QP) and P(C-TT-QP-Zn) both demonstrated low roughness of 1.05 and 1.29 nm , respectively. The P(C-TT-QP) / PC71BM blend possesses higher FF due to its smoother surface. For the P(C-TT-QP) / PC71BM blend film , the bright patterns of polymer domains showed a good interpenetrating network which is beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport.",

Polythiophene derivatives have attracted a great deal of attention in organic electronics due to their fascinating optical and electronic properties. 1 A promising application is use of these materials as the active semiconducting layers in organic solar cells where solution processability can be exploited in the fabrication of large area , low - cost , and flexible devices. 2,3 For example , a commonly used polymer donor material is the well - studied poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , and PCE in excess of 5% have been reported for the P3HT / [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PC60BM ) BHJ photovoltaic cells. [4][5][6] Besides P3HT polymer , many conjugated materials with a thiophene backbone are also well studied. Recently , Ong et al. reported a new class of solution processable high - performance polythiophene , poly(3,3'''-didodecylquaterthiophene) ( PQT ) [7][8] ( Scheme 1 ) , for organic field effect transistors ( OFETs ) , which is similar to P3HT in structures and also shows similar absorption spectra. Compared to P3HT , PQT has longer alkyl side chains to induce a better crystalline structure for higher hole mobility ( 0.18 cm^2 °V -1 °s -1 ) , 7 which is nearly twice as large as that of P3HT ( 0.1 cm^2 °V -1 °s -1 ). 9,10 In addition , PQT exhibits about 0.1 eV lower lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) levels ( -5.1 eV ) than P3HT. 7 Such lowered ionization energy could also be of interest for enhancing chemical stability of the compound as well as device lifetime. 11 Since the V oc of organic solar cells is limited by the difference of the HOMO level of the electron donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) level of the electron acceptor , solar cells using PQT as electron donor should reach higher V oc than those based on P3HT. 12 Hence , due to its lower HOMO level and higher hole mobility , together with a similar broad absorption spectrum to P3HT , which are the most important parameters for a successful polymer donor in photovoltaic devices , PQT offers the potential to be used in polymer / fullerene BHJ photovoltaic cells. However , the BHJ photovoltaic devices using P3HT exhibited far superior to those using PQT.",

    "sentence": "[13][14][15] To the best of our knowledge , PQT / PC60BM system produced the best device with optimal PCE of 1.15% for a PC60BM loading of 80 wt % . 16 By using the fullerene derivative PC70BM instead of PC60BM , the PCE of 1.4% could be obtained. 17 The differences in device performance for these two similar polymers necessitate the studies on the relationships between solid structure - property properties. Scherf et al. have made a comparative study between P3HT and PQT. The authors found that PQT forms nanoparticle dispersions in solution. The devices made from mixtures of PQT and fullerene consequently contained pre-formed PQT crystalline nanoparticles that cause mesoscopically demixed blends with low charge - separation efficiency. 16 However , Mcgehee and coworkers observed that PC60BM molecules can intercalate into the alkyl chains and form a cocrystallized structure in solid state , which might be a reason for its low efficiency. 18,19 Beside these morphological explorations , it is also of interest to design and synthesize QT - based copolymers with new functionalities. In order to improve PCEs , the most common and successful strategy is decreasing the band gaps of polymer donors so as to maintain a broad overlap with the solar spectrum and ensure effective harvesting of solar photons. This leads to higher J sc , 20,21 and lowers HOMO energy levels of polymer donors to gain larger V oc . 22 In an effort to tailoring the structure of PQT for optimized BHJ photovoltaic cells , we have synthesized two new QT - based copolymers , namely PQTF and PQTTST by introducing the fluorene and 2,5-dithienylsilole units as strategic building blocks. Fluorene has excellent oxidation stability and high hole mobility , making it beneficial for reducing HOMO energy level of polymer donors. 23 On the other hand , the 2,5-dithienylsilole units have the high electron - accepting ability due to σ*-π* conjugation in the ring , which thus have been exploited to tune the LUMO energy level and to gain narrow band gaps. 24,25 The influence on the thermal properties , morphology and energy levels by introducing fluorene and 2,5-dithienylsilole units into the backbone have been investigated. And a comparison between the photovoltaic properties based on the copolymers donors PQTF , PQTTST and homopolymer PQT have also carried out . The structure order of QT - based polymer thin films were studied by GIWAXS. Thin film samples were prepared on a silicon substrate by spin - coating from their chlorobenzene solutions. A 0.16 o incident angle was used in the experiment. As shown in Fig. 4 , PQT showed several obvious diffraction peaks in the out - of - plane direction , which characterized the structure normal to the substrates.",

Also a weak diffraction peak at 1.7 A -1 in the in-plane direction was observed , which comes from π-π staking. A shallow diffraction ring at 1.5 A -1 was observed and was ascribed to some disordered peak , yet its nature is still not clear. Compare to PQT , PQTF and PQTTST showed a much weaker first ordered peak in diffraction , as shown in figure 4b , and the position is slightly shifted to low q , indicating a spacing change. A diffraction ring at 1.46 A -1 and 1.35 A -1 was observed for PQTF and PQTTST , respectively. They are similar to the 1.5 A -1 diffraction from PQT , which we think they come from disordered alky chain stacking . Fig. 5 shows the UV - vis absorption spectra of polymers coated from the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution. It 's obvious that the absorption maximum for PQT was found to be 535 nm with a shoulder around at 575 nm. 7 The maximum absorption peaks of PQTF and PQTTST in the film were blue - shifted and red - shifted to 487 and 556 nm , respectively. We reasoned that it was caused by the change of conjugation length due to the introduction of fluorene and 2,5-diarylsilole units. Therefore , the optical band gaps ( E g ) of the PQT , PQTF and PQTTST , estimated from the absorption onset wavelength , were as low as 1.87 , 2.0 and 1.79 eV , respectively. The lowered band gap of PQTTST provides favorable light harvesting properties. The electrochemical properties of polymers were studied by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). According to de Leeuw et al. , the ionization potential ( E HOMO ) and electron affinity ( E LUMO ) are approximately equal to the onset of first oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential ( vs. Ag / Ag + ) plus 4.7 eV , respectively. 33 The anodic scan showed that the onset of oxidation for PQT , PQTF and PQTTST occurred at 0.36 , 0.62 and 0.34 eV , respectively , which corresponded to HOMO levels of -5.06 , -5.32 and -5.04 eV ( Fig. 6 ). It is observed that the HOMO level of PQTF was significantly reduced ( -5.32 eV ) as a result of incorporation of the higher ionization potential of fluorene unit , which is beneficial for achieving a high V oc in solar cells. However , no significant change in the oxidative properties was observed between PQT and PQTTST.",

    "sentence": "When scanning cathodically , all the copolymers exhibited reversible reduction waves , and the onset potentials of reduction for PQT , PQTF and PQTTST are -1.29 , -1.27 and -1.11 eV , respectively , corresponding to LUMO levels of -3.41 , -3.43 and -3.59 eV. The LUMO energy levels of PQT and PQTF lied with slight variation. However , the introduction of 2,5-diarylsilole units obviously reduced the LUMO level , which may be ascribed to the particularly low lying LUMO of the 2,5-diarylsilole units. Compared to PQT , incorporation fluorene into the backbone of PQTF only reduced the HOMO level , while the LUMO level was hardly changed. In a similar manner , incorporation of 2,5-diarylsilole in PQTTST only reduced the LUMO level , while the HOMO level was hardly influenced. PQTTST showed the smallest band gap of 1.45 eV estimated from redox properties ( Table 1 ). Such low band gap improves light absorption , leading to enhanced J sc . The energy levels and UV - vis absorption spectra are in good agreement . Photovoltaic characteristics were investigated with the conventional architecture of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC60BM / LiF / Al. For optimal photovoltaic performance , the best polymer / PC60BM weight ratio is approximately 1 : 4. Fig. 7 shows the current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves under solar simulator AM 1.5 illumination , and the photovoltaic properties of the devices are summarized in Table 2. PQT / PC60BM system showed a PCE of 1.03% , with a J sc of 3.30 mA cm^-2 , V oc of 0.71 V and fill factor ( FF ) of 0.44. This photovoltaic performance is similar to the Scherf 's report. 16 Devices fabricated using PQTF and PQTTST as polymer donor showed considerably enhanced performance with a PCE of 1.39% and 1.49% , respectively. It is important to note that the value of PCE for PQTTST / PC60BM device is so far the highest record of QT - based polymer materials. The performance improvement from the PQT / PC60BM to the PQTF / PC60BM system was mainly attributed to the increase in both V oc ( from 0.71 to 0.85 V ) and the fill factor ( from 0.44 to 0.51 ) , while the performance improvement of the PQTTST / PC60BM system was mainly due to increase of J sc ( from 3.30 to 4.77 mA cm^-2 ). The improvement in OPV performance by introducing fluorene and 2,5-diarylsilole units into the PQT backbone can be explained in terms of the energy level structures. Compared to PQT , PQTF has the lower HOMO level. Generally , the lower HOMO levels of the polymer donor , the higher the V oc . However , a lower HOMO level would lead to an increased band gap in the polymer donor and less efficient light absorption ( See UV - vis absorption part ). So PQTF / PC60BM system showed a lowest J sc of 3.08 mA cm^-2 .",

Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted increasing attention because they have shown promising potential as a result of their unique advantages such as low cost , light weight , and large - area fabrication on flexible substrates. 1 Recently , great advances have achieved in development of novel photovoltaic polymers and device structures. 2-12 The power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) can now reach 7-8 % . 13-18 It is worthy of mentioning that the large planar benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene ( BDT ) unit has emerged as an attractive building block for high - efficiency photovoltaic polymers. 13,15-18 For solution processing , the use of long alkyl or alkoxy side chains has been a common approach to modify the BDT unit. 15-17,19-22 However , the side - chain nature not only affects the molecular weight and solubility of the polymers but also affects the absorption , energy levels , and charge transport properties. 23-29 In particular , the side chain affects morphology of blends of polymer donors and fullerene acceptors and finally affects the photovoltaic performance of devices. 23-29 In order to further improve solar cell efficiency , it is necessary to explore other type side chains to modify the BDT unit , for example , thiophene side chains. 18,30,31 Bulky triisopropylsilylethynyl ( TIPS ) groups on acene derivatives not only improve the solubility and oxidative stability of the semiconductors but also promote the π-orbital overlap. As a result , TIPS - functionalized acenes gained importance as a class of highly soluble , air - stable , high - performance p - type organic semiconductors. 32,33 The small molecules and polymers based on TIPS - substituted acenes were also used in organic photovoltaic cells as electron donors or acceptors with PCEs as high as 2.25% .",

Thiazolothiazole ( TT ) has a rigid and coplanar fused ring and thereby could facilitate highly extended π-electron system and ' . PBDTTT - TIPS has a number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of 12^000 , weight - average molecular weight ( M w ) of 19^000 , and polydispersity index ( M w / M n ) of 1.6. PBDTTT - TIPS shows excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperature of 377 °C ( at 5% weight loss ) , as measured by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) at a heating rate of 20 °C min -1 under nitrogen ( Figure 2 ). I DS = ( W / 2L)μC i ( V G - V T ) Optical Properties. Figure 3 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDTTT - TIPS in chloroform solution ( 10^-6 M ) and in thin film ( spin - coated from chloroform solution ). The copolymer PBDTTT - TIPS in solution shows two intense absorption peaks at 548 and 586 nm , which red shift 6 and 12 nm from solution to film , respectively. Compared with PBDTTT - C12 , PBDTTT - TIPS exhibits red - shifted absorption ( 4 nm in solution ; 14 nm in film ). The red shift of absorption for PBDTTT - TIPS mainly benefits from the weak electron - withdrawing and conjugated TIPS side chains. The optical bandgap of PBDTTT - TIPS estimated from the absorption edge in film is 1.94 eV , which is a little lower than that ( 1.99 eV ) of PBDTTT - C12. Electrochemical Properties. The cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) curves of copolymer PBDTTT - TIPS and FeCp 2 + / 0 are illustrated in Figure 4. PBDTTT - TIPS displays irreversible oxidation and reduction waves. The onset oxidation and reduction potentials versus Ag are 1.0 and -1.3 V , respectively. The onset oxidation and reduction potentials versus FeCp 2 + / 0 ( halfwave potential of 0.5 eV ) are 0.5 and -1.8 V , respectively. Therefore , the HOMO and LUMO energies are estimated to be -5.3 and -3.0 eV from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials , respectively , assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp 2 + / 0 to be 4.8 eV below vacuum. Compared with PBDTTT - TIPS , PBDTTT - C12 exhibits same HOMO level but 0.2 eV higher LUMO level. The trends in the electrochemical data are therefore consistent with that in the absorption maxima and also can be attributed to the weak electron - withdrawing TIPS group. The lower LUMO level deduced from TIPS side chain was also reported in the literature.",

    "sentence": "38 Organic Field - Effect Transistors. To ensure effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes and reduce the photocurrent loss in solar cells , the high hole mobility is a basic requirement for electron donors. To measure mobilities of PBDTTT - TIPS , organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) were fabricated on octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-treated SiO 2 / Si substrates through spincoating process. The typical p - type output curve and the corresponding transfer characteristics in air are depicted in Figure 5 , which exhibits good current modulation and well - defined linear and saturation regions like PBDTTT - C12. 42 The highest hole mobility of the devices based on PBDTTT - TIPS in the saturation regime is 1.2 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , while average mobility ( 5 devices ) is 9.4 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , a little lower but in the same order with that of PBDTTT - C12 ( 2.8 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). The average on / off current ratio ( I on / I off ) is 600. Photovoltaic Properties. We use PBDTTT - TIPS as an electron donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor and fabricate bulk heterojunction PSCs with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM / Ca / Al to demonstrate the potential application of PBDTTT - TIPS in PSCs. The solvents used for device fabrication will dramatically affect the morphology of blend film and the resulting device performance. Compared to PBDTTT - C12 , PBDTTT - TIPS has a better solubility in common solvents , such as chloroform , THF , chlorobenzene , and dichlorobenzene. The PBDTTT - C12 / PC71BM blend has good solubility in chloroform but poor solubility in chlorobenzene. Therefore , the best device performance based on PBDTTT - C12 was obtained from chloroform solution. However , the PBDTTT - TIPS / PC71BM blend has good solubility in chloroform and in chlorobenzene. The devices based on PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM = 1 : 1 spin - coated from chlorobenzene solution exhibited much higher PCE ( 4.33% ) than that obtained from chloroform solution ( 1.3% ) since the solvent with high boiling point would be more beneficial to forming good - quality films. Therefore , we choose chlorobenzene other than chloroform for PBDTTT - TIPS - based device fabrication. Figure 6 shows current density-voltage curves , and Table 1 summarizes the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short circuit current density ( J sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the devices. When PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM weight ratio is 1 : 2 , the PCE of device is 3.67% , which is higher than that for PBDTTT - C12 - based device ( 2.19% ). When PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM weight ratio is 1 : 1 , the device exhibit the highest PCE of 4.33% with V oc of 0.89 V , J sc of 9.77 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 49.8% .",

    "sentence": "The change in performance with donor / acceptor weight ratio has correlation with the tendency of donor polymer to mix with fullerene acceptor , phase separation , and charge transport. Generally , for polymer donors with high hole mobilities ( > 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) , such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) and PBDTTT - TIPS , the percolation pathways for hole transport are well formed at donor / acceptor weight ratio of 1 : 1 , leading to higher PCEs. While for polymer donors with low hole mobilities ( < 10^-5 cm V -1 s^-1 ) , such as poly[2-methoxy-5-(2 0 -ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene ] ( MEH - PPV ) , the percolation pathways for electron transport are well formed at high acceptor concentration ( e.g. , 80% ) , leading to higher PCEs. 5 As shown in Figure 7 , the incident photon to converted current efficiency ( IPCE ) curve resembles absorption spectrum of the blend thin film of PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) , and the IPCE exhibits a broad plateau with IPCE values over 50% between 350 and 620 nm , leading to a high J sc of 9.77 mA cm^-2 . However , the PBDTTT-C12:PC71BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) blend gives a lower IPCE level between 300 and 700 nm , leading to a lower J sc of 4.36 mA cm^-2 , which is only half of that for PBDTTT - TIPS : PC71BM device. Although PBDTTT - TIPS and PBDTTT - C12 exhibit similar absorption , HOMO level , and hole mobility , they exhibit big difference in photovoltaic performance. To elucidate the origin , we investigate blend film morphology using atomic force microscope ( AFM ) ( Figure 8 ). For PBDTTT-TIPS:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) blend , the films exhibit a typical cluster structure with many aggregated domains and a root-mean-square ( rms ) roughness of 1.472 nm. The domain sizes estimated by cross-section profiles are about 10-20 nm. Therefore , the nanoscale aggregated domains and perfect phase separation are beneficial to charge separation and enhanced efficiency of the PSC. In contrast , the PBDTTT-C12:PC71BM blend film exhibits large phase separation and large rms roughness up to 8.218 nm. This large phase separation scale is not favorable for efficient exciton dissociation , leading to relatively low J sc . The blend film morphology indicates that PBDTTT - TIPS has a better compatibility with PC71BM than PBDTTT - C12. Nguyen et al. found that in a poly (3-alkylthiophenes)(P3AT):PC61BM system the longer side chains of P3AT enable the higher diffusion rate of PC61BM in the polymer matrix and ultimately lead to a larger scale phase separation. 51 A new conjugated copolymer PBDTTT - TIPS containing thiazolothiazole acceptor unit and TIPS - functionalized benzodithiophene donor unit is synthesized by Pd - catalyzed Stille coupling. PBDTTT - TIPS exhibits excellent thermal stability , broad absorption , high hole mobility , and relatively low HOMO level.",

Compared with the copolymer PBDTT-TT , TEO side chains induce more ordered molecular Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in making large - area , lightweight and exible photovoltaic devices through roll - to - roll printing. [1][2][3][4][5] Bulk hetero - junction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells , whose photoactive layer is composed of an interpenetrating network of electron donor materials and electron acceptor materials , have been one of the most successful device structures to date. [6][7][8][9][10][11][12] Recently , a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) over 7% has been effortlessly reached in the research eld of PSCs. [13][14][15] The nanomorphology of the active layer is one of the most important factors that inuences the efficiency of polymer solar cells. In optimized BHJ polymer solar cells , phase separation of the donor ( D ) and acceptor ( A ) materials should be on the same length - scale as the exciton diffusion length to facilitate efficient exciton harvesting and separation. Therefore , local conjugated polymer ordering , acceptor agglomeration and the phase separation between the donor and acceptor are directly correlated to the performance of the devices. The addition of chemical additives , [16][17][18] thermal annealing treatments , and solvent annealing 19 are among the frequentlyused post-treatments for controlling the morphology in polymer - fullerene BHJ solar cells. Beyond these post-treatments , chemical structural modication of the active layers is regarded as an effective strategy for developing a desirable microphase separation morphology of the active layers. Previous studies have found that the incorporation of alkoxy side chains into active layers , especially ter(ethylene oxide ) ( TEO ) chains , presents several advantages over alkyl groups. [20][21][22][23][24][25] Firstly , alkoxy chains do not cause a disadvantageous steric twist of the conjugated polymer out of planarity , which is benecial to transport charge and can lead to higher carrier mobility. 25,26 Secondly , TEO derivatives can generally lead to good crystallinity , 27 which is quite important to optimize the morphology of the active layers. Besides , polymers loaded with alkoxy chains have good solubility in common solvents , 25,26 such as chloroform , chlorobenzene and orthodichloro-benzene , which makes it convenient and possible to use them in organic solar cells. The lifetime of solar devices also importantly affects their commercialization. In fact , most PSC devices show poor stability and oen undergo macrophase segregation of the blend components , especially aer a prolonged exposure to heat. 28 However , the morphology of the D-A blends is normally very sensitive to the fabrication procedures and the heating process , and can not be maintained over long operation times.",

[30][31][32] However , the existence of these cross-linkable moieties reduces the probability that molecules come into close contact with each other , thereby lowering the mobility of electrons in the material. 33 To simultaneously achieve the favorable and stable morphology of the active layer , herein , the TEO functionalized copolymer donor PBDTT-TT-TEO and fullerene acceptor PCB - TEO are explored ( Schemes 1 and 2 ). The copolymer poly{4,8bis ( 5-(2-ethylhexyl) [3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl-2-ethylhexan-1-one } ( PBDTT-TT ) without TEO side chains was also synthesized for comparison. We hoped that the cooperative assembly of the donor and acceptor via interchain interactions between the TEO side chains could construct a microphase separation nanostructure with promoted stability for highly efficient PSCs. Unexpectedly , directly blending PBDTT-TT-TEO with PCB - TEO as the active layer only affords a 2.8% PCE in the resulting device due to the discontinuous morphology of the blend lm caused by the poor solubility of PCB - TEO. However , an appropriate amount of PCB - TEO as a compatibilizer incorporated into the PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM blend can dramatically improve the device performance and stability , because PCB - TEO , which is chemically similar to the segments in PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCBM , can be located at the interface of the donor and acceptor to manipulate the miscibility between the polymer and fullerene and achieve a favorable and stable BHJ morphology by a cooperative assembly effect. The device with 5% loading of PCB - TEO achieves the highest PCE of 4.8% , approximately a 33% improvement in PCE over the PBDTT - TT : PCBM device. thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene- alt-4,6-thieno The synthetic routes of copolymers PBDTT-TT-TEO and PBDTT-TT are outlined in Scheme 1. 4,6-Dibromo-thieno [3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylic acid was reacted with TEO via an esterication reaction to yield the monomer 4,6-dibromo-thieno [ 3,4- The structures of the monomer TT - TEO and copolymers have been conrmed by 1H NMR , as shown in Fig. S1 and S2. † Compared with PBDTT-TT , copolymer PBDTT-TT-TEO shows the characteristic resonance peaks of TEO from 3.2 to 4.0 ppm , indicating the successful synthesis of the copolymer.

    "sentence": "† Unfortunately , PCB - TEO shows relatively poor solubility in common organic solvents , especially in chlorobenzene and orthodichlorobenzene. The thermal properties of the copolymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min -1 ( Fig. S4 † ). The temperature at 5% weight loss was chosen as the onset point of decomposition ( T d ). Similar to the polymer PBDTT-TT , PBDTT-TT-TEO shows little weight loss when heated up to 366 °C , suggesting that the introduction of TEO chains into the PBDTT-TT does not inuence the thermal stability of the polymer. Evidently , this is sufficient for its applications in BHJ solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. Fig. 1 shows the UV - vis absorption spectra of the PBDTT-TT and PBDTT-TT-TEO lms. The absorption spectrum of the PBDTT-TT lm shows maximum absorption at 696 nm , while the PBDTT-TT-TEO lm shows the highest peak at 701 nm. The slightly red shied band of PBDTT-TT-TEO indicates that PBDTT-TT-TEO possesses a longer efficient conjugation length than PBDTT - TT. This is because the TEO side chains can reduce the detrimental steric twist of the polymer out of planarity , which is benecial for the p-p stacking. 34 Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of polymers and estimate their highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential according to equations reported in the literature. 35 Fig. S5 † shows the cyclic voltammogram curves of the two copolymers. PBDTT-TT and PBDTT-TT-TEO possess almost identical electrochemical redox characteristics. For PBDTT-TT , the onset potential for oxidation is located around 0.27 V versus Ag / AgNO 3 , which corresponds to a highest occupied molecular orbital of -5.09 eV. The LUMO energy level of PBDTT-TT is calculated to be -3.22 eV based on the onset potential for reduction at around -1.60 V. Using similar methods , the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PBDTT-TT-TEO are -5.07 and -3.23 eV , respectively. From the results , we can draw the conclusion that PBDTT-TT-TEO has a relatively narrower band gap than PBDTT-TT , which is in line with the results of the UV - vis spectra. Because polymer chain packing can affect exciton dissociation , recombination and charge transport , 36 the crystalline structures of the donor - acceptor lms blended with different amounts of additive were observed by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) measurement. Fig. S6 † shows the XRD patterns of PBDTT-TT and PBDTT-TT-TEO. Both polymers show crystalline diffraction peaks at a low angle ( x 5.0 ) , which is attributed to a lamellar structure. The crystalline diffraction peak of PBDTT-TT-TEO is slightly sharper than that of PBDTT-TT , meaning that PBDTT-TT-TEO has a more ordered molecular packing structure , which is consistent with the UV observation.",

    "sentence": "To determine the photovoltaic properties of the TEO functionalized copolymer , BHJ devices based on PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM are fabricated , and the device based on PBDTT-TT blended with PCBM is also provided for comparison. The conguration of the device is glass / ITO / PEDOT : PSS / copolymer : PCBM / LiF / Al. Fig. 2 shows the I-V curves for solar cells under simulated AM 1.5 G radiation ( 100 mW cm^-2 ) ; the optimized photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 2. All of the devices based on PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM with different weight ratios perform better than those based on PBDTT - TT : PCBM. The best PCE of 4.1% is obtained from the device based on PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM at a weight ratio of 1 : 2 , together with a short - circuit current ( J sc ) of 11.63 mA cm^-2 , an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.727 V and a ll factor ( FF ) of 48.1% , while the device based on PBDTT - TT : PCBM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) obtains an inferior PCE of 3.6% , with a J sc of 11.09 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.726 V and a FF of 44.5% . The improved PCE is related to the enhanced J sc and FF , which should arise from the more ordered molecular packing structure of PBDTT-TT-TEO , resulting in more efficient carrier transport in the active layer. To further improve the PCE , the device based on PBDTT-TT-TEO blended with PCB - TEO containing the same functional group was fabricated. Using this approach , the cooperative assembly of the TEO chains in both the donor and acceptor develops the ordered microphase - separation nanomorphology for PCE enhancement. Unexpectedly , the devices based on PBDTT-TT-TEO:PCB-TEO only obtained a low PCE of 2.8% with a dramatically reduced FF ( Fig. 3 and Table 3 ). The poor performance can be ascribed to the discontinuous lm morphology caused by the poor solubility of PCB - TEO in organic solvents , as revealed by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) observation ( Fig. S7 † ). Using a compatibilizer has been proven to be an effective approach to improve the formation of the D-A nanoscale interpenetrating network. Since the PCB - TEO did not perform satisfactorily as an acceptor in the PSCs owing to its poor solubility , it could be used as a compatibilizer in PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM blends to modify the nanostructure of the active layer. Considering that PCB - TEO contains the same segment as both PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCBM , the compatibility between the immiscible PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCBM can be enhanced via PCB - TEO , preferentially located at the donor and acceptor interface to span the heterojunction itself , consequently ensuring good miscibility in the system. The solar cell performance of the PBDTT-TT-TEO:PCBM:PCB-TEO ternary system is provided in Table 3 and Fig. 3.",

    "sentence": "As expected , with the addition of an appropriate amount of PCB - TEO into the PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM blend , the PCE of the device dramatically increases and the device with 5% loading of PCB - TEO achieves the highest PCE of 4.8% , with a J sc of 12.18 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.722 V and a FF of 55.0% . Compared to the PBDTT - TT : PCBM device , the PCB - TEO compatibilizer promotes approximately a 33% improvement in PCE , a 24% improvement in FF and a 10% improvement in J sc . The enhanced FF is associated with the remarkably improved R sh from 197.8 U cm^2 ( without a PCB - TEO compatibilizer ) to 469.4 U cm^2 ( with a PCB - TEO compatibilizer ). Further increasing the loading of PCB - TEO to 10% results in a sharp decrease in the overall parameters ( PCE = 4.0% , FF = 50.2% , J sc = 11.03 mA cm^-2 ) , except for the almost unchanged V oc which is mainly determined by the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. In addition , PCB - TEO was also incorporated into the PBDTT - TT : PCBM blends without TEO for comparison , and the corresponding performance is shown in Table S1 ( Fig. S8 ). † Due to the lack of TEO in the PBDTT-TT donor , the PCB - TEO compatibilizer can not serve the same role on PBDTT-TT as on PBDTT-TT-TEO. Therefore , the device only delivers a PCE of 3.2% for 3% loading of PCB - TEO and 2.7% for 5% loading of PCB - TEO. From the device performance , it can be concluded that incorporation of TEO into the donor and acceptor can result in an improved PCE by enhancing the J sc and FF. of PCBM is replaced by PCB - TEO , the absorption intensity further increases , and the blends with 5% and 10% of PCB - TEO present the strongest absorption at the solar ux region. This is because the PCB - TEO preferentially located at the donor and acceptor interface favors more ordered arrangements via the interaction between the same TEO side chains. The enhanced absorption peaks should be responsible for the enhanced J sc . No obvious distinction between X-ray diffraction patterns can be seen in Fig. 5 when blending the two polymers with PCBM. However , slightly increasing the loading of the PCB - TEO additive from 3% to 10% causes the crystalline diffraction peak at a low angle to become sharper and move to a higher angle. The result indicates that the cooperative assembly between PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCB - TEO can enhance the crystallinity of the polymer crystallites and cause tighter packing of the lamellar structure. The self - aggregation tendency induced by cooperative assembly of the TEO side chains is essential for transport of the holes and electrons.",

    "sentence": "To gain a deeper insight into the morphologies of the active layers , the surfaces of the donor - acceptor blends have been studied by AFM ( Fig. 6 ). The PBDTTT-TT-TEO : PCBM lm reveals a rough surface morphology with a root-mean-square ( RMS ) roughness of 1.12 nm at a 1 mm x 1 mm scan size. This obvious phase separation may produce poor contact between the active layer and the electrode , and yield unfavorable conditions for charge separation and transport. With the addition of 3% PCB - TEO into the lm , a better surface morphology with a reduced RMS roughness of 0.93 nm is developed , while the best - optimized morphology can be acquired with a RMS roughness of 0.51 nm for the lm with 5% PCB - TEO. As shown in Fig. 6 , the miscibility of PBDTTT-TT-TEO Table 2 Solar cell performance parameters of PBDTT - TT : PCBM ( 1 : 2 w / w ) , PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM ( 1 : 2 w / w ) , PBDTT - TT : PCBM ( 1 : 1.5 w / w ) and PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM ( 1 : 1.5 w / w ) blends and PCBM is greatly enhanced , and PCBM is well dispersed in the polymer matrix with the addition of 5% PCB - TEO to the blend. The smooth and homogenous morphology can provide a nano-scale bi-continuous network of donor and acceptor materials for efficient charge dissociation and transportation , leading to a high PCE. The smoothest lm with a RMS roughness of 0.36 nm is obtained from the blend with 10% loading of PCB - TEO. However , too much PCB - TEO leads to a large phase separation , as revealed by Fig. 6. Therefore , a sharp decrease in PCE is seen. For PBDTT - TT : PCBM , without the cooperative assembly of TEO side chains , adding only 3% PCB - TEO into the active layer produces a predominantly macrophase aggregation ( Fig. S9 † ) . The morphologies of the PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM and PBDTT-TT-TEO:PCBM:PCB-TEO ( 5% PCB - TEO ) lms are further investigated by planar transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( Fig. 7 ). The bright and dark parts represent the polymer - rich and PCBM - rich domains , respectively. The big PCBM clusters can be clearly distinguished from the dark areas in the TEM image of the PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM blend ( Fig. 7 ). In contrast , adding 5% PCB - TEO into the blend induces a homogeneous morphology of the polymer and PCBM with equal domain size. Therefore , from the device performance , light absorption and morphology , it is determined that incorporation of a TEO side chain into the active layer obviously improves the degree of ordering in the blend lm.",

    "sentence": "More importantly , by precisely controlling the loading of PCB - TEO , it can serve as an effective compatibilizer to manipulate the miscibility between the donor and acceptor and the scale of the phase separation in the PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM blend by a cooperative assembly effect , consequently achieving a favorable BHJ morphology and improving the device performance. A schematic illustration of the cooperative assembly structure of PBDTT-TT-TEO:PCBM:PCB-TEO is depicted in Scheme 3. Since the PCB - TEO compatibilizer favors good miscibility of PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCBM via interaction with the TEO side chains and fullerene , a good morphological stability of the blends is also anticipated. Fig. 8 shows the variation in device performance with PBDTT - TT : PCBM ( 1 : 2 w / w ) , PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM ( 1 : 2 w / w ) and PBDTT-TT-TEO:PCBM:PCB-TEO ( 1 : 1.90 : 0.10 w / w ) annealed at 150 °C for different times in a glove box under a N 2 atmosphere. The inert atmosphere is introduced to exclude the inuence of humidity and oxygen and allow us to focus on the inuence of a morphological change on the device performance under elevated temperature. PBDTT-TT based devices show a rapid degradation in the PCE , especially during the rst 1 h ( less than 70% ) , and only 25% of the PCE remains aer annealing for 8 h. However , both the PBDTT-TT-TEO based devices show better stability. The PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM device maintains 56% of the PCE and the device composed of PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCBM with 5% PCB - TEO maintains 75% of the PCE aer heating for 8 h. Fig. 9 shows optical images of the morphology changes of the PBDTT - TT : PCBM , PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM and PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM ( 5% PCB - TEO ) lms before and aer annealing at 150 °C for 8 h. All of the lms have a homogeneous morphology without large PCBM crystals before thermal treatment. However , aer annealing at 150 °C for 8 h , numerous needle - like PCBM crystals appear over all of the regions in the PBDTT-TT based samples. This kind of large - scale macro-phase separation is the main reason for the deterioration of the device performance. 37,38 In the thermally annealed PBDTT-TT-TEO : PCBM lm , there are still some PCBM crystals. Nevertheless , for the PBDTT-TT-TEO:PCBM:PCB-TEO ( 5% ) blend , due to the PCB - TEO compatibilizer located at the interface of the donor and acceptor to strengthen the interaction of PBDTT-TT-TEO with PCBM , the formation of large PCBM crystals is found to be greatly suppressed , consequently leading to the enhanced thermal stability of the devices. 20,39 In summary , we have presented a novel approach by combining TEO functionalized copolymer donor PBDTT-TT-TEO and fullerene acceptor PCB - TEO to manipulate the self - assembly nanoscale morphology and enhance the stability of the photoactive layer in polymer solar cells.",

PCB - TEO , chemically similar to the segments in PBDTT-TT-TEO and PCBM , can be located at the interface of the donor and acceptor to manipulate the miscibility between the polymer and fullerene and achieve a favorable and stable BHJ morphology by a cooperative assembly effect. In addition , good miscibility of the donor and acceptor helped by PCB - TEO greatly improves the morphological stability of the blends and the thermally stability of the device. All of these features indicate that cooperative assembly of a TEO functionalized copolymer and fullerene is a promising approach to develop photoactive layers in polymer solar cells with a well - dened and stable morphology .",

Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted tremendous interest due to their potentials in providing clean energy. As known , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) , one of the key parameters for PSCs , can be affected by many factors including the natures of the materials used in the devices and the architectures of the devices. The application of novel donor polymers provides an efficient approach to enhance the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. 1-6 In recent years , the donor - acceptor ( D-A ) copolymers which consist of electron - donating and -withdrawing building blocks have been widely used as the electron donors in highly efficient PSCs due to their superiorities in realizing tunable properties like absorption spectra , molecular energy levels , mobilities , etc. Therefore , many new building blocks with electron - rich properties , like dithienosilole ( DTS ) 7-12 and benzodithiophene ( BDT ) , 13-18 were designed and applied in constructing photovoltaic polymers , and these building blocks have played critical roles in promoting the development of the PSC field. In 2011 , the dithienogermole ( DTG ) unit was synthesized and successfully applied in designing highly efficient photovoltaic polymers. The D-A copolymers containing DTG commonly show strong π-π stacking interaction and thus highly ordered crystalline structures in solid state.",

As shown in Figure 1b , there are no apparent exothermic and endothermic peaks in DSC analysis for all the four polymers. X-ray Diffraction Analysis. The formation of ordered structure within thin polymer film can be investigated by the Xray diffraction ( XRD ) measurement. The XRD patterns of the thin films of these four polymers casted from chloroform are shown in Figure 2a. The results indicate that all these four polymers show two pronounced reflections. The peaks at low 2θ zone and high 2θ zone are attributed to the ordered laminar packing and interchain π-π stacking , respectively. According to the Bragg equation and the reflection peaks , the d-spacing of the laminar packing and the distance of the π-π stacking of the polymers can be calculated. As listed in Table 1 , the d-spacings of the laminar packing for PDTG - BDD , PDTG - IID , PDTG-BT , and PDTG - DPP are 16.47 , 10.09 , 16.81 , and 17.24 Å , respectively. The XRD data of DTG-BT were consistent with the reported work. 50 Clearly , PDTG - DPP shows the longer dspacing for laminar packing than the other three polymers , which should be ascribed to the long alkyl side chains on the DPP units. Moreover , these polymers show different π-π stacking distances , which are 4.07 , 3.74 , 3.53 , and 3.69 Å for PDTG - BDD , PDTG - IID , PDTG-BT , and PDTG - DPP , respectively. Obviously , PDTG-BT has smaller π-π stacking distances than the other three polymers.

Additionally , the HOMO level and E g opt of PDTG-BT are slightly different with previously reported. 26,27 Compared to their Si - bridged analogous , the DTS - based polymers , the DTG - based polymers usually have higher HOMO levels ; e.g. , the HOMO of PDTG - IID and PDTG-BT are -5.38 and -4.99 eV , respectively , which are all slightly higher than PDTS - IID ( HOMO = -5.55 eV ) 49 and PDTS-BT ( HOMO = -5.05 eV ). 7 As a result , V oc of PDTS - IID and PDTS-BT are higher than the DTG - based polymers , respectively. 51,52 For the comparison between PDTS-BT and PDTG-BT , the results were not in exact accordance with previous report , 53 which may be probably due to the effects of the alkyl chains. As listed in Table S5 , density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations by the B3LYP / 6-31G* basis were used to demonstrate the electronic structures ( HOMO and LUMO surfaces ) of the four DTG - based polymers , with a molecular main chain length n = 2. The molecular energy levels obtained from the CV measurements are coincident with the theoretical results obtained from the quantum chemical calculations. As shown in Figure S7 , the HOMO surfaces of the four DTGbased polymers are distributed along the conjugated backbone evenly. For PDTG - IID and PDTG-BT , LUMO surfaces are mainly located at the electron deficient units ( IID and BT , respectively ). Optical Properties. The absorption spectra of these four DTG - based polymers in chloroform solutions and as solid films are shown in Figures 2c and 2d , respectively. The four polymers show much different absorption spectra. As listed in Table 2 , the peaks of PDTG - BDD , PDTG - IID , PDTG-BT , and PDTG - DPP in solution are located at 595 , 750 , 688 , and 810 nm , respectively. From solution state to solid film , the absorption peaks of PDTG - BDD and PDTG-BT are red - shifted , while those of PDTG - IID and PDTG - DPP are blue - shifted.",

    "sentence": "These four polymers show much different absorption edges at long wavelength direction , and the optical band gaps are 1.65 eV for PDTG - BDD , 1.52 eV for PDTG - IID , 1.41 eV for PDTG-BT , and 1.30 eV for PDTG - DPP. Generally speaking , PDTG-BT and PDTG - DPP exhibit broader absorption spectra in long wavelength region than PDTG - BDD and PDTG - IID , probably meaning that higher photocurrent densities may be obtained in the PSCs based on PDTG-BT and PDTG - DPP than the other two polymers. Moreover , as listed in Table 2 , the four DTGbased polymers exhibit relatively high and much similar absorption coefficients in film , which are all around 0.9 × 10^-2 / nm , implying they would have no shortage in absorption coefficients. PDTG - IID and PDTG-BT show narrower optical band gaps , comparing to their Si - bridged analogous ; 51,52 however , the optical band gaps of PDTG - DPP and PDTS - DPP are very similar. 48 Photovoltaic Properties , External Quantum Efficiency , and Mobility. The bulk - heterojunction PSC devices with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymers : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated to investigate photovoltaic properties of these four DTG - based polymers. The active layers were prepared in the solutions of o-DCB with the concentration of 10 mg / mL ( polymer / o-DCB ). Different spin speeds were used to control the thickness of the active layers of the PSC devices. First , a series of D / A ( polymer / PC71BM , w / w ) ratios were scanned from 1 : 0.5 to 1 : 4 to get the optimal D / A ratios for each polymer. The current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves are provided in the Supporting Information , and the detailed data are collected in Table 3. It shows that the optimal D / A ratios for the PDTG-IID:PC71BM and PDTG-BT:PC71BM blends are 1 : 1 , and the optimal D / A ratios of for PDTG-DPP:PC71BM and PDTG-BDD:PC71BM are 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 , respectively. From the device based on PDTG-BDD:PC71BM with the optimal D / A ratio ( polymer : PC71BM = 1 : 3 ) , a PCE of 3.86% with V oc = 0.906 V , short circuit current density ( J sc ) = 8.66 mA / cm^2 , and fill factor ( FF ) = 49.3% can be recorded. The PCEs of the devices of PDTG - IID , PDTG-BT , and PDTG - DPP with optimal D / A ratios are 1.24 , 3.25 , and 0.61% , respectively.

When 7% DIO was added , the J sc of the PDTG - BDD devices slightly increased from 8.66 to 10.3 mA / cm^2 , while the FF was significantly improved from 49.3% to 65.0% , so that the PCEs of the devices increased from 3.86% to 6.28% .

The performance of devices based on PDTG - IID / PC71BM are higher than PDTS - IID / PC71BM system. 49,52 The improvement of the efficiency comes from the increase of J sc of the devices , which probably attributes to higher hole mobility of the DTG - based polymers and more favorable phase separation morphology of blend films. 53 The photovoltaic properties of the PDTG-BT - based device is not very sensitive to the use of DIO ; i.e. , for the PDTG-BT - based devices with and without the use of DIO , similar PCE values were recorded. The devices based on PDTG-BT in this work show higher V oc and FF than those of the reported works , which might be due to the difference of the molecular weight ; i.e. , the M n of PDTG-BT in the reported work is 31 K ( PDI = 3.2 ) , while in this work , the M n is 2.14K only ( PDI = 7.23 ). 50 Unfortunately , although the polymer PDTG - DPP shows the broadest absorption spectrum in these four polymers and the corresponding devices show relatively good FF values ( FF = 60% ) , the PSC devices based on this polymer exhibit much lower J sc values than the devices based on the other three polymers. External quantum efficiency ( EQE ) curves of the devices based on the four DTG - based polymers prepared through the optimal fabrication processes and the absorption spectra of the active layers of the devices are shown in Figures 4a and 4b.

The PSC devices based on the four DTG - based polymers were fabricated , and their photovoltaic properties were characterized.

    "sentence": "A simple approach was demonstrated to manipulate dipole moment of interlayer in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). The ionic liquid crystals ( ILCs ) 3-((2′-(4″-cyanobiphenyl-4yloxy)ethyl)dimethylammonio)propanesulfonate ( CbpNSO ) with zwitterionic charges were blended with cationic conjugated polyelectrolyte ( CPE ) poly [3-(6-trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophene] ( PTNBr ) to afford a novel CPE - ILC complex. The water / alcohol solubility of the CPE - ILC complex enables it to be green solvent processable. The spontaneous orientation of liquid crystal ( LC ) favors more ordered structural arrangement in CPE - ILC complexes. More importantly , LC - assistant assembly improves the orientation of dipole at cathode and significantly reduces the work function of ITO. The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of P3HT : PC 60 BM - based inverted PSCs with the layer of PTNBr - CbpNSO is increased by 37% with respect to that of the device with pure PTNBr. Incorporation of PTNBr - CbpNSO into the devices based on PBDTTT-C-T and PC71BM affords a notable PCE of 7.49% . It should be noted that mesogens reduce the activation energy of molecular reorganization and accelerate dipole orientation in CPE - ILC interlayer under external electric field , which enables the dipole of this interlayer can be readily manipulated. Because of the rapid orientation of the dipole , PTNBr - CbpNSO shows reversible dipole at the active layer / ITO interface during the reversible bias process . Research on bulk - heterojunction polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) has achieved tremendous progress during the past decade , due to their advantages of scalable printing manufacturing and low materials costs. 1 Power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs has successfully reached to 10% , with sophisticated design of novel light - harvesting polymers , usage of efficient device structures , development of new fabrication techniques , and incorporation of interfacial materials for electrode modification. 2 Interfacial materials play a crucial role in improving the performance of PSCs by favorable interfacial engineering , and an appropriate interfacial material could efficiently hamper the excitons recombination and lower the contact resistance at the light - harvesting layer / electrode interface. In addition , incorporation of interlayer can alter charge collection and selectivity by modifying the Fermi level alignment to either the E F,h of the donor or the E F,e of the acceptor for hole and electron transportation , respectively. Therefore , the altered polarity of electrodes by insertion of proper interlayer can result in two types of PSCs structures : conventional and inverted structures. 2f The inverted device with reversed polarity of electrodes , consisting of bottom indium tin oxide ( ITO ) as cathode and top high work function ( WF ) metal as anode , is an advantageous approach for practical commercialization of PSCs due to its superior long - term stability.",

    "sentence": "3 For the energy barrier caused by high work function of bare cathode ITO hinders the charge transportation and collection in inverted device ; an additional interlayer between light - harvesting active layer and ITO must be introduced to ensure proper energy level alignment and ohmic contact with lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) level of acceptor by lowering the work function of ITO. The built-in field created by interlayer modified ITO can efficiently surmount the barrier at ITO / active layer interface and promote charge collection at electrode. A variety of electron - transporting layer ( ETL ) materials for modifying ITO in inverted device have been explored. Solutionprocessed inorganic metal oxides ( such as CsCO 3 , TiO x , and ZnO , ) are extensively used as ETL materials for PSCs. 4 However , conversion of precursor to metal oxide requires high temperature annealing process and ambient conditions exposure , which is incompatible with printable devices based on flexible plastic substrates for commercial applications. 5 To evade the inherent weaknesses of inorganic material as ETL , organic interlayer materials , such as fullerene derivatives and conjugated polyelectrolytes ( CPEs ) , have been employed 6 due to their potentials for large area PSCs with roll - to - roll manufacturing techniques. As an interlayer , conjugated polyelectrolyte ( CPE ) affords remarkable performance improvement in many types of optoelectronic devices such as PLEDs , PSCs , and OFETs. 6j,7 Efficient electron injection / collection can be obtained by formation of strong interfacial dipole moments at cathode , which has been speculated as a result of a spontaneous orientation of the ionized groups. 2i,8 However , the substantial microscopic behavior of ion orientation remains ambiguous at the moment. In this work , we report the manipulation of the interfacial dipole orientation of a cationic CPE poly [3-(6trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophene] ( PTNBr ) in inverted PSCs by introduction of ionic liquid crystal (ILC)a material fusing the properties of water / alcohol miscibility and selforganization together. 9 Mixing CPE with the ionic liquid (IL)like ILC forms a stable CPE - ILC complex via electrostatic attraction between these two materials with opposite charge. 10 Meanwhile , LC - assistant electrostatic assembly can improve the orientation of dipole moments at cathode interface , which significantly reduces the work function of ITO. Compared with pure PTNBr CPE as ETL , CPE - ILC complex increases the efficiency of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C 61butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 60 BM ) based inverted PSCs by 37% . Replacing the active layer by low - bandgap donor poly(4,8-bis ( 5-(2-ethylhexyl) 11 and acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) , a higher efficiency of 7.49% can be achieved. It is worthy to note that ILC group can produce the rapid orientation of electric field - induced dipoles , and the V OC can be precisely manipulated by applied external electric field.",

In order to avoid generation of free salts during the assembly process , 13 we introduced a zwitterionic ILC 3-((2′-(4″-cyano-biphenyl-4yloxy)ethyl)dimethylammonio)propanesulfonate ( CbpNSO ) to study properties of the CPE - ILC complex. The zwitterionic materials ( polymers and small molecules ) had been used for interlayer in PSCs. 14 The synthetic route of the ILC is shown in Scheme S1 and the Experimental Section. The material purity , functionalization , and liquid crystal property were fully characterized ( Figures S1-S4 ). The cationic group in CPE and anionic group in ILC not only endow the resulting materials with good solubility in environmental friendly solvent but also derive an electrostatic assembly between them by blending these two materials. For comparison , a zwitterionic surfactant ( 3-(N,N-dimethyloctylammonio)propanesulfonate inner salt ( ZW ) with the same ionic groups to the ILC was also blended with PTNBr to afford a type of CPE - surfactant ( CPE-S ) with the aim to study effect of the liquid crystal groups of ILC on the properties ( Scheme S2 ). Both CPE - ILC and CPE-S complex maintain good solubility in alcohol and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ). Figure 2a demonstrates the UV - vis absorption spectra of CPE , CPE - ILC , and CPE-S complexes. All the complexes have similar absorption spectra in the isopropanol : water mixed solution , indicating that the electrostatic assembly between CPE and ILC or surfactant hardly affect the optical properties of the PTNBr in this free dispersed solution state. However , in the solid state , both CPE - ILC and CPE-S films display redshifted absorption bands with respect to the CPE film. Combination of surfactant into PTNBr results in a more ordered backbone of polymer ; thus , the PTNBr-ZW complex film gives a ∼ 30 nm red - shift compared with the PTNBr film. When the counterpart with orientational LC group is introduced , PTNBr - CbpNSO presents a nearly 90 nm redshift compared with PTNBr , suggesting the well - assembled packing of CPE - ILC induced by the LC group. A similar optical behavior can also be observed in PL spectra in Figure 2b. In order to remove the solvent effect , the complexes were dissolved in the low volatile solvent DMSO for optical measurement. From the Figure S5 , PTNBr - CbpNSO in DMSO achieves the same results in alcohol , indicating the increased π-electronic delocalization in the better arranged complex is definitely from the orientation of LC groups.",

    "sentence": "In addition , the absorption peak of the PTNBr - CbpNSO complex can achieve a further ∼ 10 nm red - shift after annealing the film from the mesophase states at 150 °C ( Figure S6 ). This reveals that liquid crystalline state annealing strengths spontaneous orientation property of LC to favor a more ordered assembly of CPE - ILC. The self - assembled structure formed by the CPE - ILC complex can be directly seen in the atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images shown in Figure 3 and Figure S7. The complex was spuncoated on ITO substrate and then annealed in the mesophase region. The thicknesses for these films are approximately 20 nm. The pure PTNBr provide a wave like film ( rms = 1.0 nm ). As shown in Figure 3 , the CbpNSO with zwitterionic side chain smoothes the morphology of PTNBr - CbpNSO with reduced rms of 0.5 nm. This phenomenon can be interpreted that PTNBr - CbpNSO with zwitterionic LC as a complexing agent can favor more ordered structures. Moreover , the electrostaticpairing effect between the two components can be evidenced in the phase images. The inner assembly morphology of the complex was also conducted by TEM. Different from homogeneous PTNBr , the PTNBr - CbpNSO complex forms elongated rodlike aggregates , verifying that cooperation assembly of CPE and ILC can generate rigid self - organized associations , 15 which may form long-range-ordered multilayers 15a , 16 and promote the efficient charge transport. To investigate the effect of this self - assembly between CPE and ILC on the energy level at metal / organic material interface , the Kelvin probe method was employed to directly measure the WF of the CPE , CPE-S , and CPE - ILC modified ITO electrode. 17 Figure 4 shows the WF images of the 10 nm thick CPE - ILC coated ITO after annealing from the liquid crystalline state for 10 min. The bare ITO exhibits a typical WF value of 4.93 ± 0.12 eV , in a good agreement with the literature. 2f The interfacial dipole formation at ITO / CPE interface leads to a reduction of WF by 0.4 eV after deposition of PTNBr on ITO , which can lower the Schottky barrier that is found to hamper the efficient electrons collection from the photoharvest layer to ITO at the ITO / PC 60 BM interface. 18 Replacing the pure PTNBr to the PTNBr-ZW complex with ZW surfactant , WF decreases to 4.40 eV. Although the electron transport to electrode is more favorable , the WFs of the PTNBr-ZW modified ITO are not low enough with respective to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of PC 60 BM ( 4.3 eV ) , and a Schottky contact still exists ( Figure 4 ).",

    "sentence": "Delightfully , the dipole moments of PTNBr - CbpNSO complexes lower the WFs to 4.02 ± 0.10 eV. A vacuum level shift of about 0.9 eV makes a substantial change in the work function of ITO , which sufficiently eliminates the barrier and forms an ohmic contact. Figures 1 and 3 demonstrate the probable mechanism for the decreased WF. The permanent dipole caused by the orientation of CPE at the ITO / polymer interface is the major reason for the WF shift in metal electrode surface. 17,19 The small - angle Xray scattering ( SAXS ) indicates the existence of ordered orientation in PTNBr film ( see Figure 4 ). The intensity of the scattering peak at ∼ 6.5 nm is increased by introducing these counterparts into polymer. The scattering of the pure PTNBr reveals a relatively weak peak at q ∼ 0.10 Å -1 , corresponding to a Bragg distance of about 6.0 nm. Upon addition of CbpNSO , the strong and sharp peaks with a d-space of ∼ 6.9 nm are observed , indicating the improved crystallinity of the film. Since the dipole is determined by the ionic chain orientation , the highly crystalline CPE - ILC film with ordered polar chains is preferable to form an aligned dipole moment. However , the pure PTNBr shows a relatively disordered dipole direction. As shown in Figure 4 , the alignment of ionized chains in the complex could form a dipole pointing away from ITO , ultimately resulting in the shifting of WF. The relationship between the ordering of CPE and magnitude of dipole is similar to the property of ferroelectric interlayer. 20 The WF reduction caused by enhanced orientation of dipole moment also increases the built-in field to break the electrical symmetry inside of the PSCs , consequently anticipating a V OC and J SC improvement. 21 The inverted PSCs based on these complexes were fabricated with the configuration of ITO / ETL / P3HT : PCBM / PE - DOT : PSS / Ag shown in Scheme S2. The CPE - ILC ( surfactant ) complex was deposited on ITO as a cathode interface modification layer. The transmittances of the ITO / CPE - ILC ( surfactant ) cathodes are almost identical to that of the bare ITO cathode , inferring that this ETL would not hinder the light - harvesting in the active layer ( Figure S8 ). Figure 4 presents the current density versus voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the inverted PSCs based on P3HT : PC 60 BM. Both complexes were optimized at the ultrathin thickness of 5-10 nm , enabling \" quantum tunneling \" for charge transport from the active layer to the ITO cathode ( Figure S9 and Table S1 ). 17 The device performance parameters are summarized in Table 1.",

    "sentence": "As shown in Figure 4 and Figure S10 , in comparison with the standard PSCs with pure PTNBr ETL exhibiting a relatively low PCE of 2.91% , the performance of the device using the PTNBr - CbpNSO ETL is dramatically improved with the average PCE approaching to 4.0% , giving 285% and 22% improvement over the two reference device with bare ITO and ITO / ZnO cathodes , respectively. The improved PCE of devices with CPE - ILC is the result of enhanced J SC and slightly improved V OC relative to the devices with pure PTNBr , suggesting the more favorable charge injection and collection are achieved at electrodes. In contrast , the devices based on PTNBr-ZW give the comparable performance just with slightly enhanced J SC to the standard PSC with pure PTNBr ETL. As a comparison , pure ILC ( surfactant ) was also used to modify the ITO cathode. As shown in Figure S11 and Table S2 , the highest PCE among these devices is below 3% , which is blamed on the low fill factor values ( less than 50% ) caused by the poor quality of these films. It can be concluded that only the LC favored electrostatic assembly with the PTNBr can promote the highly orientated dipole moment along with the induced built-in electric field , consequently enhancing the device performance. The similar results can be found in the devices with complex layer spin - coated from their DMSO solution ( see Figure S12 and Table S3 ). The improvement in these parameters can be mainly attributed to the enhanced orientation of dipole moment pointing out from ITO penetrating into the BHJ layer through the swift down of the vacuum level of the ITO cathode. 22 To further confirm the orientation dipole moment caused by the LC favored electrostatic assembly and testify the universality of CPE - ILC on common PSCs , inverted PSCs based on the lowbandgap polymer PBDTTT-C-T with these ETLs were fabricated by the ITO / ETL / PBDTTT-C-T : PC 70 BM / PE - DOT : PSS / Ag structure. As expected , the average efficiency of the devices can be improved greatly from 6.28% for pure PTNBr to 7.41% for PTNBr - CbpNSO with enhanced J SC and slightly improved V OC ( Table 2 and Figure S13 ). Incorporation of the ILC into CPE layer is found to reduce the magnitude of the saturated dark current by 1 order , as shown in Figure S13. In comparison with the device based on ZnO ETL showing J SC of 14.3 mA / cm^2 , the PTNBr - CbpNSO based PSC achieves the J SC of 16.4 mA / cm^2 with an increase of 15% .",

    "sentence": "The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) values of the devices with PTNBr- CbpNSO complex are much higher than those standard devices without ILC , which is in agreement with the high value of J SC ( there are only less than 4% error between the calculated J SC value from the EQE and the J SC from J-V curves ; see Figure S13 and Table 2 ). The response enhancement of the EQE value at 300-400 nm when incorporation of CPE - ILC into this device is in accordance with the absorbance spectra of device ( see Figure S14 ). With the help of CPE - ILC , the PBDTTT-C-T : PC 70 BM - based inverted PSCs affords a top PCE of 7.49% , which approaches the reported performance of the conventional PSC with the low WF Ca / Al cathode. 11 The built-in electric field in the BHJ layer induced by the CPE - ILC complex is expected to facilitate the exciton dissociation and increase the photogenerated - carrier collection. 22a In order to evaluate the apparent charge carrier mobility in the active layer , J 0.5 -V characteristics of single charge carrier devices were measured using the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) model according to the Mott - Gurney equation ( detail of the mobility measurement is described in the Supporting Information ). 23 As plotted in Figure 5 , with respect to the device without ETLs , device with PTNBr ensures the apparent electron mobility and hole mobility increase from 1.33 × 10^-3 to 2.13 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and from 1.46 × 10^-4 to 3.13 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 at an applied voltage of 1 V , respectively. After insertion of PTNBr - CbpNSO , further improvements in the electron mobility ( 4.10 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) and hole mobility ( 5.07 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) are detected. The results reveal that the cooperation assembly between ILC and CPE can improve both electron and hole mobility of device with a more balanced charge transport. 24 A relative thick interlayer is helpful for the charge mobility and the maximum with thickness reaches to ∼ 20 nm , owing to the produced stronger built-in field in the BHJ layer ( Figure S15 ). However , too thick interlayer always increases the contact resistance to reduce device efficiency. 25 Thus , the device with appropriate CPE - ILC interlayer thickness in the range of 5-10 nm would balance the charge transport and resistance in the PSCs. The orientation of ILC that induces formation of a favorable dipole will be very sensitive to the internal electric field afforded by the inherent WF difference between two electrodes 22a due to the intrinsic response of the liquid crystals to the stimulations. To investigate the effect of the electric field on the dipole orientation , we applied positive and negative electric field to manipulate the dipole moment of the CPE - ILC interlayer in PSCs.",

The thermal effect on the device performance can be excluded because it is found that only a slight loss of V OC ( less than 4 mV ) and J SC ( less than 0.2 mA ) is observed for this device after heated at 70 °C for 6 h without applying bias ( Figure S16 ). First , a negative bias is applied from -5 to -15 V. As the negative bias increases , the V OC of device improves from 0.570 to 0.626 V along with decrease of J SC from 11.7 to 10.3 mA / cm^2 ( Figure 6a , defined as process 1 ). Further elevating the bias voltage to -20 V leads to the breakdown of the devices. On the contrary , applying positive bias voltage on the device provides an opposite result , that is , a gradually decreased V OC with the minimum value of 0.471 V upon + 15 V bias , as displayed in Figure 6b ( defined as process 2 ). Similarly , the J SC still shows reduced value in process 2. The current produced by the bias voltages may pose deterioration on the arrangement and phase separation in BHJ layer ; therefore , the J SC decreases with the bias voltages increasing no matter the direction of bias. This phenomenon is accordance with the reported fluoroalkylated organic semiconductors in PSCs. 8a The voltage change in photovoltaic devices can also be reflected by the saturated dark current of the device. 26 As plotted in Figure 6c , the negative bias voltage reduces the reverse saturated dark current and increases the turn-on voltage for the diode , ascribed to the enhanced reverse carrier - injection barrier that is beneficial to prevent the charge recombination , whereas applying positive bias voltage draws diametrically opposite conclusion. The correlation of the saturated dark current and the V OC in the device can be expressed by the Shockley equation 27 = + - - + - ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎫ ⎬ ⎭ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ J R R J V JR nkT e V R J 1^1 / exp / 1 s sh 0 sh ph ( 1 ) where J is the current density , V is the applied bias , J ph is the photocurrent density due to exciton dissociation , R sh is the shunt resistance , R s is the series resistance , n is the ideality factor , k is the Boltzmann constant , T is the absolute temperature , e is the elementary charge , and J 0 is the reverse saturation current density.",

Therefore , the difference in J 0 of the devices with two opposite bias voltage leads to the increase or decrease of V OC . The diametrically opposite behavior of V OC caused by two opposite bias voltages should be related to the changes in the orientation of dipole moments manipulated by electric field which can be elucidated by Figure 7. For the inverted device ( Figure 7 , middle ) , a built-in electric field pointing from ITO to Ag activates a favorable dipole pointing away from ITO in ETL. When applying negative voltage pulse ( Figure 7 , left ) with the same direction to built-in electric field , a dipole moment will be strengthen with more aligned favorable orientation for better energy alignment. On the contrary , the positively poled electric field led to some unfavorable dipole moment pointing toward ITO with reversed direction ( Figure 7 , right ) , which would weaken the built-in electric field and subsequently result in the loss in V OC . These results reveal that the spontaneously formed dipole at cathode in devices with CPE - ILC ETL can be promoted or eliminated by the applied electric field. For comparison , three control devices based on ETL of ZnO , PTNBr , and PTNBr-ZW with the same applied bias voltage were also investigated. Figure 8 summarizes the V OC and J SC changes in all devices , and Figures S17 - S19 exhibit the J-V characteristics of those control devices after applying different bias voltages. Similar with the case of PTNBr - CbpNSO , the applied bias voltages decline the J SC of all the devices. The V OC of the device with the ITO / ZnO cathode remains almost unchanged after applying negative or positive bias voltages ( Figure S17 ) , but V OC of the devices with ITO / PTNBr and ITO / PTNBr-ZW both vary with bias voltage ( Figures S18 and S19 ). However , the changes of V OC in these control devices were not as sharp as those in the devices with the ITO / PTNBr - CbpNSO cathode.",

It can be inferred that the significant V OC variation of the PTNBr - CbpNSO based device induced by bias voltage definitely comes from the CbpNSO group. For the device with pure PTNBr and PTNBr-ZW interlayer , the orientation of the dipoles can only be slightly changed by the constant bias voltage , limited to the slow movement of the ionized group. Liquid crystals possess rapid response to external stimulation , such as light , electric , and magnetic fields. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal , the liquid crystal molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field. Thus , the CbpNSO mesogenic group can reduce orientation energy barrier and activate the dipoles of PTNBr - CbpNSO , which produces rapid rearrangement of dipoles align with the electric field. Such amplified electric - field - induced dipole orientation also offer an opportunity to precisely manipulate the energy alignment at the electrode interface. Intriguingly , due to the rapid orientation of electric - fieldinduced dipole , PTNBr - CbpNSO can generate reversible dipole at the active layer / ITO interface undergoing reversible bias process. From Figure 9 we can notice that , when an applied negative bias from -5 to -15 V ( process 1 ) followed by performing the opposite bias from + 5 to + 15 V on devices ( process 3 ) , V OC of the devices increases to 0.626 V at first and then goes back to 0.519 V. The reversibility of V OC can also be clearly depicted in Figure 9. The similar behavior can be observed when the applied bias with the reversed sequence and a circle of V OC is nearly formed by applying process 2 followed by process 4 ( Figure 9 ). The reversible V OC implies the reversible dipole moments at the active layer / ITO interface stimulated by the applied bias with different directions. Furthermore , upon the same positive bias , processes 2 and 3 show the comparable decrease of 100-110 mV in the V OC , while influences of processes 1 and 4 applied with negative bias on the V OC are quit different. Compared with 60 mV increase of V OC in process 1 , a sharp 117 mV enhancement is yielded in process 4. This difference of V OC between processes 1 and 4 with the same applied negative bias is ascribed to the applying sequence of negative and positive bias on the whole circle.",

( | E HOMO-donor | - |E LUMO - acceptor | ) / e - 0.3 ] , In conclusion , we have incorporated a zwitterionic LC molecule into the CPE to form an electrostatic self - assembled CPE - ILC complex as an ETL in inverted PSCs. This approach is much easier than the tuning of molecule structure through complicated synthesis. The UV and SAXS results manifest that the dual properties of IL - like electrostatic attraction with CPE and LC - like ordered arrangement dramatically improve the ordering and orientation of polymer. As a comparison , a CPE-S complex without mesogenic group exerts relatively inferior capability of self - assembly. The self - assembly achieved an alignment of the polarized side chains of CPE , enabling an orientation of dipole moment. Significant enhancement of PCE can be obtained by the ILC - induced spontaneous orientation of the ionized chain of CPE , along with 0.9 eV WF reduction of ITO. The PBDTTT-C-T : PC 70 BM - based PSCs with CPE - ILC interlayer as ETL achieved a best PCE of 7.49% . In addition , the dipole orientation in devices varied with the applied electric field , which is reflected in the change of V OC and diode behaviors. The electric - field - induced LC group can reduce the activation energy of molecular reorganization and accelerate dipole orientation in CPE interlayer. Therefore , a reversible dipole at the active layer / ITO interface can be produced during the reversible bias process. This methodology could provide a practical approach for investigating the relevance between PSCs performance and interfacial energy levels and thus obtaining some information about the behaviors of interlayer at PSCs interface .",

    "sentence": "An oxindole - based monomer , (Z)-3-(thiophen-2-yl-methylene)indolin-2-one ( TEI ) has been synthesized. The hemi-isoindigo , TEI was polymerized separately with bis-(trimethylstannyl) functionalized thiophene , bis(alkoxy)benzodithiophene , and bis(alkylthienyl)benzodithiophene to form polymers PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT , respectively. These new conjugated polymers showed lowlying HOMO energy levels ( -5.26 to -5.42 eV ) , suitable LUMO energy levels ( -3.63 to -3.66 eV ) , strong absorption in visible region and extended to near - IR. The inverted bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells based on the new polymers were fabricated and tested. The solar cell devices based on the blend of PTEI-T:[6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) achieved a short - circuit current density ( J sc ) value of 13.4 mA cm^-2 , a fill factor ( FF ) of 0.65 , an open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.85 V , and a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 7.32% . The high performance solar cell devices were realized with the polymer which had a relatively simple structure . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) are potentially low cost , lightweight and compatibility with large scale solution processing. 1,2 They have been considered as an important part of renewable energy in the future. Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells are based on the blend of electron - donating conjugated polymers and electron - accepting fullerene derivatives such as PCBMs. 2 Recently , significant progresses have been made in both material syntheses and solar cell device fabrications. The power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of BHJ PSC devices have reached 8-10 % . 3-8 However , many high performance polymers for PSC applications have complicated structures. Arduous synthesis and expensive intermediates are frequently involved for obtaining small amount of materials. These difficulties may restrict or even prohibit the practical applications of some high performance materials. Therefore , the development of new polymers for highly efficient PSCs from readily available materials and concise chemical synthesis is still a big challenge. Isoindigo and expanded isoindigo are bis(oxindole) - containing compounds. They have become increasingly important as electron - deficient building blocks for donor / acceptor , low bandgap conjugated polymers. 9-12 The common features of indigoid polymers include low - lying frontier orbital energy levels , strongly absorbing in visible region , and good solubility after N-alkylation. 13,14 Some high - performance BHJ PSC devices with indigoid polymers as electron donors have been reported recently. 15-20 (Z)-3-(Thiophen-2-yl-methylene)indolin-2-one ( TEI ) is a 2-thienylmethylene derivative of oxindole. Unlike bis(oxindole) monomers , the TEI is an unsymmetrical monomer. The related 3-benzylidene and hetarylmethylene derivatives of oxindole have been synthesized and studied for the treatment of neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease recently. 21 However , a monooxindole-or hemiisoindigo - based structure has never been studied as a building block for conjugated polymers. Herein , we present the synthesis of TEI monomer and three new conjugated polymers based on this new building block.",

    "sentence": "The new polymers possess relatively low HOMO energy levels and broad absorption spectrum. The solar cell devices based on the TEI-thiophene polymer as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor achieved a PCE of 7.32% . Synthesis and Characterization of the Polymers. (Z)-6-Bromo-3-((5-bromothiophen-2-yl)methylene)indolin-2-one ( 1 ) was synthesized by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 6-bromooxindole and 5-bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde in the presence of piperidine ( Scheme1 ). Compound 1 showed poor solubility in common solvents such as acetone and ethyl ether. It was washed with methanol and ethyl acetate and was directly used in the next step. Compound 1 was N - alkylated with 9-(iodomethyl)nonadecane to give the monomer TEI , which was soluble in many organic solvents such as chloroform and acetone. The structure of the TEI was carefully studied by 1 NMR , 13 °C NMR and NOESY experiment ( Figures S1-S3 in Supporting Information ). The (Z)-isomer was confirmed as the only stereoisomer isolated in the condensation reaction. The assignment of stereostructure was consistent with some 1 H nuclear overhauser enhancement ( NOE ) study on the related compounds in the recent literature. 21,22 The monomer TEI was polymerized with bis(trimethylstannyl) functionalized thiophene ( T ) , bis(alkoxy)-BDT ( BDTO ) , and bis(alkylthienyl) - BDT ( BDTT ) monomers. The Stille cross-coupling polymerizations were carried out with a 1 : 1 monomer ratio in the presence of tris-(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium as catalyst , tri-o-tolylphosphine as ligand and toluene as solvent in Schlenk tubes at 65 °C . This reaction temperature was much lower than the temperature ( about 100 °C ) normally used for Stille crosscoupling reaction. We found that higher polymerization temperature could result insoluble product in this system. The reactions gave dark blue polymers. The crude polymers were purified by precipitating in methanol , washing with methanol and with hexane in Soxhlet extractors. The residues were extracted with hot chloroform and solvents were removed to give purified polymers. The polymer PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT showed good solubilities in solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. The new polymers were characterized by 1H NMR at elevated temperature ( Figures S5-S7 ) and by elemental analyses. The number - average molecular weights ( M n ) and polydispersity indexes ( PDIs ) of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using polystyrenes as standards and tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) as eluent. The results are listed in Table 1. The number - average molecular weights of PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT were 135.0 , 71.6 , and 24.4 kDa , respectively ; the polydispersity indexes of PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT were 1.3 , 2.0 , and 2.2 , respectively. The TEI is an unsymmetrical monomer. The Stille cross-coupling polymerizations of TEI and bis(trimethylstannyl) functionalized monomers likely give polymers with regiorandom main chains. These polymers could have different local dipole moment from polymers based on isoindigo.",

Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) measurements were carried out to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymers. The results are listed in the Table 1 and the TGA graphs are displayed in Supporting Information ( Figure S8 ). The temperature of 5% weight - loss was chosen as the Optical and Electrochemical Properties. The UV - vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform ( CF ) solution and as thin films are shown in Figure 1. The optical properties of the polymers are summarized in Table 2. The absorption maximum ( λ max abs ) of PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO and PTEI - BDTT in chloroform were at 615 nm ( ε = 2.78 × 10^5 M -1 cm^-1 ) , 576 nm ( ε = 1.22 × 10^5 M -1 cm^-1 ) , and 581 nm ( ε = 1.75 × 10^5 M -1 cm^-1 ) , respectively. Two BDT - based polymers showed similar shapes of the absorption bands in solution. The solution absorption spectrum of PTEI - BDTT was slightly red - shifted compared with that of PTEI - BDTO. However , the thiophene based polymer PTEI-T showed different absorption characteric from two BDT - based polymers. The absorption band of PTEI-T was significantly red - shifted compared to those of PTEI - BDTO and PTEI - BDTT. The PTEI-T also showed much larger extinction coefficients than the BDT - based polymers in the range from 525 to 725 nm. These phenomena can be attributed to the degrees of delocalization in the conjugated polymers. The π-electrons in the fused aromatic units such as BDT were less favorable to delocalize into the polymer backbone than those in a single thiophene ring because the fused aromatic structures possess large resonance stabilization energy compared with a single thiophene ring. 23 The redshifted absorption band and strong absorption of PTEI-T were highly favorable for effective solar photon harvesting and might lead to high photocurrent in PSC devices. From solution to thin - film , the absorption bands became broad for all three polymers. The absorption onsets of the PTEI - BDTO and PTEI - BDTT thin - films were only slightly red - shifted compared with their solution absorption onsets. However , the absorption onset of PTEI-T showed significantly red - shifted ( 27 nm ) from solution to thin - film. This bathochromic shift indicated the existence of ordered aggregations and strong π-π stacking interactions between the PTEI-T polymers in solid - state. 24 The The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) levels of the polymers were calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymer thin - films in cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) experiments.

The electrochemical potentials were converted to the corresponding HOMO The onset oxidation potentials of PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT were at 0.62 , 0.55 , and 0.71 V , respectively. The corresponding HOMO energy levels of PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT were -5.33 , -5.26 , and -5.42 eV , respectively. The onset reduction potentials of PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT were at -1.06 , -1.05 , and -1.08 eV. The corresponding LUMO energy levels of PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT were -3.65 , -3.66 , and -3.63 eV , respectively. These new polymers possess relatively low HOMO energy levels for high open circuit voltage and suitable LUMO energy levels for charge separation. 27,28 Theoretical Calculations. The theoretical calculation using DFT ( B3LYP / 6-31G** level ) method was employed to study the electronic structures of these polymers. To simplify the calculations , long alkyl side chains were replaced by methyl groups. 29-31 The results are showed in Figure S9. It was found that the HOMOs of the polymers were distributed along the whole structures , while the LUMOs were localized at the TEI units. The dihedral angles between TEI and BDT were 11.86 ° i n TEI - BDTO and 9.92 ° in TEI - BDTT , while the dihedral angle between TEI and thiophene was 8.31 ° in TEI-T. The small dihedral angle in the TEI-T was beneficial for coplanarity of the polymer backbone and for interchain π-π stacking in solid state. Photovoltaic Properties of the Polymers. Polymer solar cell devices with polymer PTEI-T , PTEI - BDTO , and PTEI - BDTT as electron donors and PC61BM as electron acceptor were fabricated and tested ( Figure 3a , and Table 3 ). The device structure was ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC61BM / MoO 3 / Ag. The active layer was processed with chlorobenzene ( CB ) and the concentration of donor material was 10 mg mL -1 . Solar cells were characterized under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm^-2 from a Newport solar simulator. The PCEs of PTEI-T- , PTEI-BDTO- , and PTEI - BDTT - based solar cell devices with polymer / PC61BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) were 4.86 , 2.01 , and 3.05% , respectively. Processing additive , diiodooctane ( DIO ) was added to improve the morphology of the active layer.",

The PTEI-T based device achieved a short - circuit current density ( J sc ) value of 13.4 mA cm^-2 , a fill factor ( FF ) of 0.65 , and an open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.85 V to give a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 7.32% at weight ratio of PTEI-T to PC61BM of 1 : 1.5 and with addition of DIO ( 3% by volume ) as processing additive. The high performance solar cell devices were realized with the new polymer which had a relatively simple structure. The result demonstrated the great potential of TEI as a new building block for high performance photovoltaic polymers. The external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) of the devices were measured to gain better understanding on solar cell performances ( Figure 4 ). 33 The devices showed photo- Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) Morphology and Xray Diffraction ( XRD ) Analysis. The morphologies of PTEI-T / PC61BM , PTEI - BDTO / PC61BM , and PTEI - BDTT / PC61BM thin - films processed with or without DIO were characterized by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to study the effect of the processing additive on the solar cell performances. 34-36 The AFM images were measured on the films which were spin - coated on top of ZnO - coated ITO from a blend solution of polymer : PC61BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) with or without DIO. The blend films showed large aggregations when spin - coated without DIO ( Figure 5a-c ). The large aggregations could result from the poor miscibility between donor polymers and PC61BM. The domain sizes were more than hundred nanometers. They were much larger than the scale of exciton diffusion. This could cause inefficient exciton dissociation. After addition of DIO ( 2% by volume ) , the aggregations in the blend films were suppressed and the domain sizes were significantly reduced ( Figure 5d-f ). The good miscibility and large interface area between the donor and acceptor were favorable for efficient exciton separation and charge transport which contributed to the enhancement of J sc and PCEs of PSCs. The AFM images of PTEI-T:PC61BM ( 1 : 1.5,w / w ) thin - film processed with DIO ( 3% by volume ) are displayed in Supporting Information ( Figure S10 ). X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) study on active layers was carried out. The samples were prepared by drop - casting the blend solutions of polymer : PC61BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) on silicon substrates.

They were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction of 2,5bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene and the corresponding monomers of 2,5-bis(5′-bromo-3′,4′-dihexylthien-2′-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole or 2,5-bis(5′-bromo-3′,4′-dihexylthien-2′-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole , respectively. The experimental results indicated that the introduction of an electron - accepting moiety of OXD or TD lowered the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy levels , resulting in the higher the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) values of polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). Indeed , the PSCs of P1 and P2 showed high V oc values in the range 0.80 - 0.90 V. The highest field - effect transistor ( FET ) mobilities of P1 and P2 with the OXD and TD moieties , respectively , were 1.41 × 10^-3 and 8.81 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The higher mobility of P2 was related to its orderly nanofibrillar structure , as evidenced from the TEM images. Moreover , the higher absorption coefficient and smaller band gap of P2 provided a more efficient light - harvesting ability. The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSC based on P2 : PCBM = 1 : 1 ( w / w ) reached 3.04% with a short - circuit current density ( J sc ) value of 6.60 mA / cm^2 , a V oc value of 0.80 V , and a fill factor ( FF ) value of 0.576 during the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2. In comparison , the parent PDHBT without the electron - accepting moiety exhibited an inferior device performance ( FET mobility = 2.10 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and PCE = 1.91% ). The experimental results demonstrated that incorporating the electron - acceptor moiety into the polythiophene backbone could enhance the device performance due to the low - lying HOMO levels , compact packing structure , and high charge carrier mobility. This is the first report for the achievement of PCE > 3% using PSCs based on polythiophenes having TD units in the main chain . Bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , in which the photoactive layer consists of an interpenetrating network of a π-conjugated polymer donor ( D ) and a soluble fullerene acceptor ( A ) , have attracted much attention because of their easy processability , low material costs , high efficiency , and mechanical flexibility. 1-14 One of the most successful system until now utilizes a blend of regioregular poly(3hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) and [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) as the active layer , normally giving power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) in the range of 4-5 % .",

    "sentence": "2,6,7 However , the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level of P3HT is too high ( ca. -4.76 eV 15 ) which limits the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) values of the PSCs to ca. 0.6 V. It is well - known that the modulation of the HOMO / lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels for the polymers is essential to realize a high V oc value without sacrificing the broad light harvesting and efficient charge separation , which correspond to a J sc value. 16 Donor - acceptor ( D-A ) polymers are attractive as p - type materials for PSCs due to the facile tunability of the HOMO / LUMO energy levels by properly choosing the D and A moieties. Indeed , much effort has been made to achieve very high PCEs over 7% for the PSC devices. 17-22 1,3,4-Oxadiazole ( OXD ) and 1,3,4-thiadiazole ( TD ) are electron - deficient units containing two electron - withdrawing imine groups ( CN ) and can be used as A units. For instance , a structure similar to the benzothiadiazole units has frequently been utilized as an A unit in D-A polymers to achieve high PCEs. 23-28 However , a few reports have described the PSCs using D-A type polymers bearing OXD and TD units , 29,30 regardless of their electron - withdrawing nature , as well as more compact structures compared to the benzothiadiazole units , which would be preferable for more densely packed structures for the polymer films to induce a high charge mobility. We now report the synthesis of new D-A type polythiophene derivatives carrying OXD or TD units , i.e. , P1 and P2 ( see Figure 1 ) , based on the Stille coupling reaction of 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene and the corresponding monomers of 2,5-bis(5′-bromo-3′,4′-dihexylthien-2′-yl)-1,3,4oxadiazole ( 5 ) or 2,5-bis(5′-bromo-3′,4′-dihexylthien-2′-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole ( 7 ) , respectively ( see Scheme 1 ). The D-A polymers are soluble in common organic solvents and their chemical structures , molecular weight , thermal stability , optical and electronic properties , morphology , FET , and photovoltaic characteristics were fully investigated. The parent polymer , poly ( 3,4-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene ) ( PDHBT ) , without the OXD or TD moiety was prepared in order to compare the properties of P1 and P2. In particular , P1 and P2 show HOMO levels of -5.55 and -5.33 eV , respectively , which are lower than that of PDHBT as expected. The BHJ PSC based on P2 : PCBM = 1 : 1 ( w / w ) exhibits PCEs up to 3.04% with the high V oc value of 0.80 V under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2 , which is the first example of the TD - containing D-A polymers showing such a high PCE over 3% . Synthesis of Polymers. The general synthetic strategy for the monomers and polymers is outlined in Scheme 1.",

    "sentence": "The alternative D-A type copolymers , P1 and P2 , were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction of 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene with 5 or 7 , respectively. Since a decrease in the solubility was expected by introducing the unsubstituted fivemembered ring of OXD and TD , the 3,4-dihexylthiophene units were incorporated. As a result , P1 and P2 were quite soluble in the common organic solvents such as THF , CHCl 3 , benzene , toluene , chlorobenzene , and o-dichlorobenzene. The number - average molecular weights and polydispersity indices ( M n , PDI ) of P1 and P2 determined by SEC in CHCl 3 with a calibration using polystyrene standards are ( 18^500 , 1.45 ) and ( 24^400 , 1.88 ) , respectively , as listed in Table 1. The results indicated that P1 and P2 possess adequate molecular weights. The SEC curves of P1 and P2 are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. Figure 2 shows the 1H NMR spectra of P1 and P2. In both cases , characteristic signals appear assignable to the 3-and 4-protons of the unsubstituted thiophene ring at 7.22 ppm ( P1 ) and at 7.23 ppm ( P2 ). In addition , the signals assignable to the methylene protons next to the thiophene ring can also be seen at 3.05 and 2.81 ppm ( P1 ) and at 2.92 and 2.80 ppm ( P2 ) , the intensities of which are reasonably compared to the ones of the signals for the 3and 4-protons of the unsubstituted thiophene ring. Thus , the above results suggest the successful synthesis of the target polymers. The thermal stability of the two polymers was investigated by TGA , as shown in Figure S2. The onset decomposition temperatures of P1 and P2 for a 5% weight loss are 403 and 393 °C , respectively ( see also Table 1 ) , indicating that the thermal stability of the two polymers is sufficient for application in optoelectronic devices. Optical and Electrochemical Properties. The UV - vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chlorobenzene are depicted in Figure 3a , which show the maximum absorption wavelength ( λ max ) at 423 nm ( P1 ) , 467 nm ( P2 ) , and 446 nm ( PDHBT ) , respectively. In the film states , the λ max values of both polymers bathochromically shift to 470 nm ( P1 ) , 513 nm ( P2 ) , and 510 nm ( PDHBT ) , respectively , indicating the structure ordering in these films ( see Figure 3b ). P1 has the λ max value in the wavelength region shorter than P2 because of less crystalline nature , as will be described later. In additional , P1 has a lower λ max value than PDHBT. From the Gaussian simulation ( Figure S3 ) , the studied polymers show almost planar structures , which the torsional angles are generally smaller than 1.5 ° . The result indicates there is no obvious steric hindrance to affect energy band gaps.",

    "sentence": "Hence , P2 and PDHBT have smaller band gap than P1 , probably due to the sulfur element having a larger atomic radius , more effectively hybridizing s and p orbitals , and being more polarizable , which are favorable for intermolecular interactions in thin films. 35 The calculated optical band gap ( E g opt ) values of P1 and P2 from the onset wavelengths of 542 nm ( P1 , film state ) and 591 nm ( P2 , film state ) are 2.29 and 2.10 eV , respectively. These results are summarized in Table 2 , and they indicate that P2 absorbs light more efficiently compared to P1 , which would be more preferable for the PSC performance. Furthermore , the absorption coefficients of the thin films of P1 ( 1.78 × 10^5 cm^-1 at ca. 470 nm ) , P2 ( 2.03 × 10^5 cm^-1 at ca. 513 nm ) , and PDHBT ( 1.89 × 10^5 cm^-1 at ca. 510 nm ) are comparable to that of the P3HT film ( 1.9 × 10^5 cm^-1 at ca. 552 nm ). 36 Also , by incorporating the TD electron acceptor into polymer main chain , P2 shows a higher absorption coefficient than PDHBT. The high absorption coefficient of P2 suggests its potential to enhance the PSC characteristics. The electrochemical CV ( Figure 4 ) of P1 and P2 was performed in acetonitrile at a potential scan rate of 0.1 V / s for determining their HOMO energy levels. The CV curves of the P1 and P2 films show the oxidation peaks with the onset 4 ). Note that the HOMO energy level is estimated using the following relation : HOMO = -e(E ox ( onset ) - E 1 / 2 ( ferrocene ) + 4.8 ) ( eV ). 37 It was found that both polymers possess lower HOMO energy levels than P3HT ( -4.88 eV as measured under the same conditions ) and PDHBT ( -5.22 eV 32 ) , which should be consistent with the high V oc values from the PSC characterization , as described below. The LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were determined to be -3.26 and -3.23 eV , respectively , by the calculation of LUMO = HOMO + E g opt . All the CV data are also summarized in Table 2. Morphological Characterization. DSC was used to investigate the possible crystallization of the prepared polymers. As shown in Figure 5 , there are distinct endothermic peaks for the T m values at 174 °C ( P1 ) and 217 °C ( P2 ) and corresponding exothermic peaks for the T c values at 140 °C ( P1 ) and 197 °C ( P2 ) , respectively , as listed in Table 1. It is obvious that P2 exhibits more distinct transition peaks than P1 , which may be caused by highly ordered packing structures. These data are summarized in Table 1.

    "sentence": "The annealed P2 thin film shows a distinct organized nanofibrillar structure as compared to P1. The well - ordered nanofibrillar morphology of P2 could result in good charge carrier transporting characteristics. The GIXD analyses of the P1 and P2 thin films ( thickness of 40-50 nm ) were carried out to further investigate their structural ordering , as shown in Figure 7. Although the P1 film without annealing does not show a distinct diffraction peak except for the amorphous halo around 2θ = 21 ° , a new diffraction peak appeared at 2θ = 4.6 ° , corresponding to the d 1 spacing value of 19.2 Å after annealing at 100 ° C. In contrast , the P2 film exhibited a distinct diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.3 ° , corresponding to the d 1 spacing value of 20.5 Å without annealing. In addition , after annealing at 100 °C , the d 1 spacing value decreased to 18.4 Å , indicating more compact packing structures. Moreover , as compared to PDHBT ( Figure S4 ) , the studied polymers exhibit the smaller d 1 spacing ( P1 ( 19.2 Å ) and P2 ( 18.4 Å ) ) than PDHBT ( 24.5 Å ) after annealing. This result may be due to the acceptor moieties incorporated into the polymer backbone that enhances the D-A intramolecular charge transfer. All the results supported the fact that P2 shows the highest degree of crystalline nature , which well agrees with the optical property Besides , the nanofibrillar morphology of P2 is also observed in the tapping mode AFM phase images ( Figure S5 ). The ordered nanofibrillar structure of the P2 film with the interconnected networks of the polymer chains may allow the formation of highly efficient pathways for charge carrier transport. 38,39 Field Effect Transistor ( FET ) Characteristics. Solutionprocessed FETs based on P1 , P2 , and PDHBT were fabricated from chlorobenzene. All the FET devices were fabricated by employing a top - contact configuration for reducing the contact resistance. Figure 8 shows the FET transfer curves and output characteristics of the copolymer devices on the ODTS - modified SiO 2 . In the saturation region ( V d > V g - V t ) , I d can be described by the equation 40 μ = - I WC L V V 2 ( ) ds 0 g t 2 where W and L are the channel width and length , respectively , C 0 is the capacitance of the gate insulator per unit area ( SiO 2 , 300 nm , C 0 = 10 nF / cm^2 ) , μ is the hole mobility , and V t is the threshold voltage. The saturation - regime mobility was estimated from the slope of the plot of the drain - to - source current ( I d ) 1 / 2 as a function of the gate voltage ( V g ).",

    "sentence": "FET devices based on the polymer films were processed with and without annealing at 100 ° C. The corresponding carrier mobilities are listed in Table 3 , and the typical p - type transfer and output characteristics of the studied polymers are shown in Figure 8 and Figure S6. The average FET hole mobility ( μ ) value of P1 was determined to be 1.66 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 without annealing and increased to 1.41 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 after annealing with the high ON / OFF ratio of 7.8 × 10^5 . In contrast , P2 shows much higher average μ values of 4.82 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( without annealing ) and 8.81 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( after annealing ) than P1 , with an adequate ON / OFF ratio. For comparison , PDHBT without the electron - accepting OXD or TD moiety shows a μ value of 2.10 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 after annealing ( Figure S6 ) , which is in good agreement with the value in the literature 33 and is lower than that of either P1 or P2. This result indicated that the incorporation of the electronacceptor moieties efficiently enhances the charge transport due to the D-A intramolecular charge transfer as well as the compact packing structure , as demonstrated by the GIXD characteristics. In addition , all the studied polymers showed higher mobility after thermal annealing because of the molecular packing was enhanced as evidenced by GIXD results. In particular , the maximum mobility of P2 after annealing reached 0.12 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( average : 8.81 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) , which is comparable to that of P3HT. These results are correlated with the more crystalline and ordered nanofibrillar morphology of P2 than either P1 or PDHBT , as previously described. The high threshold voltage of P1 probably comes from its very low HOMO energy levels ( -5.55 eV ) , leading to a high energy barrier for hole injection. Polymer Solar Cell Characteristics. The structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 30 nm ) / polymer : PCBM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) / Ca ( 30 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ) was fabricated for the PSC characterization under the AM 1.5 G illumination condition ( 100 mW cm^-2 ). The active layers of the studied devices were prepared through nonannealing or thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The J-V curves of the polymer / PCBM BHJ PSC devices were measured under an ambient condition after encapsulating them using glass covers and UV - curing glue , as shown in Figure 9. The PSC characteristics , including the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) , of the P1 , P2 , and PDHBT devices are summarized in Table 4.",

    "sentence": "For P1 , the high V oc values ( 0.81 - 0.90 V ) are attributed to their low HOMO energy levels ; however , the J sc values are very low at less than 1 mA / cm^2 , resulting in the low PCE of 0.28% . This is because P1 inefficiently absorbs light and its hole mobility is lower than P2 , derived from less ordered packing structures that prevents separated charge generation and smooth charge transportation. Unfortunately , changing the film thickness as well as the annealing process does not improve PCE. In a sharp contrast , P2 shows much improved J sc values of 4.57 - 6.60 mA / cm^2 , while maintaining the high V oc values ( 0.80 - 0.86 V ) due to efficient light harvesting , high hole mobility , and low HOMO energy levels. As a result , the highest PCE ( 3.04% ) could be achieved with a V oc value of 0.80 V , a J sc value of 6.60 mA / cm^2 , and a FF value of 0.576 after optimization of the solvent and spin rate for casting the polymers ( see Figure 9 ). It should be mentioned that the value of 0.80 V of V oc and the value of 6.60 mA / cm^2 of J sc of P2 are higher than those of the PDHBT : PCBM BHJ PSC devices due to its low - lying HOMO levels and high field - effect hole mobility , leading to a higher PCE for P2 ( 3.04% ) than for PDHBT ( 1.91% ). These results demonstrate that the incorporation of the TD acceptor units into the thiophenebased polymer main chain lowers the HOMO energy levels as well as enhances the charge transporting to achieve a high PCE of the devices. Furthermore , the PCE of over 3% is the first observation using TD - incorporated π-conjugated polymers in PSC applications. However , the annealing process decreases the PCE of P2 , even though the hole mobility increases after annealing as previously described. There is no clear explanation for this result at the present time , but the morphological change , such as aggregation , might occur after annealing , which generally causes a reduction in the interface areas of the p - type and n - type domains to limit the charge separation. Figure 10 shows the photocurrent action spectra of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 30 nm ) / polymer : PCBM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) / Ca ( 30 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ) devices , in which P1 , P2 , and PDHBT ( reference ) are compared. All the devices exhibited a relatively broad photoresponse between 300 and 620 nm ( 300-550 nm for P1 ) , indicating that the absorption of the polymer : PCBM blends reflects the photocurrents in these wavelength regions.",

The FET and PSC characteristics of P1 and P2 were investigated to determine the hole mobility and PCE , respectively.

The highest PCE ( 3.04% ) value among the TD - based polymers ever reported may be attributed to the high hole mobility of P2 ( 8.81 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ).

    "sentence": "Six novel conjugated copolymers ( P1-P6 ) containing coplanar cyclopentadithiophene ( CPDT ) units ( incorporated with bithiazole / thienyl-based monomers ) were synthesized and developed for the applications of polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). Copolymers P1-P6 covered broad absorption ranges from UV to near - infrared ( 400-800 nm ) with narrow optical band gaps of 1.70 - 1.94 eV , which are compatible with the maximum solar photon reflux. Partially reversible p-and n - doping processes of P1-P6 in electrochemical experiments were observed. Compared with those previously reported CPDT - based narrow band gap polymers , the proper molecular design for HOMO / LUMO levels of P1-P6 induced relatively high photovoltaic open - circuit voltages in the PSC devices. Powder X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) analyses suggested that these copolymers formed highly selfassembled π-π stackings. Under 100 mW / cm^2 of AM 1.5 white - light illumination , bulk heterojunction PSC devices containing an active layer of electron donor copolymers P1-P6 blended with electron acceptor [6,6]phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) in the weight ratio of 1 : 1 were explored , and the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) measurements showed a maximal quantum efficiency of 60% . The PSC device containing P4 in the weight ratio of 1 : 2 with PCBM gave the best preliminary result with an overall power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.04% , an open - circuit voltage of 0.70 V , a short - circuit current of 8.00 mA / cm^2 , and a fill factor of 53.7% . Extensive researches in the field of electro-optical devices have been focused on soluble π-conjugated semiconducting polymers , especially for the developments of organic photovoltaic ( OPV ) devices , which offer the advantages of lightweight , high - throughput , and environmentally renewable energy for future applications. Since the pioneering achievements of A. J. Heeger and co-workers in 1995 , 1 the so - called bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) concept has significantly improved the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) values of the OPV devices , where interpenetrating electron donor - acceptor ( D-A ) networks were formed by blending phaseseparated π-conjugated polymers ( as electron donors ) with soluble fullerenes , strong electron - affinity polymers , 2 or n - type nanocrystals 3 ( as electron acceptors ). For the electron - donating purpose , an increasing interest for novel polymeric materials with high charge carrier mobility and good processability has recently been found in thiophene - based conducting copolymers , such as derivatives of region - regular poly(3-hexylthiophene)s ( P3HTs ) , 4 polythiophenes , 5 and fused heterocyclic conjugated polymers , 6 etc. , resulting in OPV devices with the highest PCE value approaching 5.0% . Recently , in order to obtain longer conjugation lengths , more planar molecular geometries , and more rigid structures in π-conjugated polymers , 7 novel heteroaromatic fused - ring derivatives , including cyclopentadithiophene ( CPDT ) units , have been widely investigated in PSCs.",

    "sentence": "Kraak et al. first reported the structural unit of CPDT in 1968 , 8a and the later prepared CPDT - based polymers showed relatively high conductivities 8b,c,9a due to the more extensive π-conjugation lengths as compared with polythiophene and polyfluorene derivatives. 9 These enhanced photovoltaic properties of CPDT - based polymers have been found to be a powerful approach to optimizing the PSC performance , and thus to lower HOMO-LUMO band gaps and enable closer intermolecular interactions , resulting from the increases of coplanarities and longer conjugation lengths. Lately , the derivatives of cyclopentadithiophene - based copolymers have been emerged as very promising materials for OPV devices which possess both prominent properties of high carrier mobility 6c,10 and improved power conversion efficiency ( PCE ). 10b,11 Furthermore , a novel class of π-conjugated polymers composed of five - membered heteroaromatic rings with alkyl side chains , i.e. , poly(alkylbithiazole)s , have a strong tendency to self - assemble into stacked solid structures , and they exhibit interesting thermochromic and electrochemical behavior. 12,13,14b These conjugated polymers containing five - membered rings were considered to possess more coplanar structures and form more highly extended π-conjugated systems owing to their less sterically hindered structures compared with those containing six - membered rings. The thiazole unit is one of the strongest electron - accepting azaheterocycles because it contains one electron - withdrawing nitrogen of imine ( -CdN ) in place of the carbon atom at the 3-position of thiophene. Therefore , π-conjugated polymers incorporating with bithiazole ( BT ) moieties have been demonstrated to be as new n - type transporting materials. 12,13 However , only a limited number of bithiazolebased polymers have been explored , and their applications in PSC devices were quite rare. 14 The band - gaps along with the HOMO and LUMO levels of the conjugated polymers are finely tunable by copolymerization of different monomer units. 6a,14b,15 Another important observation was found that the electron - withdrawing cyano groups could decrease the HOMO level and thus to stabilize the neutral state of the conjugated system. 15 These results suggest that it is necessary to investigate the effects of copolymerized functional units on the optical , electrochemical , and PSC properties of the π-conjugated polymers. On the basis of this electron donor - acceptor ( D-A ) concept , six different bithiazole - based monomers , i.e. , oligo(bithiazole)s M1-M3 , bithiazole-oligo(thiophene)s M4-M5 , and diarylene-cyanovinylene-bithiazole M6 , were utilized as electron acceptor moieties to synthesize CPDT-BT - based copolymers P1 - P6. Therefore , our donor - acceptor approaches utilized in the solid films of the CPDT-BT - based copolymers ( P1-P6 ) achieve the absorption spectra in the visible range of 300-800 nm ( with tailing up to around 900 nm ) possessing narrow electrochemical band gaps of 1.51 - 1.83 eV.",

So far , the preliminary PSC performance of these structurally related copolymers showed the best PCE value up to 3.04% while blended with [6,6]-phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) , with a short circuit current density ( I sc ) of 8.00 mA / cm^2 , an open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.70 V , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 53.7% under AM 1.5 ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). SynthesisandChemicalCharacterization.Sixnewdonor - acceptor bithiazole - based ( BT ) monomers M1-M6 were prepared from 4,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiazole ( 1 ) 14a via Stille and Suzuki coupling reactions. By insertion of phenylene and cyanovinylene functionalities to BT units , oligo(bithiazole)s M1-M3 , and bithiazole-oligo(thiophene)s M4-M6 were obtained correspondingly , and their synthetic routes are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. Monomers M1-M6 and compound 14 were satisfactorily characterized by 1H NMR , 13 °C NMR , MS spectroscopy , and elemental analyses. As shown in Scheme 3 , further Stille coupling of bis-stannane 14 with monomers M1-M6 successfully resulted in the well - defined CPDT-BT copolymers P1 - P6. 6c,20 The attached pendants of two 2-ethylhexyl side chains on CPDT units and one long hexyl chain on bithiazole units were crucial to enhance the solubilities and the solution processabilities / tractabilities of these copolymers. All the copolymers were completely soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform , THF , and chlorobenzene at room temperature , except that copolymers P5 and P6 were only completely soluble in high boiling point solvents ( e.g. , chlorobenzene ). The less solubilities of copolymers P5 and P6 were likely owing to the higher rigidities of the polymer main chains caused by the larger number of thiophene units and rigid electron - withdrawing cyano groups. The yields and molecular weights of copolymers P1-P6 determined by GPC against polystyrene standards in THF are summarized in Table 1. After washing final products in Soxhlet apparatus , the yields of 15-65 % for P1-P6 were obtained. The copolymers have the number molecular weights ( M n ) of 5100 to 42100 with the polydispersity index ( PDI ) values ranging 1.08 - 1.81. The molecular weights of copolymers P5-P6 were relatively smaller than the other copolymers , which were likely due to the lower solubilities originated from the rigid thiophene and cyano groups.",

All copolymers were thermally stable up to 363-398 ° C upon heating and showed T g values over 120 °C , except that the phase transition temperatures of P1 and P6 were not observed by DSC. The detectable melting temperatures ( T m ) and crystallization temperatures ( T c ) of copolymers P4 and P5 suggested the higher ordering capabilities of P4 and P5 for their potential applications in organic solar cells , since the formation of phase - separated ordered nanostructures in the photovoltaic layer was desirable for charge transport and separation. 21,22 Optical properties. The optical absorption spectra of copolymers P1-P6 in chlorobenzene solutions ( 10^-6 M ) and solid films are shown in Figure 1. The photophysical properties of the D-A copolymers ( P1-P6 ) based on CPDT-BT units are illustrated in Table 2. As expected , by tuning the numbers of the conjugated heterocyclic rings and electron donor - acceptor compositions , the conjugation lengths of the copolymers will be affected , which will also influence the absorption spectra of P1-P6 effectively ( in both solutions and solid films ). For instance , due to the presence of a more extended and delocalized π-electron system by increasing the number of the donor thiophene ( Th ) ring , an obvious red - shifted absorption of copolymer P5 was observed compared with that of copolymer P4 in both solutions and solid films. Furthermore , copolymer P6 containing electron - accepting cyano groups showed the longest absorption wavelength among all copolymers in solu- tions. However , the numbers of BT acceptor units in copolymers P1-P3 affected the absorption maxima in solutions and solid films by different ways. Surprisingly , a blue - shifted absorption in solutions was observed by increasing the number of BT units in solutions of P1-P3 , which might be due to the twist of polymer main chains by the BT units with alkyl side - chains. Nevertheless , due to the enlarged full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) values from P1 to P3 , a blue - shifted absorption in solid films of P1-P3 was observed ; but their optical band gaps ( in solid films ) had been reduced from 1.94 eV of P1 to 1.83 eV of P3. Even though the numbers of the conjugated rings in both P2 and P4 or both P3 and P5 are the same , the electron donor ( Th ) and acceptor ( BT ) units still have some influences on copolymers P2 - P5.",

    "sentence": "Compared with copolymers P2 and P3 , the corresponding P4 and P5 had 23 nm ( 44 nm ) and 54 nm ( 105 nm ) of redder absorption maxima in solutions ( in solid films ) , respectively , which implied that the electron donor ( Th ) units had more contributions to enlarge the conjugation lengths in the copolymers than the BT units. Similar changes of UV - vis spectra were found in rigid π-conjugated polymers with an intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) interaction between electron donor and acceptor moieties. 14b,23 Interestingly , by increasing the numbers of the conjugated heterocyclic rings in the donor - acceptor systems , the gradually enhanced red - shifted absorption ( from solutions to solid films ) in P1-P5 were likely due to their longer conjugated organization , which led to higher aggregation forms of these copolymer chains in solid films in contrast to those in solutions. The optical band gaps ( E g opt ) of the copolymers in solid films , which were determined by the cutoff wavelengths of the optical absorptions , were in the range of 1.70 - 1.94 eV ( Table 2 ). As a result , the electron donor Th rings in combination with the electron acceptor BT rings 12,14b or cyano groups 24,25 presented a more extended π-conjugated system through the rigid main - chains and electron D-A chromophores , where the optical band gaps of P1-P6 were gradually lowered from P1 with the largest value of 1.94 eV to P5 with the narrowest value of 1.70 eV ( 0.24 eV lower than P1 ). As shown in Figure S1 ( see Supporting Information ) , the intensities of PL emission spectra in solid films of P4-P6 were more dramatically quenched than those in P1-P3 , which suggested that the more efficient photoinduced charge transfer was likely due to the presence of the stronger donor - acceptor effects. Thus , this charge transfer might be satisfactorily rapid to complete the radiative recombination of excitons. 26 The appropriate photophysical properties of these copolymers in solid films , including broad and strong optical absorptions as well as effective charge transfers , proposed their potential applications for photovoltaic cells described below.

    "sentence": "It suggested that P1 containing electron - donating CPDT and electron - accepting BT moieties was closer to be both p - type and n - type materials. As the electronaccepting character of BT moieties increased in P2 and P3 , they were found to be suitable as n - type materials than p - type materials. Besides , P4 , P5 , and P6 all exhibited partially reversible oxidation and reduction behavior as evident from the areas and close proximity of the anodic and cathodic scans , which were a good sign for high structural stability in the charged state. The moderate onset oxidation potentials and onset reduction potentials of P1-P6 were observed between 0.64 - 1.15 V and -(0.67-0.87) V , respectively , from which the HOMO levels of 5.04 - 5.55 eV and LUMO levels of 3.53 - 3.73 eV for all copolymers were calculated according to the following equation : 16b E HOMO / E LUMO ) [ -(E onset ( vs Ag / AgCl ) -E 1 / 2 (ferrocene)+4.8 ) ] eV , where 4.8 eV was the energy level of ferrocene below the vacuum level. It was worthwhile to note that the oxidation potentials of copolymers P1-P6 were significantly varied when different numbers of Th donor units and BT / cyano acceptor moieties were incorporated into the molecular structures. Interestingly , the oxidation potentials of P1-P3 and P6 were ca. 0.2 V higher than those of P4-P5 , thus indicating higher oxidation stability for P1-P3 and P6. The noticeably higher oxidation potentials P1-P3 and P6 can be explained by that the resulting conjugated copolymers were more electrondeficient due to the nitrogen atoms in their planar π-conjugated systems. Oppositely , in contrast to P4 , the oxidation potential of P5 was reduced by the extension of Th rings , and thus P5 showed a lower oxidation potential ( 0.64 V ) due to the longer Th ring. On the other hand , the LUMO energy level of the donor ( polymer ) has to be positioned above the LUMO energy level of the acceptor ( PCBM ) by at least 0.3 eV , so the exciton binding energy of polymer could be overcome and result in efficient electron transfer from donor to acceptor. 16b Hence , the electrochemical reduction potentials of copolymers P1-P6 showed similar LUMO energy levels at ca. 3.53 - 3.73 eV , which represented high electron affinity to make these copolymers suitable donors to inject and transport electrons to PCBM acceptor ( with 0.57 - 0.77 eV LUMO offsets regarding the LUMO level of PCBM at 4.3 eV 16 ) for the bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell devices. 27 The differences between the band gap values directly measured by CV ( E g ec between 1.51 and 1.83 eV ) and the optical band gap values obtained from UV - vis spectra ( E g opt between 1.70 and 1.94 eV ) lied within an acceptable range of errors.

Interestingly , except P2 , the annealed copolymers P1 and P3-P6 exhibited several strong diffraction peaks with high crystalline patterns , similar to the thiazole- 12a-e,13 and thiophenebased polymers. 4b,6c,28 Distinct primary diffraction peaks at 2θ ) 6.3 ° , 4.3 ° , 4.3 ° , 5.1 ° , 5.7 ° , and 5.4 ° ( small - angle region ) , corresponding to the d 1 -spacing values of 11.^9 , 17.3 , 17.3 , 15.1 , 13.3 , and 14.2 Å for copolymers P1-P6 , were assigned to the interchain spacing between polymer main chains , where the alkyl substituents were segregated as reported for similar π-conjugated polymers with long side chains. 4b,6c,12a-e,13,28 The second - order diffraction peaks for P1 and P3-P6 as well as the third - order diffraction peaks for P1 , P3 , and P6 were clearly observed at d 1 / n Å ( n ) 2-3 ) , respectively , which implied a highly organized assembly of these π-conjugated copolymers. Planar polymer molecules with side chains might prefer the faceto - face parallel packing. 13b Some reasonable packing modes of these copolymers in view of van der Waals contacts are depicted in Figure S2 ( see Supporting Information ). The distances between the segregation of the polymer main chains accounted for the interchain d 1 spacings. The distances between top and bottom layers of the backbones accounted for the π-π stacking at wide - angle d spacings. The regioregular π-π stacking distances of the backbones in P1-P6 were in the range of wideangle X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) at 3.55 - 3.66 Å , which were somewhat smaller than that ( ca. 3.80 Å ) observed in HT-P3RTh 29 with a similar stacked structure. It suggested that the π-conjugated polymers containing thiazole units had a stronger tendency to form the face - to - face stacking than those containing thiophene units. 13 In bithiazole - based copolymers P2 and P3 , the larger d 1 spacing of 17.3 Å was presumed to adopt the possible end - toend packing motifs and π-stacking structures , because the number density of the alkyl groups was similar to that of HT-P3RTh ( ca. 17.7 Å ) , 13a as illustrated in Figure S2(b ). Interestingly , P1 and P4-P6 showed smaller d 1 spacing values of 11.9 - 15.1 Å than P2 and P3 , which suggested that the packings of these copolymer chains were likely interdigitated in the lamellar sheets , as shown in Figure S2(a ). The number densities of the alkyl groups in these copolymers were not as high as those of P2 and P3 , and furthermore the nonsubstituted thiophene rings or arylcyanovinyl units provided a sufficient space to facilitate the side - chain interdigitation.",

Overall , the charge carrier mobilities of PSC devices were substantially improved by increasing the crystallinities and intermolecular stacking degrees in solid films. Organic Photovoltaic Cell Properties. According to the previously described physical properties of P1-P6 , these coplanar semiconducting copolymers P1-P6 are suitable for PSC applications. To investigate the potential use of copolymers P1-P6 in PSCs , bulk heterojunction PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / P1 - P6 : PCBM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) / Ca / Al were fabricated from an active layer where copolymers P1-P6 were blended with a complementary fullerene - based electron acceptor ( PCBM ) in a weight ratio of 1 : 1 ( w / w ) initially ( and later followed with various weight ratios for the optimum copolymer ). The photovoltaic properties of PSC devices containing copolymers P1 - P6 : PCBM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) are listed in Table 4. Parts a and b of Figure 4 illustrate I-V curves and EQE values , respectively , for PSC devices containing copolymers P1 - P6 : PCBM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) under monochromatic illumination , where EQE is displayed as a function of wavelength. Due to the minor variations in open circuit voltage ( V oc ) values ( 0.822 - 0.630 V ) in P1-P6 , Figure 4a demonstrates the sequence of the best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) values for P4 , P1 , and P2 according to their short circuit current density ( I sc ) values of 7.70 , 6.34 , and 5.26 mA / cm^2 , respectively. As shown in Figure 4b , broader EQE curves for P4 , P1 , and P2 covered almost the entire visible spectrum from 350 to 650 nm with the maximum EQE values of 60% , 50% , and 40% , respectively , which also explained for their high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) values over 2.12% . Among these PSC devices containing copolymers P1-P6 , the best performance was the PSC device fabricated by P4 : PCBM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) which reached an AM 1.5G power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 2.79% , with a short circuit current density ( I sc ) of 7.70 mA / cm^2 , an open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.683 V , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 0.53.",

    "sentence": "Due to the requirements of higher charge mobilities and better absorptions of polymers in PSC devices , 30 the hole mobility values of copolymers P1-P6 were ( see Table 4 ) estimated from eq 1 J ) 9ε 0 ε r µV 2 / 8L 3 ( 1 ) via space - charge limit current ( SCLC ) by fabricating a holeonly device , 17 where ε 0 ε r is the permittivity of the polymer , µ is the carrier mobility , L is the device thickness. Ideally , I sc was determined by the product of the photoinduced charge carrier density and the charge carrier mobility within the organic semiconductors. 31a Surprisingly , the hole mobilities of copolymers P5-P6 were not as high as those of copolymers P1-P4 , which was probably due to the lower molecular weights and worse soubilities resulting in inferior film - forming qualities , even though their optical band gaps were smaller than the other copolymers ( P1-P4 ). Thus , due to the relatively lower hole mobilities and less light - harvesting capabilities at the longer absorption wavelength ranges of P3 , P5 , and P6 , their PSC devices showed lower photocurrent values of 4.43 , 3.03 , and 2.68 mA / cm^2 , respectively , in comparison with those containing P1 , P2 , and P4. This phenomenon of lower photocurrents further explained the worse EQE values and narrower absorption wavelength regions in the PSC devices containing copolymers P3 , P5 , and P6 , where the EQE values of the visible spectra from 350 to 600 nm were only below 40% . Thus , not only optical properties but also charge transporting properties could be tuned by changing the lengths of oligothienyl and bithiazolebased main - chains. Comparing the FF values in P1-P4 ( excluding P5-P6 due to their poor soubilities ) , the highest values of 53% in PSC devices containing copolymers P1 and P4 were obtained likely due to the more densely packed lamellar sheets in P1 and P4 ( with smaller d 1 spacing values of 11.9 and 15.1 Å resulting from highly ordered structural packings ) than P2 and P3 with a longer d 1 spacing value of 17.3 Å ) , as proven by XRD patterns previously. The V oc values covered a rather wide range among the PSC devices containing copolymers P1-P6 , which were related to the differences of energy levels between the HOMO levels of the polymers and the LUMO levels of the acceptors. 31 Therefore , the PSC devices containing copolymers P1 , P2 , and P3 ( with HOMO energy levels of -5.40 , -5.51 , and -5.55 eV , respectively ) showed slight increases of V oc values ( 0.730 , 0.777 , and 0.822 V , respectively ) , which indicated that the insertion of more bithiazole units had some influence on the relationship between the HOMO levels of copolymers and the V oc values of PSC devices.",

Using lower weight ratios of PCBM in blended copolymers P4 : PCBM ( P4 : PCBM)1 : 0.5 and 1 : 1 w / w ) led to reductions in the I sc values due to the inefficient charge separation and electron transporting properties , resulting in the lower PCE results. 30b However , loading larger weight ratios of PCBM in blended copolymers P4 : PCBM ( 1 : 3 and 1 : 4 w / w ) also reduced the I sc and PCE values , which could be probably attributed to the increased aggregation of PCBM so as to influence the separation of charges. Furthermore , an unbalanced charge transporting property was introduced due to the large PCBM ratio. Hence , both I sc and PCE values decreased with larger PCBM molar ratios of 1 : 3 and 1 : 4 ( w / w ) because of the two reasons described here. 32 Therefore , the most efficient PSC device with the maximum PCE value of 3.04% was established by the blended copolymer P4 with a weight ratio of P4 / PCBM ) 1 : 2 in this report , which has a similar result as the PSC devices containing thiophene - based polymers. 11b,33 Using the concept of incorporating electron - withdrawing groups in the donor - acceptor conjugated copolymers , we have successfully synthesized six cyclopentadithiophene-bithiazolebased copolymers ( P1-P6 ) employing oligo(bithiazole) , bithiazole-oligo(thiophene) , and diarylene-cyanovinylenebithiazole groups by palladium(0) - catalyzed Stille coupling reactions.

Compared with the control polymer bearing alkyl side chains ( P-Alkyl ) , P-OEG exhibits not only smaller π-π stacking distance and redshifted absorption spectra , but also larger surface energy for better compatibility with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) electron acceptor. PSC device of P-OEG exhibits the open - circuit voltage ( VOC ) of 0.73 V , short - circuit current density ( JSC ) of 13.92 mA cm^-2 , fill factor ( FF ) of 0.50 , corresponding to the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 5.10% . This performance is higher than that of P-Alkyl ( PCE = 3.0% ) , which is attributed to the finer phase separation morphology of P-OEG:PC71BM blend than that of P-Alkyl:PC71BM blend. These results suggest that branched OEG side chain is an effective approach to improve PSC device performance of some polymer electron donors .

[1][2][3][4][5][6] Using conjugated polymers as electron donors and fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors , power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of single - junction PSCs have exceed 10% [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] . For solution processability , polymer electron donors are almost always composed of conjugated main chain and flexible alkyl side chains. It is widely accepted that optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers are predominantly determined by the conjugated main chains. [14][15][16] Although alkyl side chains are inert in opto - electronics , they can affect solubility , solid - state packing behaviours and blend morphology of polymer donors. [17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] Great efforts have been devoted to optimize the type , length , and branching point of alkyl side chains for excellent PSC device performance. [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34] However , polymer electron donors bearing alternative kind of side chains are rarely reported. Oligo(ethylene glycol ) ( OEG ) chain is well - known for its hydrophilicity 35,36 and is widely used in bio-related applications and self - assembly applications. [37][38][39][40][41][42] Conjugated polymers bearing straight OEG side chains have already been reported and used in efficient organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) and PSCs. [43][44][45][46][47][48][49] We have discovered that OEG chains are more flexible than alkyl chains and that OEG chains can promote π-π stacking of conjugated polymer main chains. 50 We have also developed branched OEG side chains for conjugated polymers. 51 Isoindigo is a widely used electron - deficient unit to design donor - acceptor ( D-A ) type conjugated polymers for high - performance PSCs and OFETs applications.",

    "sentence": "A large family of polymer electron donors based on isoindigo unit bearing alkyl side chain have been reported [52][53][54][55][56] and used in PSCs. However , to the best of our Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as the active layer shows the PCE of 3.0% . The moderate PSC device performance is due to the poor phase separation morphology of the active layer and the insufficient driving force for charge separation. 58,59 In this manuscript , we report a new polymer electron donor based on isoindigo unit bearing branched OEG side chains , P-OEG. As shown in Scheme 1 , P-OEG has the same main chain but different side chain with that of P-Alkyl. Compared with P-Alkyl , P-OEG exhibits not only smaller π-π stacking distance , but also larger surface energy and consequently better compatibility with PC71BM. PSC device of P-OEG also exhibits higher PCE than that of P-Alkyl. These results suggest that branched OEG side chains is an effective approach to improve PSC device performance of some polymer electron donors . Synthesis and Characterization. According to thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) ( Fig. S1 ) , P-OEG shows good thermal stability with thermal degradation temperature ( T d ) at 5% weight loss of 379 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Molecular stacking. Fig. 1 shows the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction ( GI - XRD ) patterns of the drop - cast films of P-OEG Scheme 2 Synthetic routes of the polymers.

P-OEG exhibits strong diffraction peak at 24.4 o , corresponding to the π-π stacking distance of polymer backbone ( d π-π ) of 0.364 nm ( Table 2 ). In comparison , the d π-π of P-Alkyl is estimated to be 0.376 nm. The d π-π of P-OEG is smaller than that of P-Alkyl. As discussed in our previous paper , this is due to the more flexibility of OEG chains compared to alkyl chains. 50,51 Photophysical and Electrochemical Properties. Fig. 2 shows the UV - Vis absorption spectra of P-OEG and P-Alkyl in chloroform solution and in thin film. The characteristics are listed in Table 2. P-OEG and P-Alkyl exhibit similar absorption spectra in solution because of their identical conjugated main chain. In thin film , the absorption spectrum of P-OEG redshifts by 14 nm compared to that of P-Alkyl. This is attributed to the decreased d π-π of P-OEG , which leads to improved interaction of polymer main chains. As listed in Table 2 , the optical band gaps ( E g ) of P-OEG is 1.54 eV , which is smaller than that of P-Alkyl ( E g = 1.62 eV ).",

Compared with alkyl chains , OEG chains should have better compatibility with the solvent / compensating ions. This may affect the electrochemical oxidation / reduction process of the conjugated polymer backbone. So we need to be cautious about the E LUMO / E HOMO of the two polymers estimated with CV. Hole mobility. The hole mobility ( μ h ) of the two polymers were and 3 vol % for P-OEG and P-Alkyl , respectively. The weight ratio of the polymers to PC71BM was fixed to be 1 : 1 ( w / w ). Fig. 5 shows the J-V curves and external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of the devices under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination calibrated at 100 mW cm^-2 . The device characteristics are listed in Table 3 Active Layer Morphology. To further elucidate the different photovoltaic performances of the two polymers , we investigate the active layer morphology of the four devices using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) in tapping mode and bright - field transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ). Fig. 6 shows the TEM images of the active layers of the four devices. Without the DIO solvent additive , both the films of P-OEG:PC71BM and P-Alkyl:PC71BM exhibit large - size phase separation with isolated PC71BM domains ( dark regions in TEM images ) of about 300 nm. The domain size is much larger than that ( 10 nm-20 nm ) required for bulk heterojunction PSCs and leads to ineffective exciton dissociation and low J SC . Application of DIO solvent additive leads to significantly decreased phase separation size , which is in accordance with the much increased J SC of the devices processed with DIO. In comparison , the P-OEG:PC71BM blend processed with DIO solvent additive exhibits much finer phase separation than that of P-Alkyl:PC71BM. This is consistent with the better PSC device performance of the P-OEG:PC71BM blend than that of P-Alkyl:PC71BM. The intimate mixing P-OEG:PC71BM blend may be attributed to the increased surface energy of P-OEG , which leads to good miscibility with PC71BM. Fig. 7 shows the AFM height images of the four active layers. AFM results also supports the well mixed phase separation morphology of the P-OEG:PC71BM blend than that of P-Alkyl:PC71BM when processed with DIO solvent additive. The root-mean-square ( RMS ) roughness obtained from the AFM height images is 9.03 nm and 12.50 nm for the P-OEG:PC71BM blend and P-Alkyl:PC71BM blend processed with pure chlorobenzene , respectively. When DIO solvent additive is used , the RMS roughness of the P-OEG:PC71BM film and P-Alkyl:PC71BM film decreases to 1.07 nm and 4.52 nm , respectively . In conclusion , we have developed a polymer electron donor based on isoindigo unit bearing branched OEG side chains.",

    "sentence": "5 , 2 , 5 ]thiadiazole (FBT)-based conjugated donor - acceptor ( D-A ) polymers with straight and branched side chains were synthesized via Stille - coupling copolymerization to study their physical , optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties. The results show that both the nature of pendant side chains and the electron acceptor strength of the acceptor moiety of D-A polymers have critical impacts on material and photovoltaic properties. Better π-π stacking of polymer backbones enabled by appropriate substituents such as fluorine atoms and branched alkyl chains leads to a reasonably high power conversion efficiency of over 6% when the polymer is utilized as a donor material with PC71BM as an active layer in bulk heterojunction solar cells . Over the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted considerable attention owing to their unique advantages which include potentially low manufacturing cost , lightweight characteristics , and device structural flexibility , 1-7 to name a few. Currently the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) architecture is commonly adopted in PSC devices for its easier fabrication , more efficient charge separation , and potentially higher power conversion efficiency ( PCE ). In a typical BHJ architecture , the active layer generally consists of an electron - accepting fullerene derivative dispersed in an electron - donating conjugated polymer matrix. 8 An illustrative example is an active layer composed of a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) and methanofullerene-6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ). This system has been extensively studied in BHJ PSC with a PCE of about 4-5 % . However , the narrow absorption spectral properties and high HOMO level of P3HT are the major drawbacks for further improvement of device efficiency. 9-12 To overcome this problem , considerable studies have been directed toward development of low - band gap polymers and device optimization. 13 Common design considerations for efficient low - band gap polymers for BHJ PSCs can be generalized as follows : ( 1 ) reasonable solution - processability to enable excellent thin - film formation with electron accepting materials ( e.g. , PCBM ) ; ( 2 ) good matching of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels between the polymer and fullerene derivatives to facilitate efficient excition dissociation and charge transfer ; ( 3 ) a low - band gap ( 1.3 - 1.9 eV ) to harvest more solar energy. One common strategy for low - band gap polymer design is use of alternating electron donor and acceptor ( D-A ) polymer structure , which provides flexibility in tuning the energy levels of the polymer through its constituent donor and acceptor strengths. Several D-A polymers of this nature have been reported to achieve PCE of over 8% in BHJs. 14 Among various D-A polymers , benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole-(BT-) based polymers have been actively studied as donor materials for BHJ PSCs.",

    "sentence": "15-18 Although the energy levels of these D-A polymers can be adjusted by their BT moieties , the resulting band - gaps are generally in the 1.7 - 1.9 eV regime , which adversely limits solar energy harvesting. Significant amount of work has subsequently been conducted on BT modification to improve polymer 's solar energy harvesting capability. These modified structures include , for example , benzobisthiadiazole , 19,20 [1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4-g]quinoxaline 21 and naphtho [1,2-c:5,6-c]bis [1,2,5]thiadiazole. 22 Most recently , fluorinated benzothiadiazole - based D-A polymers have been demonstrated to be promising electron - donor polymers for BHJ PSCs , providing PCE ranging from about 4% to over 7% . 23-26 The incorporation of fluorine atom appears to be advantageous in two respects : ( 1 ) it lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , resulting in an increased open voltage ( V oc ) ; ( 2 ) it provides inter or intramolecular F-H bonding , which help facilitate better π-π stacking leading to a greater extent of backbone ordering. In this article , we report the synthesis , characterization , and photovoltaic studies of novel 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole - based D-A polymers PFBT-T12TT and PFBT-T20TT ( see Scheme 1 ) , respectively with pendant straight and branched long alkyl chain substitutions. An analogous polymer based on nonfluorinated benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole has been reported to give a PCE of 0.42% . 27 Our investigation shows that both branched alkyl chain and fluorine substitutions are important for achieving high PCEs. Branched alkyl substituents are critical in improving polymer processability for fabrication of good thin films while the fluorine substitution enhances the intermolecular interaction. On the other hand , with straight alkyl chain substitution , the polymer suffers from limited solubility and thus difficult processability. Specifically , PFBT-T20TT exhibits strong broad absorptions and enhanced intermolecular polymer chain interaction in its thin film state. When used as the donor material and blended with PC71BM to form an active layer in BHJ devices , high PCE of over 6% was obtained. For comparison , BHJ devices with various different donor systems were fabricated and evaluated under the same condition. The results clearly revealed that much higher photovoltaic performance can be achieved by devices based on PFBT-T20TT than those from PBT-T12TT and PFBT-T12TT. Consequently , the incorporation of fluorine atom and long branched side chains in polymer backbone would be a viable strategy for designing desirable polymer donors for BHJ PSC application . Synthesis. The synthesis of polymers , PFBT-T12TT , PFBT-T20TT , and the analogous polymer PBT-T12TT is described in Scheme 1. Stille - coupling reaction of 5,6-difluoro-4,7-diiodobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole , synthesized according to literature procedure , 23 with 2-tributylstannyl-4-dodecylthiophene or 2-tributylstannyl-4-(2-octyldodecyl)-thiophene afforded intermediate compounds 1 or 2 , respectively. Bromination of 1 or 2 with NBS afforded respectively the corresponding bromides 3 or 4 , which was used in subsequent polymerization. Purifications of the crude polymers were effected by Soxhlet extraction sequentially with methanol and hexane to remove low molecular weight impurities and then with chlorobenzene to extract the polymer product.",

    "sentence": "Finally , the chlorobenzene fraction was collected , concentrated and reprecipitated from methanol to afford the desired polymers. PFBT-T12TT was obtained as a dark purple solid in 28% yield. However , the polymer exhibited poor solubility in common organic solvents ; only a very small quantity could be dissolved in hot chlorobenzene. On the other hand , polymer PFBT-T20TT showed significantly better solubility and a dramatically improved yield of 65% was obtained. PFBT-T20TT was soluble in warm chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene but has limited solubility in chloroform and THF. In addition , the analogous polymer PBT-T12TT was also synthesized and purified accordingly to afford a dark brown solid in 75% yield. Optical Properties. The absorption spectra of PBT-T12TT , PFBT-T12TT , and PFBT-T20TT in chlorobenzene and as thin films are shown in parts a and b of Figure 1 with the corersponding photophysical data summarized Table 1. In solution , all three polymers showed two absorption bands , attributable to π-π* transition at low wavelength region and intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) at longer wavelength region. The absorptions of both the fluorinated polymers , PFBT-T12TT and PFBT-T20TT , were red - shifted compared to those of the nonfluorinated polymer , PBT-T12TT , an optoelectronic effect arising from the electron withdrawing fluorine substitution. The fluorinated polymer , PFBT-T20TT , also displayed an obvious shoulder peak at ∼ 640 nm. This shoulder absorption was absent in the spectrum of PFBT-T12TT , indicating some degree of short - range π-π stacking of polymer chains of PFBT-T20TT even in solution. In thin - film spectra , the absorptions of PBT-T12TT and PFBT-T12TT were red - shifted from those in solution , suggesting aggregation and higher ordering in the solid state. A shoulder peak at ∼ 690 nm was also observed for PFBT-T12TT , implying better packing in its solid state compared to its nonfluorinated analogue , PBT-T12TT. Surprisingly , the thin - film spectrum of PFBT-T20TT was almost identical to its solution spectrum. This would suggest that the ordering states for the polymer remained relatively similar in both solution and solid state. This was likely due to the to the steric effects of the bulky branched alkyl chain substituents which severely limited the polymer from achieving higher ordering in the solid state from that in solution. However , when temperature was raised from room temperature to 250 °C , a bathochromic shift of around 10 nm could be observed in PFBT-T20TT film absorption , indicating an improved π-π stacking attained in the polymer chains. The optical band - gaps ( E g opt ) of PFBT-T12TT and PFBT-T20TT as deduced from the absorption edge of thin - film spectra were respectively 1.57 and 1.59 eV. Electrochemical Properties. The thin - film cyclic voltammetric properties of PFBT-T12TT and PFBT-T20TT are shown in Figure 2. The HOMO levels were estimated from the onsets of their corresponding oxidative peaks. The LUMO levels were then calculated from the differences between the HOMO energy level and the optical band gaps.",

Bulk Heterojunction Photovoltaic Device Performance. BHJ PSCs were fabricated with a general device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PFBT-T20TT:PC71BM / Ca / Al and the performance was measured under 100 mW / cm^2 AM 1.5 G illumination. The ratio of PFBT-T20TT to PC71BM was adjusted from 1 : 1 to 1 : 4 ( w : w ). Repeated measurements were performed on the devices. The current density - voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency of devices are shown in Figure 3 , parts a and b. The device performance data are shown in Table 2. As can be noted , the optimized polymer to PC71BM ratio was about 1 : 2 when a V oc of 0.82 V , a J sc of 12.93 mA / cm^2 , and FF of 60.9% were obtained , delivering a best PCE of 6.3% and an average PCE of 5.55% . EQE curves indicate that the active layer of PFBT-T20TT:PC71BM ( 1 : 2 ) can provide high photon - to - current conversion of ∼ 60% across the visible region of 400-700 nm. In addition , PSCs with PBT-T12TT , PFBT-T12TT , and PFBT-T20TT as different polymer donor systems were fabricated and tested under the same condition. Device performance was characterized by J-V curves and EQE measurements as shown in Figure 4 , and the characterization data are summarized in Table 3. The results clearly show that under the same fabrication conditions , the PFBT-T20TT - based devices achieved the highest PCE of 3.3% as compared to those based on PBT-T12TT and PFBT-T12TT , which exhibited PCEs of only 0.57% and 0.02% respectively. The dramatically improved device performance of PFBT-T20TT could be attributed to its broader spectral absorption coverage. The absorptions of PFBT-T20TT were red - shifted by approximately 170 nm from those of the nonfluorinated polymer ( PBT-T12TT ) , and extended to the near IR region , resulting in more efficient solar energy harvesting. On the other hand , while the absorption spectrum of PFBT-T12TT was equally broad in the visible light region , it yielded poor device performance with very low PCE. This apparent anomaly may be attributable to the poor solubility of PFBT-T12TT. On the other hand , although PFBT-T12TT has a lower HOMO level than PFBT-T20TT , the V oc of its corresponding device is smaller than the latter one.",

    "sentence": "Although the tetracyclic angular - shaped naphthodithiophenes ( aNDTs ) derivatives are an emergent building block for constructing promising semiconductor conjugated polymers , the absence of aliphatic side chains as solubilizing groups on the aNDTs greatly restricted their further application toward polymer synthesis. To create a new class of aNDT - based polymers for widespread applications in solution - processable OFETs and PSCs , side - chain engineering of the aNDT - based structures plays a pivotal role in improving solubility and optimizing electronic / steric properties associated with the resultant solar cell characteristics. In this research , we developed an efficient and straightforward methodology to construct the angular naphthodithophene core with regiospecific introduction of two aliphatic chains at its 4,9-positions via a base - induced double 6π-cyclization. For the first time , the corresponding 2,7-distannylated-4,9-dialkylated aNDT monomers were polymerized with FBT and DPP acceptors to make two new PaNDTDTFBT and PaNDTDPP donor - acceptor copolymers. The photovoltaic devices based on the PaNDTDTFBT : PC71BM blend not only showed a promising PCE of 6.52% with conventional configuration but also achieved a higher PCE of 6.86% with inverted configuration. Moreover , PaNDTDPP with strong intermolecular interaction achieved a high FET hole mobility of 0.202 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Donor - acceptor ( D-A ) copolymers have been extensively utilized in organic photovoltaics ( OPVs ) and organic fieldeffect transistors ( OFETs ) due to their easy tunability of molecular properties and excellent solution processability. A variety of novel electron - rich conjugated building blocks have thus been developed for polymerization. Compared to the tricyclic benzodithiophene derivatives representing the most successful component for constructing high - performance D-A copolymers of OPVs , the tetracyclic naphthodithiophenes ( NDTs ) also attract growing attention considering their extended conjugation as well as diverse structures. Depending on the molecular geometry , the NDT derivatives can have linear - shaped ( lNDT ) and angular - shaped ( aNDT ) isomeric structures ( Figure 1 ). It was found that aNDT - based copolymers have higher ordered structures than the lNDTbased copolymers , thereby achieving higher OFET mobilities. Furthermore , the aNDT molecules exhibit lower - lying HOMO energy levels than the lNDT counterparts , which are beneficial for better air stability and greater open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) for OPVs. To fully exploit the aNDT - containing polymers for the optoelectronic applications , side - chain engineering by introducing solubilizing groups onto an aNDT framework is highly essential to not only ensure the solution processability but also induce suitable molecular packing. To address the issue , Takimiya and Osaka first introduced two alkyl groups at the outer positions ( 5,10-positions ) of the central naphthalene moiety in the aNDT. Compared to the polymer incorporating the unsubstituted aNDT units , the 5,10-dialkyl aNDT - based copolymer showed a better solubility and orientational order , leading to an impressive power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) over 8% . Li et al. reported a 4,9-dialkoxy aNDT - based D-A copolymer delivering moderate solar cell performances.",

    "sentence": "It is thus desirable to further create another isomeric structure , 4,9-dialkyl-aNDT , to investigate the substituent effects on the electronic and structural properties of the resulting copolymers. In this regard , we have developed a useful methodology to regiospecifically implant two alkyl chains at the inner 4,9-positions of an aNDT unit. By using this synthetic strategy , two 4,9-di(2-octyldodecyl) aNDT ( aNDT-OD ) and 4,9-di(2butyloctyl) aNDT ( aNDT-BO ) units were successfully synthesized. The two corresponding distannylated aNDT ( Sn-aNDT ) monomers were copolymerized with 4,7-bis(5bromo-4-octylthiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole ( DTFBT ) and 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) acceptors to prepare two PaNDTDTFBT and PaNDTDPP copolymers , respectively ( Figure 1 ). Their molecular properties have been carefully characterized , and bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells incorporating the polymers have exhibited promising photovoltaic performance in both conventional and inverted architectures . The synthesis of the monomers Sn-aNDT is described in Scheme 1. The molecular weight of PaNDTDTFBT ( M n = 67.8 kDa ; PDI = 1.2 ) and PaNDTDPP ( M n = 23.1 kDa ; PDI = 3.1 ) was determined by GPC measurements in THF. The thermal stability of two polymers was measured by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ). PaNDTDTFBT and PaNDTDPP showed sufficiently high decomposition temperatures ( T d ) of 447 and 429 °C , respectively ( Figure 2 ). According to the differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) analysis , PaNDTDPP does not show obvious melting point ( T m ) while PaNDTDTFBT exhibits crystalline nature with the observation of a T m at 300 °C during heating and a crystallization point ( T c ) at 280 °C upon cooling ( Figure 3 ). Two - dimensional wide - angle X-ray diffraction ( 2D-WAXD ) was employed to investigate the crystallinity of two polymers which were extruded as a fiber at 250 °C in the solid state. The results are shown in Figure 4. Diffraction arcs were distinctly observed in PaNDTDTFBT ( Figure 4a ). However , only diffraction rings were observed in PaNDTDPP ( Figure 4b ) , implying that PaNDTDTFBT possesses a more ordered and closer backbone structure than PaNDTDPP , and hence the higher π-stacking crystallinity. The crystalline nature of PaNDTDTFBT is also consistent with the observation of a T m at 300 °C from its DSC curve. The absorption spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure 5. Both of the polymers exhibited two distinct bands in the absorption spectra. Compared to PaNDTDTFBT showing the absorption maxima at 600 nm in the solution and the solid state , PaNDTDPP exhibited the apparent bathochromic shift of the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) band at 728 nm and showed a tailing of the absorption band with a shoulder around 850 nm in the thin film , which comes from the strong intermolecular interactions.",

It is worth noting that compared to the alkoxy substituents , the less donating alkyl groups at the 4,9-positions of the aNDT could lower the HOMO levels of the aNDTbased copolymers. On the other hand , the LUMO energy levels are approximately located at -3.50 eV for PaNDTDTFBT and -3.64 eV for PaNDTDPP , which are higher than the LUMO level of the PC71BM ( -3.8 eV ) to ensure energetically favorable electron transfer. The electron densities are homogeneously distributed along the molecular backbone in the HOMOs but located at the FBT or the DPP acceptor regions in the LUMOs , indicating distinct intramolecular charge transfer between donor and acceptor upon excitation. The energy of HOMO-LUMO transition is calculated to be 705 nm for aNDTDTFBT and 739 nm for aNDTDPP , which are in acceptable agreement with their experimental ICT absorption ( 650 and 730 nm in ODCB , respectively ). The hole mobilities were calculated from the transfer characteristics of the devices in the saturation regime. The OFET devices used SiO2 as gate dielectric whose surfaces were modified with octadecyltrichlorosilane ( ODTS ) to form a self - assembled monolayer ( SAM ). The hole mobility of the PaNDTDTFBT device is 4.7 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with an on - off ratio of 1.0 × 10^5 . Moreover , PaNDTDPP flanked with the shorter 2-butyloctyl groups at the aNDT core possesses highest hole mobility , reaching 0.202 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with a on - off ratio of 1.0 × 10^4 , which is attributed to the strong π-π stacking of the polymer backbone associated with the rigid and coplanar structure of the aNDT units ( Table 3 ). Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated on the basis of traditional ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PCBM / Ca / Al conventional configuration. The current density - voltage characteristics of the devices under simulated 100 mW cm^-2 AM 1.5 G illumination are shown in Figure 9 , and all the device parameters are shown in Table 4.",

Compared to the conventional devices , the BHJ devices with an inverted architecture possess much improved long - term stability and better architecture for roll - to - roll fabrication in the OPV industry. The inverted devices were fabricated based on the configuration of ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO3 / Ag. The inverted device using PaNDTDTFBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 1.2 , in wt % ) blend with 5 vol % CN delivered a comparable PCE of 6.50% with a high FF of 71% . By adding 5 vol % CN into ODCB along with a buffer layer PFN 17 to modify the work funtion of ZnO , the device further achieved the highest PCE of 6.86% with a good V oc of 0.84 V , an improved J sc of 11.38 mA / cm^2 , and a higher FF of 71.8% . The corresponding external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) for both the conventional and inverted solar cells were measured under illumination of monochromatic light to confirm the accuracy of the measurements of the devices ( Figure 9b ). The J sc calculated from integration of the EQE spectra with an AM 1.5 G reference spectrum agrees well with the J sc obtained from the J-V measurements. The morphology of the films was evaluated by atomic force microscope ( AFM ) to understand the performance enhancement ( Figure 10 ).",

In no event shall the Royal Society of Chemistry be held responsible for any errors or omissions in this Accepted Manuscript or any consequences arising from the use of any information it contains . Atom decoration of conjugated materials has proven to be an effective route to modulate their electronic properties. 1 Fluorine ( F ) , for example , has been introduced to both the side - chain and backbone of many systems. In many cases , fluorinated donor - acceptor ( D-A ) conjugated polymers , especially when the fluorine atom is introduced into the acceptor unit , show improved photovoltaic properties. The fluorination of thienothiophene ( TT ) , 2,3 benzothiadiazole ( BT ) , 4,5 benzotriazole ( TAZ ) 6,7 and quinoxaline 8,9 building block yielded polymers with high power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ). Aside from the change of electronic properties , fluorination can also alter the structure and miscibility with other materials. 10,11 An obvious benefit of introducing fluorine is to lower the highest occupied molecular orbitals ( HOMO ) level , which would lead to a larger energy offset with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of PCBM to create a larger open - circuit voltage ( V oc ). 12,13 Yu and coworkers , for example , showed that introducing a fluorine atom to thieno [3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene copolymer significantly improved the V oc without changing the short - circuit current ( J sc ) and fill factor ( FF ). 2,14 In other cases , fluorinated polymer also showed improvement in J sc and FF solar cell devices. 15 However , the amount and positioning of the fluorine is important. 16,17 Consequently , a more detailed study on the impact of fluorine on the structure - property relationship is critical. Here , we choose diaryl-diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) as the key building block to carry out a systematic study of the \" F effect \" . DPP can be readily synthesized by a condensation reaction , and phenyl or thienyl groups are often used as substituents. The DPP unit has a large planar π surface , exhibits strong π-π interactions and an electron - deficiency , and is a good building block to construct low band gap polymers. 18,19 However , in most cases , DPP - based copolymers show a high J sc but low V oc ( < 0.8 eV ). 20,21 Further deepening the HOMO energy levels of DPP materials can be beneficial. Unfortunately , the simple chemical modification of replacing the thiophene by furan , selenophene , and thieno [3,2-b]thiophene does not significantly improve the V oc . 22,23 Fluorination of DPP unit is another route that can be used. Herein , diphenyl-DPP was used as a model compound.",

These building blocks were then copolymerized with BDT to generate conjugated polymers PDPP , Po - fDPP , Po - ffDPP , Pm - fDPP , and Pm - ffDPP. The influence of fluorination on the optoelectronic properties , crystallinity , Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) morphology , and device efficiency were systematically studied . To clarify the molecular structure , four fluorinated DPP monomers with short ethyl or n-butyl side chains were synthesized. Single crystals of these molecules were obtained by slow solvent evaporation of 1,4-dioxane solutions. The crystal structures determined by X-ray diffraction were presented in Fig. 1 , and the corresponding crystallographic data were summarized in Table S1 . The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C / min ( Figure S13 and S14 ). The onset of decomposition temperatures ( Td , corresponding to 5% weight loss ) were all above 400 °C ( Table 1 ) , indicating high thermal stability. Since our results showed no significant differences between the Tdvalues of the five polymers , we concluded that the amount and position of fluorination did not influence the polymer thermal stability . The UV - vis absorption spectra of all five polymers in dilute chloroform solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 3 , and the data are listed in Table 2. In dilute solution , all the spectra exhibited two absorption bands , one π-π * transitions bands between 300 and 450 nm , and the other characteristic intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) peaks at the low energy absorption bands ( 450 ~ 700 nm ). Although the backbones of the showing a significant red shift of 39 and 47 nm. This obvious red shift of ICT peaks for meta-fluorinated polymers could be attributed to the increased effective conjugation lengths induced by intramolecular F°°°S interactions , 30,31 which will be discussed in the theoretical calculation section. The four fluorinated polymers exhibited almost the same absorption coefficient of ~ 6.0 × 10^4 M -1 cm^-1 , slightly higher than that of non-fluorinated polymer ( ~ 5.0 × 10^4 M -1 cm^-1 ). In thin film , all polymers showed a slight red - shift about 2 ~ 12 nm except Po - ffDPP. Thus these polymers adopted a similar geometry in solid as they in solution. The interchain stacking can be weak due to the large twisting angle in diphenyl-DPP unit.",

    "sentence": "The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry from the onset potentials of the first oxidation and reduction peaks , respectively. These results were shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2. All the polymers exhibited similar oxidative and reductive onset potentials with good reversible waves. The oxidative and reductive onset potentials of the polymers located at about 0.8 and -1.2 eV , respectively , corresponding to HOMO and LUMO energy levels of about -5.60 eV and -3.60 eV. The introduction of fluorine atoms onto the phenyl units has a negligible effect on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels with less than 0.1 eV variations in all five copolymers. Therefore , the HOMO-LUMO band gaps of all the polymers are nearly identical ( ~ 2.0 eV ). This result differs from the often - observed decrease of HOMO and / or LUMO levels in fluorinated D-A polymers. 12,13 This may arise from the fact that DPP unit is strong in accepting electron clouds. The addition of F atom does not strongly modify the electron cloud distribution of the resulting materials . Quantum chemistry calculations were used to model the influence of fluorination on both the physical structure and energy levels of the polymers. To make computation possible , we chose three repeating units as simplified models , and the 2-ethylhexyl side chains were substituted by methyl groups. The geometries of the trimer models were optimized using density functional theory ( DFT ) at the B3LYP / 6-31G level. Crystalline molecular structure is used as initial guess of the DPP monomer to build trimers. The optimized conformations and dihedral angles between the phenyl rings and BDT units are illustrated in Fig. 5. For PDPP , dihedral angles of 22 ~ 27 ° are induced between the phenyl rings and BDT units as a consequence of steric hindrance. Fluorination at the ortho-positions of flanking phenyl units will not affect the torsion between the phenyl rings and BDT units , showing almost the same dihedral angles as to PDPP. In contrast , meta-fluorinated Pm - fDPP and Pm - ffDPP trimers favor more planar fashions and decrease the dihedral angles to 10 ~ 16 ° between fluorinated phenyl units and BDT units. The higher degree of backbone coplanarity is ascribed to the interactions between F ( in benzene ) and S ( in BDT ) interactions. 30,31 In DFT calculation , Pm - fDPP and Pm - ffDPP trimers show a F°°°S distance of about 2.78 Å , which is significantly shorter than the sum of F and S van der Waals radius of 3.2 Å. However , it is worth noting that fluorine atom has negligible contribution ( ≤ 0.11% ) to both the HOMO and LUMO electron density in all trimers , 32 which agrees well with the CV results .",

Fig. 6 showed the current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves , and the photovoltaic data of the devices are summarized in Table 3. All the active layers were spin - coated from DCB , and the D / A blend ratio by weight ( polymer / PC71BM ) was 1 : 1.5. For PDPP , a moderate PCE of 1.70% was achieved , with a J sc of 4.81 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.78 V , and a FF of 45% . Diphenyl-DPP-co-BDT based polymers usually showed a poor photovoltaic performance , as reported by Patil and co-workers. 33 The low J sc is the major limiting factor. This is because the DPP core has steric interactions with the adjacent phenyl groups , producing a twisted molecular geometry to prevent strong intermolecular π-π interactions and weaken the ability for the materials to crystallize , resulting in low charge carrier mobilities. 34 The large optical bandgaps ( ~ 2 eV ) is another important factor limiting the J sc . It was found that after monofluorination on the phenyl units , the J sc dropped from 4. when compared to non-fluorinated analogues. 16,32 All these polymers exhibited a similar V oc , no improvement was realized by fluorination. Among all the polymers , Pm - fDPP exhibited the highest V oc of 0.83 V , which was only improved by 0.05 V comparing to PDPP. Similar to V oc , fluorination showed little influence on the FF , and the maximum value of 50% appeared at Pm - ffDPP - based device. It is clear that J sc appeared to have the greatest influence on the device performance , so PCEs showed a similar trend as the J sc : PDPP > monofluorinated polymers > difluorinated polymers. The fluorination of DPP units leads to more twisted dihedral angles between the phenyl units and DPP cores , which further blocks interchain interactions. This should be the major reason for the reduced device performances. It was interesting to note that meta-fluorinated polymers exhibited slightly higher PCEs than that of ortho-fluorinated polymers. This may be partially ascribed to the increased backbone coplanarity and red - shifted absorption as discussed above. We tried to optimize devices by adding 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) additive. However , the resultant devices showed an even lower PCE values. Details can be found in Table S2 . The crystalline properties of pure polymer and polymer : PC71BM blends were investigated by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction ( GIXD ).

The variation of domain size of the blend films correlate well with J sc . And the domain size followed an opposite order to the J sc : unfluorinated polymer < monofluorinated polymers < difluorinated polymers. However , it was also found that the meta-fluorinated polymers - based blend films exhibited larger domain spacing than that of the ortho-fluorinated polymers ; i.e. , the domain spacing were 251 and 180 nm for Pm - fDPP and Po - fDPP , and 483 and 393 nm for Pm - ffDPP and Po - ffDPP , respectively. This result counters the J sc trend , where meta-fluorinated polymers exhibited slightly higher J sc than that of ortho-fluorinated polymers. This can be the reason that meta-fluorinated polymers have a better structure order and thus better transport properties can be achieved. In the DIO-processed blend films ( Fig. 8b ) , all the blend films showed dual scattering peaks , and an additional scattering peak at 0.0012 A -1 was observed , which indicated that a larger domain distribution of ~ 524 nm existed in these additive - processed films.

Compared with reported thiophene / pyridine-flanked DPP , thiophene / benzothiophene-flanked DPP polymers exhibited narrower band gaps below 1.5 eV , leading to broadened absorption ranging from 500 nm to 850 nm. All polymers displayed promising ambipolar semiconducting properties. PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT showed hole mobilities of 1.20 , 1.68 and 1.50 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. Their corresponding electron mobilities were 0.40 , 0.14 and 0.35 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Interestedly , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT also showed ambipolar properties in organic solar cells. Photovoltaic device based on PBTTDPP-TT as donor material reached a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.96% with PC71BM as an acceptor , while this device as the acceptor material achieved 0.28% with poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) as the donor. By contrast , PCE of PBTTDPP-2FBT - based devices reached 5.62% with PC71BM and 0.44% with P3HT. These results suggest that adoption of asymmetric flankers in DPP polymers can effectively tune their ambipolar transporting properties for high - performance organic electronic devices . Organic solar cells ( OSCs ) , which can supply clean and low - cost energy and are versatile in complex surroundings , have attracted much attention. 1-3 1-3 1-3 Power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) with polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors have been reported to reach above 11% . [4][5][6] However , the disadvantages of fullerene derivatives are high cost , instability and limited spectral to short wavelength region , are difficult to overcome. The design criterion of a donor molecule , that is , to achieve a low highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) to cater to the energy levels of PC71BM , is difficult to modulate. In addition , donors with low - lying HOMO levels contradicts a sufficient LUMO level offset between donors and fullerene derivatives. 7 Exploitation of non-fullerene molecular acceptors , such as ITIC and its derivatives , delivered the highest power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of OSCs. These studies suggest non-fullerene acceptors present promising alternative for future OSC devices. [8][9][10][11] OSCs based on polymer donors and ITIC - derivative acceptors have exhibited PCEs of more than 13% . [8][9][10][11] The design and synthesis of new nonfullerene polymer acceptors is another strategy towards all - polymer solar cells , which is more competitive in processing properties and thermal stability. [15][16][17] Electron mobility is a critical parameter of polymer acceptors , 3 whilst polymers with ambipolar transport properties could lead to unique exciton and charge transport process. Osaka et al. and Li et al. reported that polymers with building blocks of dithienylthienothiophenebisimide and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) could be versatile as donor or acceptor in OSCs. This finding uncovered ambipolar polymer could fulfill both as acceptor or donor in OSCs.",

    "sentence": "12,13 However , studies on polymers with ambipolar properties are less - progressed for a better understanding of the roles of these polymers in OSCs. DPP - based polymers have been widely studied in OFETs and OSCs because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and exceptional exciton / charge mobilities. [14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The broad absorption range of DPP - based polymers can facilitate an effective absorption of the low energy photons , which would enhance the value of short circuit current J sc in OSCs . λ onset a ) [nm] E H b ) [eV] E L exp c ) [eV] E g exp d ) [eV] E H cal e ) [eV] E L cal f ) [ eV HOMOs of -4.73 , -5.09 and -5.29 eV , respectively , and their corresponding LUMOs were estimated to be -3.34 , -3.63 and -3.83 eV using the optical band gaps ( in Table 1 ) measured from the onset of thin - film absorption. Moreover , PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT exhibited narrower band gaps ( ca. 1.46 eV ) than PPyDPP-BT ( ca. 1.54 eV ). The appropriate HOMO / LUMO levels of PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT combining the narrow band gaps may enable these polymers to behave as promising ambipolar semiconductors for high - performance optoelectronic devices. Moreover , the LUMO of PBTTDPP-2FBT is extremely close to that of PC71BM which is not ideal for charge transfer. Detailed physicochemical characteristics and molecular weights for PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT are summarized in Table 1. respectively. The significant difference in charge carrier mobilities for PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT is strongly related to their diverse effect of molecular structures , leading to the distinct molecular crystallinity and film morphology. Their distinct characteristics are also reflected by their OSC performance as follows . The LUMO / HOMO levels of PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT verify that these polymers are promising ambipolar copolymers with relatively high electron and hole 2 and 3 , respectively. The inappropriate match of LUMO with PC71BM could be a contributing factor for the reduction in J sc for PBTTDPP-2FBT - based PSCs , similar to those of PPyDPP-TT - based PSCs. 24 This phenomenon suggest that the very narrow band gap materials ( ca. 1.30 - 1.45 eV ) can not act as donor successfully with fullerene derivatives if their energy levels can not be matched effectively . Grazing incidence wide - angle X-ray scattering ( GIWAXS ) was performed on the blended polymer films to investigate the molecular stackings and orientations of the active layers of PBTTDPP-BT , PBTTDPP-TT and PBTTDPP-2FBT in the devices ( Figure 5 ). The polymers were compared using Gaussian fit model as a guideline for a broad comparative analysis. The full width at half maximums ( FWHMs ) of the ( 100 ) diffraction Further studies should be performed to achieve better phase separation. Ensuring a more ideal match between the donor and acceptor would increase the PCEs of polymer / fullerene PSCs and all - polymer solar cells .",

Recent interests in polymer semiconductors are motivated by their potential application in large - area and roll - to - roll organic electronics like organic thin - film transistors ( OTFT ) and organic photovoltaics ( OPV ). 1,2 Molecular engineering of polymers allows for the adjustment of photo / electrochemical properties , solubility , packing , morphology of thin film and thus achievement of high performance. 3,4 The common structural feature of these polymer semiconductors is alternating electron - rich ( donor ) and electron - deficient ( acceptor ) units linked along polymer chains. 5,6 Over the years , great efforts have been given to the search of efficient donor or acceptor units and the combination between these units. Impressive power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of > 8% in OPV [7][8][9] and remarkable mobility of > 10 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 in OTFT [10][11][12] have been achieved by incorporating attractive units , such as benzodithiophene , diketopyrrolopyrrole , benzothiodiazole , isoindigo and arylene diimides , etc. Among these remarkable works on OPV devices , cosolvents , small - molecule additives , and post-treatments , such as thermal annealing and solventvapour annealing , have been proved useful strategies to improve microstructure of blend films. Unfavourably , these additional processes increase fabrication cost and are unable to fulfill commercial requirements. Therefore , the development of new building blocks with excellent properties both in photonics and electronics , as well as a simple fabrication process , is still a major challenge for material chemists. 13 Recently , we have paid much attention to the quinacridone ( QA ) units. It is a five - ring planar structure and widely used as the magenta toner with excellent stability. [14][15][16][17] That the nitrogen atoms can be functionalized with alkyl groups make it possible using in photoelectrical devices via solution processibility. However , to the best of our knowledge , only numerable works are reported in the field of OTFT 18,19 and OPVs 15,[20][21][22][23][24] based on this unit. In our group , we have reported polymer PQBOC8 containing QA and benzothiodiazole , 25 although the effective conjugation is limited along polymer backbone , this polymer still exhibited reasonable hole mobility in OFET and high PCE in OPV , simultaneously. 23 Moreover , the crystalline ultra-thin film of this polymer showed high photoresponsivity. 26 These encouraging results indicate that QA would be a promising building block for semiconducting polymers. Nevertheless , the mobilities of all these reported QA - based polymers are relative low because of large π-π stacking distance ( ~ 4 Å ).",

    "sentence": "27 On the other hand , despite using additives or post-treatment methods , the PCE of QA - based polymers is still limited to 2-3 % . 24,27 Therefore , rational design of polymer backbone for QA - based polymers is urgently needed for further advancement in optoelectronic performance. On the basis of above consideration , we firstly introduce vinylene linkage into QA - containing polymer , namely PQTE. In view of its rigid and transconfiguration , thienylene-vinylenethienylene in polymer PQTE is expected to result in much planar configuration and strong interchain interaction. 28,29 For comparison , polymer PQ2T containing QA and bithiophene was also synthesized. As a result , the introduction of vinylene linkage improves not only the crystallinity of thin films but also the miscibility with PC71BM. In OTFTs , PQTE film exhibited a short π-π stacking distance of 3.49 Å and high mobility up to 0.67 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . In solar cell , as donor material , PQTE exhibited PCE up to 3.9% because of the better miscibility with PC71BM than that of PQ2T though PQTE showed stronger intermolecular interaction. It is noteworthy that the PCE of PQTE is among the highest performance for QA - based polymers even though these devices were fabricated without any additives or post-treatments . The absorption spectra of two polymers both in dilute chloroform solution and in solid state are show in Fig. 1 and relevant data are summarized in Table 1. Compared with PQ2T , acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s^-1 . PQTE showed red - shift absorption both in solution and thin film owing to extended π-conjugation induced by integration of vinylene linkage. For PQ2T , the maximum absorption peak was featureless and no obvious spectral shift was observed in solid state compared with that in dilute solution , indicating the polymer might form pre-aggregates in solution. 31 In the case of polymer PQTE , the maximum absorption profile was significantly sharper and there was a prominent shoulder peak at longer wavelength ( ~ 499 nm ). Moreover , the shoulder peak became much finer and stronger in thin film , which demonstrates that vinylene linkage in PQTE lead to much strongly aggregate in solid state. However , a slightly bathochromic shift ( ~ 10 nm ) was observed going from solution to thin film for PQTE which was also observed in other polymers. 32 Density - functional theory ( DFT , B3LYP / 6-31G ) was performed to model the electron density distributions of two trimers , as shown in Fig. S4. From their highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) , we can observe that QA unit exhibited weak electro-deficient character and HOMO is not delocalized over the whole backbone. 19 This is consistent with the fact that the weak shoulder peaks at around 550-630 nm can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ).",

    "sentence": "Because of weak electrodeficient character of quinacridone unit , the reduction curves can not be determined , only oxidation curve are provided in Fig. 1b. The HOMO levels of PQTE and PQ2T calculated from the To probe how the incorporation of vinylene linkage affects the charge transport of PQTE , bottom-gate / top - contact transistors were fabricated with channel length of 30 µm and channel width of 500 µm. The insulator was 300 nm SiO 2 layer passivated with octyltrichlorosilane ( OTS ). Polymer solution was heated and stirred at 80 °C for 5 hours before spin - coated on the substrate. The film thickness was about 35-40 nm. All films were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. Au was used as source and drain electrodes by vacuum deposition. Fig. 2 shows the typical output and transfer curves of FETs based on two polymers. Carrier transport performances are summarized in Table 2. PQTE based FETs exhibit a maximum hole mobility as high as 0.67 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with the average value of 0.54 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and high on / off ratio ( I on / I off ) of 10^-6 -10^-7 . This value is the highest mobility reported so far for quinacridone - based polymers. For PQ2T - based FETs , the highest mobility is calculated to be 0.30 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with the average value of 0.28 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and I on / I off of 10^-6 -10^-7 , which is slightly higher than reported value by Kazuo Takimiya group. We attribute this enhancement to the lower PDI of PQ2T in our work. Smaller threshold voltages ( V T ) are also observed for PQTE devices ( -9.8 V ) than those of PQ2T devices ( -12.0 V ). The high mobility and low V T of TFTs based on PQTE are perhaps due to the preferable orientation of PQTE film . To shed light on the structural effect by introduction of vinylene linkage into PQTE , geometry optimization and molecular ordering were determined by DFT and twodimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction ( 2D-GIXRD ) , respectively. The dihedral angle in PQTE trimers is slightly smaller than that of PQ2T trimmers suggesting better coplanar structure in PQTE ( Fig. S4 ). Comparing the XRD pattern of two polymer films , as shown in Fig. 3 , both polymer PQTE and PQ2T show ( h00 ) diffractions up to the fourth order indicating these polymers are long-range-ordered. However , large arcing diffraction of PQ2T suggested that there is no preferential orientation in the film which is consistent with the reference 19. In contrast , the film of PQTE shows much centralized points along q z axis and distinctly observable ( 010 ) diffraction along q xy axis. The results indicate that the film of PQTE formed preferentially ordered edge-on orientation on the substrate.",

Moreover , the presence of ( h00 ) peaks corresponding to lamellar structure further confirms that both face-on and edgeon orientations exists in this polymer film. Tapping - mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) further demonstrated the difference of morphology between two polymers ( Fig. S5 ). PQTE film exhibit uniform intertwined fibre structures with obviously crystalline zones , which is the result of strong intermolecular interaction. In contrast , PQ2T film shows nodule - like morphology with relatively loose packed grains. According to the result mentioned above , it is confirmed that the insert of vinylene linkage shortens the π-π stacking distance of adjacent polymer chains because of good planarity and extended π-conjugation of vinylene linkage. Strong interchain interaction improves the crystallinity of PQTE film. These observations are in good agreement with the mobility analysis . Bulk heterojuction solar cells were fabricated by employing PQTE or PQ2T as an electron donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor. The typical device configuration is ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al. J-V curves of the optimized photovoltaic devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra are displayed in Fig. 4b. The solar cell parameters are collected in Table 3 and Table S2. The optimum polymer : PC71BM ratio was found to be 1 : 2. The blend solution was spin coated in chlorobenzene at 1000 rpm for 30 s. The thickness of active layer is about 100-115 nm. Note that no processing additives were used at the time of spin coating. Even without any post-treatment , the highest PCE for PQTE was 3.90% with a J sc of 9.74 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.73 V and a modest FF of 55% . For PQ2T , the devices exhibited a moderate PCE of 2.71% with a slightly increase in V oc ( 0.74 V ) and FF ( 56% ) but lower J sc of 6.95 mA cm^-2 compared with PQTE - based devices. It is noteworthy that PCE of 3.90% is among the highest efficiency reported for quinacridone - based polymers via simple device architecture without any additives or post-treatments , which are unique properties of PQTE. In Fig. 4b , high photo - to - current responses were obtained in the range from 350 to 600 nm for two polymer / PC71BM blend films. For PQTE - based devices , the higher response verified higher J sc value which supports the results from J-V characteristics . The morphology of active layers was examined by bright field transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and AFM , respectively. In Fig. 5a , well distributed nano-fibrillar structures are observed in PQTE / PC71BM blend film. This interpenetrating network is beneficial for charge dissociation.",

    "sentence": "35 For PQ2T - based device , macrophase separation limits the probability of exciton dissociation leading to poor J sc ( Fig. 5b ). Additively , the results of AFM images ( Fig. S6 ) reveal that the grains in PQTE / PC71BM blend film are fairly homogeneous in size and shape. However , the PQ2T / PC71BM blend film shows large aggregates and the size is about 200-300 nm , indicating the poor dispersion of PC71BM in the polymer matrix. We note that pure film of PQTE shows a higher degree of crystallinity and order than film of PQ2T. What 's more , the polymer chains are closer than those of PQ2T. However , PQTE unexpectedly exhibits better miscibility with PC71BM while PQ2T / PC71BM blend film is apt to aggregate into large domains. This result could be explained by using DFT calculation and the experimental data collected from 2D-GIXRD of blend films. In blend films , thiophene-vinylene-thiophene ( TVT ) or bithiothene ( BT ) as donor unit in polymers backbone would interact with electro-deficient PC71BM via electrostatic interaction. In consideration of the length of donor units ( Fig. 5c ) , TVT unit with a length of 9.0 Å is larger than the size of PC71BM ( 7.2 ~ 8.0 Å ) , 36 which provides enough volume to accommodate the fullerene molecules. In contrast , short BT unit ( 6.5 Å ) would expel the fullerene resulting in selfaggregation of polymer chains and large domains of PC71BM. 37 This is further confirmed by the results of 2D-GIXRD. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S3 , in PQTE / PC71BM blend film , the lamellar distance shows 2.5 Å larger than that of in the polymer - only film. The significant increase indicates that PC71BM molecules probably intercalate on the crystal lattice of PQTE because of sufficient volume. 38 In contrast , the lamellar distance of PQ2T / PC71BM blend film exhibits negligible increases of 0.2 Å compared with the polymer - only film suggesting that PC71BM molecules can not intercalate well on PQ2T. As a result , good intercalation of PC71BM into the lamellar structure of PQTE is responsible for this high PCE . We synthesized a novel quinacridone - based polymer , PQTE , containing thiophene-vinylene-thiophene unit. PQ2T without vinylene linkage was also synthesized for comparison. As a result , the incorporation of vinylene linkage can efficiently shorten π-π stacking distance and improve the crystallinity of thin film. In TFTs , strong intermolecular interaction of PQTE enhances the charge carrier mobility up to 0.67 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . In solar cell , high PCE of 3.9% was obtained by using PQTE as donor and PC71BM as acceptor while PQ2T - based devices showed moderate PCE of 2.70% . It is noteworthy that high PCE were obtained without any additives or post-treatments. Better miscibility was observed in PQTE / PC71BM blend film compared with that of PQ2T / PC71BM blend film although strong interchain interaction existed in polymer PQTE.",

Semiconducting polymers have attracted considerable interests as the electron - donating materials in organic photovoltaics ( OPVs ) due to their specific merits of light - weight , cost - effective processing on the basis of flexible substrates. Remarkable progress in new - conjugated polymers enables the bulk - heterojunction polymer / fullerene OPV to attain the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) above 10% . [1][2][3] The basic requirements of the high performance conjugated polymers by virtue of high PCE involve the appropriated energy levels , narrow optical band gaps along with high absorptivity , as well as the high charge carrier mobility. 4 Traditional molecular design strategy of suchconjugated polymers concerns the combination of an electron - rich ( donor , D ) and an electron - poor ( acceptor , A ) moieties in an alternating push - pull fashion along the polymer chain , where the e n e r g y l e v e l s o f D -A s k e l e t o n c a n h y b r i d i z e t o g i v e t h e extraordinary narrow band gaps. [5][6][7][8][9] Of particular interest of this molecular framework is the easily tunable molecular structures and the substitutions of either donor or acceptor units , which allow for the access of tunable optical band gaps along with the precisely tailored frontier molecular orbital energy levels. While straightforward in practice , only limited number of donor or acceptor building blocks for polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have been successful in achieving high performances. [10][11][12] Recently , an alternative molecular design strategy of ternary copolymers has emerged for the construction of conjugated polymers with specific optoelectronic properties. 13,14 This strategy 45 comprises the incorporation of an additional donor or acceptor component with an appropriate molar ratio into the D-A type of the polymer backbone , which allows for the integration of the merits of different moieties to attain delicately manipulated properties. 15,16 Regarding to the alternating binary D-A counterparts , such 50 ternary copolymer backbone that containing ternary components can lead to obviously extended absorption profiles , which is favorable for the photoactive layer to harvest sunlight. 17 In this respect , a range of conjugated ternary copolymers containing different building blocks with appropriate donor / acceptor ratios 55 have been developed and demonstrated impressive photovoltaic performance on account of the relatively high short circuit current densities.",

    "sentence": "13,[15][16][17] On the other hand , one notes that the variation in the distribution sequences of different components can provide the 60 randomly arranged backbone , which accordingly gives rise to the numerous possible chromophores with complicated hybridization of molecular orbitals and less favorable -stacking of molecular backbones. 17,18 These effects may also result in unanticipated trap sites and suppressed charge carrier transportation. 19 In this respect , ternary copolymers with regular organization of donor / acceptor moieties along the backbone are highly appreciated owing to their well - defined architectures , which can offer precise electronic structures together with the tendency of forming orderedstacking structures. 14,15 To address this point , Wang et al. proposed and developed the D-A1-D-A2 type of regularly alternating ternary copolymer on the basis of thiophene as the donor unit and two electron - deficient quinoxaline and isoindigo as the acceptor units , which exhibited slightly broader absorption spectra due to better stacking in solid state and obviously enhanced device performance with respect to its random counterpart. 20 Chen et al. demonstrated that the regular ternary copolymers based on thiophene alternating with phenanthrocarbazole and benzothiadiazole exhibited superior photovoltaic performances to the random analog. 21 Very recently , Janssen et al. also compared the random and regular ternary copolymers comprising diketopyrrolopyrrole and thienopyrrolodione and bithiophene , and realized that the randomization of the electron - deficient units along the polymer chain has a negative effect on the photovoltaic performances. 19 Given the aforementioned beneficial photovoltaic performances that the regularly alternating ternary copolymers can offer , here we proposed a series of regular conjugated ternary copolymers that consisting ternary components , with the repeating units denoted as D1-A-D2-A. These ternary copolymers were constructed by copolymerizing a Br-A-D2-A-Br type of dibromointermediate with a bistannyled-D1 monomer , where the benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole ( BT ) and dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]silole ( DTS ) were employed as the acceptor ( A ) and donor ( D2 ) unit , respectively , and several electron - donating cyclopentadithiophene ( CDT ) or benzodithiophene ( BDT ) derivatives were used as the D1 unit. The variation of the electron - donating behaviors and substitutions of the D1 unit exhibited significant influences in the optical properties , electrochemical properties and the photovoltaic performances . The UV - vis profiles of all copolymers in dichlorobenzene solution with a concentration of 1 × 10^-5 g mL -1 and as thin films ( spin - casted from o-dichlorobenzene solutions ) are shown in Fig. 2. All these ternary copolymers illustrate typical dual absorption features of D-A type of conjugated polymers both in solution and as thin films , where the high energy absorbance band located in the range of 300^450 nm is originated from the * transition of polymer backbones , while the low energy absorbance peaked at 690^713 nm with relatively strong intensity could be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) effects between the donors and the accepter moieties.",

    "sentence": "In dilute 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( o-DCB ) solution , PBDT-T-ADA exhibited slightly red - shifted ICT absorbance with the maximum absorption at 713 nm relative to that of 690 nm for PBDT-O-ADA , which may arise from the stronger electron - donating properties of the thienyl groups than the alkoxyl substitution. 27 Compared to the absorption profiles in dilute odichlorobenzene ( o-DCB ) solutions , all polymers exhibit much broader absorbance as thin films owing to the increased intermolecular interactions. It is recognized that the absorption of PCDT - ADA centered at about 700 nm is slightly hypsochromic shifted along with the obviously broadened absorbance in the lowenergy band relative to that of in dilute o-DCB solution , which may be attributed to the increased interactions of the various segments. We note that the absorption profile of PCDT - ADA , with repeating unit of CDT-BT-DTS-BT , is essentially bathochromic shifted comparing to the peak absorption located at about 672 nm for DTS-BT based alternating copolymer. 28 Analogous trend can also be realized for copolymers based on BDT derivatives as D1 unit. It is also worth pointing out that PCDT - ADA exhibits slightly redshifted absorbance relative to the copolymers based on BDT derivatives , which can be attributed to the stronger electrondonating properties of CDT than the BDT unit and the tendency of forming -stacking as thin films. This observation agrees with other reported D-A type of conjugated polymer systems that are based on CDT / BDT derivatives as the electron - donating units and BT as the electron - accepting unit. 22,28,29 The optical band gaps ( Eg opt ) of the resulting ternary copolymers as estimated from the onset of the absorbance of thin films are in the range of 1.49^1.61 eV . It is assumed that the redox potential of Fc / Fc + has an absolute energy level of -4.80 eV to vacuum.

The slopes of the J 1 / 2 -V curves of these ternary copolymers were extracted by modeling the dark current in 50 the SCLC region ( Fig. 5 ).

The device based on PCDT - ADA showed a moderate performance with a moderate PCE = 2.80% ( VOC = 0.64 V , JSC = 11.2 mA cm^-2 and FF = 0.39 ) , which may 80 correlate to the unanticipated geminate recombination due to the straight octyl side chain in DTS unit. 36 The replacement of the CDT unit by a weaker electron - donating group of BDT-T moiety provides a nearly unchanged PCE = 2.79% ( VOC = 0.77 V , JSC = 8.78 mA cm^-2 and FF = 0.39 ) for copolymer PBDT-T-ADA. We measurements , the higher JSC of PBDT-O-ADA is likely correlated to the variation in lm morphology. 26,37 The accuracy of the measured JSC values was confirmed by the calculated integration of the EQE with the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum ( Fig. 6b ). It is worth noting that copolymer PCDT - ADA exhibits prolonged response beyond 800 nm , which agrees with the observation of extended absorbance as thin films. Additionally , the PBDT-O-ADA exhibited much higher values in the range of 380-730 nm than copolymer PBDT-T-ADA , which is in good consistence with the higher short circuit current of the former .

    "sentence": "Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on p - type conjugated polymers as donor and n - type fullerene derivatives as acceptor have been intensively studied in recent years for the generation of affordable , clean , and renewable energy. 1 Advantages of the BHJ PSCs include low - cost fabrication of large - area devices , light weight , mechanical flexibility , and easy tunability of chemical properties of the photovoltaic materials. It has been realized that an ideal polymer donor in PSCs should exhibit broad absorption with high absorption coefficient in the visible region , high hole mobility , suitable energy level matching to the fullerene acceptor , and appropriate compatibility with fullerene acceptor to form nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network. All these specific design criteria can offer high values of short - circuit current ( J sc ) , open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and fill factor ( FF ) of the PSCs , all of which are related to the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ). 2,3 One feasible approach toward broadening the visible absorption and tuning the energy levels is to design alternating donor-acceptor ( D-A ) copolymers , in which the orbital mixing of the donor moiety and the acceptor moiety provides a means for narrowing the bandgap and tuning the energy levels of conjugated polymers. 4-16 In such polymers , electron - rich units such as carbazole , 17 benzodithiophene , 18 indacenodithiophene , 19,20 dithieno[3,2-b : 2^0 ,3 0 -d]silole , 21,22 benzobis(silolothiophene) , 23,24 and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ] dithiophene 25 have been developed as donor units , while diketopyrrolo [3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione , 26,27 benzothiadiazole , 28-30 quinoxaline , 31 thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione , 32-35 and their derivatives have been commonly used as electron acceptor units. Among the acceptors , benzothiadiazole is one of the most successfully and widely used acceptors. Replacing of the sulfur atom with nitrogen atom affords benzotriazole ( BTA ) , which can provide an additional advantage of incorporating solubilizing alkyl chains onto the acceptor unit , rather than on the thiophene rings of the polymer. 36 This unique distribution of the alkyl chains allows the polymer backbone to adopt a more planar conformation , which can promote close packing of the polymer chain and increase the hole mobility of the resulting polymer. Along these lines , copolymers of benzotriazole with electrondenoting group of carbazole , 37 fluorene , 38 and benzodithiophene 39,40 have been well developed in the past two years. With the above-mentioned merit in mind , one must aware that the lone pair on the nitrogen atom also weakened the electronacceptor ability of benzotriazole. In the reported BTA - based polymers , the donor units are based on fluorine , carbazole , or benzene fused thiophene structure. Because of the weak electrondonating nature of the benzene units , their copolymers with BTA weak acceptor unit show large bandgap and poorer absorption.",

Among the donor units reported , dithieno-[3,2-b : 2^0 ,3 0 -d]silole ( DTS ) could be an appropriate choice of such strong donor units. Further considering the higher hole mobility and the lower LUMO energy level of the copolymers containing DTS unit , 21,41 here we synthesized two new D-A ABSTRACT : Two new donor-acceptor ( D-A ) copolymers containing dithienosilole ( DTS ) donor unit and benzotriazole ( BTA ) acceptor unit without and with thiophene bridge , PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA , were synthesized to study their structure-property relationships for the application in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). Compared to PDTS - BTA , adding thiophene bridges in PDTS - DTBTA improves planarity and increases effective conjugation of the polymer main chain , which translated into broader and stronger absorption , higher hole mobility , and better photovoltaic performance. Under the illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2 , the PSC based on PDTS - DTBTA / PC 70 BM demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 3.80% , which is significantly improved in comparison with that ( 1.64% ) of the device based on PDTS - BTA / PC 70 BM under the same experimental conditions. copolymers containing DTS donor unit and BTA acceptor unit , PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA ( see Scheme 1 ). The difference of the two polymers is the thiophene bridges between the donor and acceptor units in PDTS - DTBTA. The polymers do show narrower bandgap and broader absorption in the visible region , and PDTS - DTBTA displays further improved absorption. The effect of thiophene bridges on absorption , morphology , mobility , and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers was fully investigated in this paper. ' Synthesis and Thermal Stability. Synthetic routes of the polymers are outlined in Scheme 1. The two copolymers PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction. 42 All the two polymers have good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , toluene , and chlorobenzene. Molecular weights and polydispersity indices ( PDIs ) of the polymers , as shown in Table 1 , are determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration. Molecular weight of the polymers was determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ). The M n 's of PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA were found to be 6.7 x 10^3 and 8.0 x 10^3 g / mol , respectively , with the corresponding polydispersity indices of 2.07 and 1.80. Thermal stability of the polymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure 1.

    "sentence": "This indicates that the copolymers is stable enough for the applications in optoelectronic devices. Optical Properties. Figure 2 shows the absorption spectra of PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA in chloroform solution and in solid film. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. The solution absorption spectra of PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA show similar profile with the absorption maxima at 567 and 575 nm , respectively. The spectral red shift for PDTS - DTBTA solution could be attributed to its planar backbone , benefiting from reduced steric hindrance by insertion of the thiophene bridges. The advantage of adding the thiophene bridges is also revealed by molar extinction coefficient , as shown in Figure 2b. The absorbance per unit thickness of PDTS - DTBTA film at maximum absorption reached 0.6 x 10^-2 / nm , much higher than that ( 0.5 x 10^-2 / nm ) of PDTS - BTA film. Compared to PDTS - BTA , the broader and stronger absorption feature for PDTS - DTBTA is beneficial to its photoharvesting when it is used as donor material in PSCs. The absorption spectra of the polymer films , as also shown in Figure 2b , red - shifted than that of the polymer solutions , which is a common phenomenon due to the polymer main chain aggregation and interactions in the solid film. 43 In addition , there are stronger shoulder peaks in the long wavelength direction of the polymer film absorption spectra , indicating that there exist some ordered structure in the polymer films , which should benefit higher hole mobility and photovoltaic performance of the polymers. 44 The absorption edges of PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA films are at 684 and 696 nm , corresponding to bandgap of 1.81 and 1.78 eV , respectively. Furthermore , the absorption spectra of PDTS - BTA and PDTS - DTBTA films are red - shifted obviously in comparison with that of the D-A copolymers of BTA copolymerized with other weak donor units such as fluorene , 38 carbazole , 37 and BDT. 39,40 The results suggest that enhancing the electron - donating ability of the donor unit to enhance the orbital mixing with the acceptor unit in the D-A copolymers is an effective way for narrowing the bandgap and broadening the absorption of the copolymers. Hole Mobility. Hole mobility of the two copolymers was measured by the space charge limit current ( SCLC ) method , as shown in Figure 3. PDTS - DTBTA with thiophene bridges demonstrated a hole mobility of 1.24 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which is 3 orders higher than that ( 3.06 x 10^-7 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) of PDTS - BTA.

    "sentence": "The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the conjugated polymers are important parameters in determining the V oc and charge transportation efficiency in PSCs , and they can be measured from the onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials of the cyclic voltammograms ( CVs ) according to the following equations : 45 E HOMO = -e(j ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ) and E LUMO = -e(j red + 4.71 ) , where the unit of j ox and j red is V vs Ag / Ag + . Figure 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the two copolymers. The onset reduction potential ( j red ) and onset oxidation potential ( j ox ) of PDTS - BTA are -1.95 and 0.38 V vs Ag / Ag + , respectively , corresponding to LUMO and HOMO energy levels of -2.76 and -5.09 eV , respectively. After introducing the thiophene bridges in PDTS - DTBTA , its LUMO energy level is decreased to -2.81 and its HOMO energy level is slightly upshifted to -5.05 eV , thus leading to a reduced electrochemical bandgap ( E g ec ) of PDTS - DTBTA. In addition , the E g ec values are ca. 0.5 eV larger than the E g opt values , which is probably due to the exciton binding energy of conjugated polymers. 46 The smaller energy difference ( 0.46 eV ) between E g ec and E g opt for PDTS - DTBTA than that ( 0.52 eV ) for PDTS - BTA indicates that PDTS - DTBTA may have smaller exciton binding energy. The onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials and LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the polymers measured are also listed in Table 2 for clear comparison. Theoretical Calculation. To provide further insight into the fundamentals of molecular architecture , molecular simulation was carried out with a chain length of n = 1 at the DFT B3LYP / 6-31G(d) level with the Gaussian 03 program package. 47 To simplify the calculation , only one repeating unit of each polymer was subject to the calculation , with alkyl chains replaced by CH 3 groups. The simulated electron density distributions and the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels along with optimized geometry are shown in Figure 5. When benzotriazole was incorporated into the D-A polymers , one must aware the possible steric hindrance brought by the peripheral H atoms and the incorporated solubilizing alkyl chains , which is more significant than in benzothiadiazole. As shown by the optimized geometry ( Figure 5b ) , the insertion of thiophene bridge can well relieve the steric hindrance between the BTA acceptor unit and DTS donor unit and provide improved planarity and greater conjugation length. Recently studies showed that planarity can provide better HOMO / LUMO orbital overlap , thus enhancing the absorption coefficient , 46 which is consistent with our observed higher molar extinction coefficient in PDTS - DTBTA.",

    "sentence": "In addition , it can be seen from Figure 5 and Table 2 that although discrepancies exist between the calculation and experimental results , the trends of variation in the HOMO and LUMO energies , as well as the energy gaps , are similar. 48 To balance the absorbance and the charge transporting network of the photoactive layer , the weight ratios of copolymer and PC 70 BM were varied from 1 : 0.8 to 1 : 2. Figure 6 shows the J-V curves of the PSCs under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 3. The V oc for the optimized PSC based on PDTS - BTA : PC 70 BM blend was 0.71 V , which is 0.08 V higher than that ( 0.63 V ) of the optimized PSC based on PDTS - DTBTA , benefiting from its lower lying HOMO energy level. The larger V oc difference ( 0.08 V ) than that ( 0.04 eV ) of their HOMO levels difference is due probably to the influence of other factors on the V oc , such as morphology and carrier recombination rate , etc. Also , it worth noting that J sc is strongly affected by the concentration of PC 70 BM in the blend. A higher concentration of PC 70 BM should favor the formation of the interpenetrated networks of the fullerene acceptor , which in turn favors the effective charge separation and charge transportation. Increasing of the PC 70 BM concentration over the weight ratio of 1 : 1 resulted in decrease of the J sc and PCE values of the PSCs , probably due to the reduction of the amount of polymer donor , which results in the reduction of absorption and hole transporting ability of the active layer. Thus , in both cases , a 1 : 1 weight ratio seems to be the optimal ratio to form the interpenetrated networks for effective charge separation and transportation. At the optimal donor / acceptor weight ratio , the PSC based on PDTS - BTA demonstrates a J sc of 5.65 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.71 V , a FF of 0.408 , and PCE of 1.64% . The PSC based on PDTS - DTBTA shows a better photovoltaic performance with J sc of 9.52 mA cm^-2 , V oc of 0.63 V , FF of 0.63 , and PCE of 3.80% . In comparison with PDTS - BTA , the larger molar extinction coefficients of PDTS - DTBTA and higher hole mobility along with slightly better overlap of absorption spectrum with the solar spectrum can account in part for the increase in J sc , as revealed by incident photon to current efficiency ( IPCE ) spectra.",

When 1,8-diiodooctane was used as a solvent additive to optimize the mixing morphology , the maximum power conversion efficiency reached by a polymer solar cell based on PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM was 5.18% , which was slightly higher than that of the benzothiadiazole (BT)-based analogue ( 5.01% ). These results demonstrated the promising effectiveness of benzoselenadiazole as an electron - deficient unit for the design of the donor - acceptor photovoltaic polymers . For the past two decades , solution - processed semiconducting polymers , as important functional materials , have been applied to low - cost printed electronic devices such as polymer lightemitting diodes ( PLEDs ) , field - effect transistors ( FETs ) , sensors , photodetectors , and polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). 1 The polymers can be molecularly engineered to possess suitable optical and electronic properties through synthesis and assembly in the films for the requirements in each type of device. For PSCs application , 2 further improvement on the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) is expected to follow from the development of novel conjugated polymers with higher carrier mobility and broader absorption of the solar spectrum , especially in the red and near - infrared regions. 3 It has been well demonstrated that the utilization of electron - donating ( D ) and electron - accepting ( A ) building blocks in the polymer backbone is one of the most promising and attractive strategies for designing organic semiconducting polymers. The absorption spectra and energy levels of D-A type polymers can be modulated by adjusting the contribution of intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ). 4 Because many kinds of electron - rich building blocks contain thiophene unit , a simple method to tune the properties of the polymers is replaced the sulfur ( S ) atom in thiophene with a selenium ( Se ) atom. Se atom is much larger in size and less electronegativity compared with the S atom , and thus Secontaining polymers are expected to be more effective in extending the absorption spectrum toward the infrared region. In addition , the Se - containing unit is more polarizable than the S analogue ; thus , the interchain Se°°°Se interactions could improve charge mobility of the polymers. The red - shifted absorption spectrum and higher charge carrier mobility should contribute to higher photovoltaic performance. In fact , some Se - containing electron - rich building blocks , such selenophene , 5 benzodiselenophene , 6 and selenolo[3,2-b]thiophene , 7 have been used in the design of semiconductor polymers and show higher FET mobility and promising photovoltaic performance. On the other hand , for electron - deficient building blocks , the effect of the substitution of S with Se has been investigated less extensively.",

    "sentence": "4,7-Dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) unit has been used as electron - deficient unit and copolymerized with many types of donor segments. 8 When applied to PSCs , polymers based on DTBT and carbazole units show a maximum PCE of 7.1% . 9 However , when 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole (DTBSe)-based polymers , where S is changed to Se in DTBT , were used in PSCs , the photovoltaic performance was disappointing , 10 and the maximum PCE reached only 2.5% . 10d Thus , it is still necessary to develop novel BSe - based polymers and compare the properties of DTBT and DTBSe - based D-A type copolymers in detail. In this study , we chose benzodithiophene ( BDT ) 11 as the electron - donating building block and synthesized PBDT- DTBSe , a new copolymer of the D-A type. To make a clear comparison and elucidate the relationship between properties and structure when a S atom is replaced with a Se atom , the corresponding polymer based on DTBT and BDT was also synthesized and characterized in parallel ( Scheme 1 ). The basic properties of PBDT - DTBT and PBDT - DTBSe , such as their respective absorbance , energy levels , crystalline structures , and charge mobility in the films , were compared , and the potential of DTBSe as a building block for photovoltaic polymers was investigated. The absorption spectra of PBDT - DTBSe in CHCl 3 and in film , together with those of PBDT - DTBT , are shown in Figure 1. In CHCl 3 solution , PBDT - DTBSe showed two main absorption bands with maxima at 446 and 673 nm , while PBDT - DTBT exhibited two peaks at 425 and 630 nm. The peak at the longer wavelength can be attributed to the ICT transition , and the other was possibly the result of higher energy transitions. Both polymers exhibit the similar absorption coefficients ( ∼ 3.8 × 10^4 L mol^-1 cm^-1 ) in the CHCl 3 solutions at their absorption maxima. In films , the peaks of maximum ICT absorption were at 680 nm for PBDT - DTBSe and 646 nm for PBDT - DTBT , which were red - shifted by 7 and 16 nm , respectively , compared with those in CHCl 3 solution. The optical band gaps of the PBDT- DTBSe and PBDT - DTBT film were estimated as 1.55 and 1.72 eV from the absorption onset ( 800 and 720 nm ). These results indicate that replacing a sulfur atom with a selenium atom is a simple way to red - shift the absorption spectra of BTcontaining D-A type polymers to the long - wavelength region. 12 Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was performed to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDT - DTBSe and PBDT - DTBT.",

    "sentence": "The CV curve was recorded by using a Ag / Ag + electrode as a reference , which was calibrated against the redox potential of ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) , whose ionization energy was assumed to be 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The CV curves are shown in Figure 2. Based on the onset values of oxidation potentials ( 0.38 and 0.46 V ) of the polymers , the HOMO energy levels of PBDT - DTBSe and PBDT - DTBT were calculated to be -5.18 and -5.26 eV , respectively. The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the onset values of the reduction potentials , namely -3.48 eV for PBDT - DTBSe and -3.50 eV for PBDT - DTBT. The higher - lying HOMO of PBDT - DTBSe compared with that of PBDT - DTBT resulted in decreasing the V OC of PSC , since V OC of the devices shows a primary correlation with the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the fullerene acceptor. Crystalline Structures and Hole Mobility. X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) measurements were carried out to understand the crystalline structures and molecular orientations of the polymers in solid state. Thin films were spin - coated on Si / SiO 2 substrates from a CB solution. As shown in Figure 3a , in the out - of - plane measurement , the XRD pattern of PBDT - DTBSe revealed a large diffraction peak at 4.3 ° , with a small peak at 8.5 ° , which can be assigned to the ( 100 ) and ( 200 ) diffractions of a layered structure. However , the in-plane measurement revealed only ( 010 ) diffraction due to intermolecular π-π stacking. The interlayer and interchain stacking distances of PBDT - DTBSe were calculated as 2.05 and 0.372 nm , respectively , while PBDT - DTBT showed an XRD pattern similar to that of PBDT - DTBSe , but with a shorter interchain stacking distance of 0.363 nm. The above results indicate a high degree of crystallinity for PBDT - DTBSe and PBDT - DTBT in the film , with the bulky side chains oriented vertically with respect to the substrate , while intermolecular π-π stacking is parallel to the substrate , as schematically shown in Figure 3b ( edge-on orientation ). Replacing a S atom with a Se atom seems to have minimal impact on the molecular orientations of the polymers , only slightly increasing the intermolecular π-π stacking distance. The high degree of crystallinity of PBDT - DTBSe and PBDT - DTBT in the films suggests a high hole mobility , which is an important requirement for effective photovoltaic polymers. The mobility was measured by using field - effect transistors ( FETs ) with a bottom-gate , top - contact device configuration built on n - doped silicon wafers. Figure 4 shows the typical transfer curves of both polymers.",

The threshold voltages for both polymers are -12 and -22 V , respectively. This increase of hole mobility by replaced S atom with Se atom was also found in other D-A type polymers. 5-7 Although the FET mobility might not be directly correlated to the photovoltaic performance since the situation of the charge transport is quite different from each other , the 2 times higher hole mobility of PBDT - DTBSe than that of PBDT - DTBT could suggest more effective charge transport to the electrodes in the bulk - heterojunction solar cells. Photovoltaic Properties. The photovoltaic properties of PBDT - DTBSe and PBDT - DTBT were investigated in BHJ solar cells with [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) as the acceptor. PSCs were fabricated with a typical sandwich structure of glass / ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / Ca / Al. The ratio of the polymer to PC 70 BM was optimized as 2 : 1 , 1 : 1 , and 1 : 2 , and the devices with a ratio of 1 : 1 showed the highest performance. Figure 5 shows the J-V curves of the devices with the highest photovoltaic performance under AM1.5 illumination ( 100 mW cm^-2 ). The corresponding V OC , short - circuit current ( J SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and PCE of the devices are also summarized in Table 1. For the PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM system , using pristine CB as a processing solvent , only moderate PCE of 3.23% was achieved , mainly due to the moderate J SC of 8.84 mA cm^-2 . Since J SC generally depends on the mixing morphology of the films , the film surface morphology was observed by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). As shown in Figure 6 , large domains can be seen in the blend film processed from pristine CB , which indicates that the nonoptimal nanoscale structure and the large phase separation lowers the charge separation and transport. It has been shown in many studies that a small amount of 1,8diiodooctane ( DIO ) can drastically enhance the interpenetrat - ing nanoscale morphology , thus improving the PCE of PSCs for polymer / fullerene systems.",

    "sentence": "13 Therefore , we added DIO to the PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM system , in which the active layer spin - coated from a CB / DIO blend presented a more favorable morphology , as expected ( Figure 5 ). The observed DIO effects on morphology are attributed to the selective solubility of DIO to fullerene. As a result , with the introduction of DIO , 3 vol % , in CB , the V OC decreased slightly , but J SC and FF improved substantially , resulting in a higher PCE of 5.18% . It is noteworthy that both the PCE and J SC ( 13.58 mA cm^-2 ) of the PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM system are the highest for any BSe - containing polymer reported thus far. For PSCs based on PBDT - DTBT / PC 70 BM , a PCE of 5.01% was achieved simply by using pure DCB as a processing solvent , and AFM images revealed that a smooth film has been achieved ( Figure 6 ). As expected , using DIO as an additive did not entail any further improvement in performance for PBDT - DTBT / PC 70 BM systems. Figure 7 shows plots of the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the photovoltaic devices under monochromatic light illumination. For PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM , the shapes of the EQE curves of the devices spin - coated from pure CB and CB / DIO blend ( 97 / 3 v / v ) solutions are similar , but the latter exhibits higher values. The highest EQE values of the two plots are 0.47 and 0.68 , respectively. For PBDT - DTBT / PC 70 BM , the maximum response of EQE is similar to that of PBDT- DTBSe ( 0.65 at 400 nm ) , but the response extends only to 720 nm , which is shorter than that of the PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM system by ca. 80 nm. This should be the cause of the lower J SC under irradiation with simulated solar light. The J SC calculated from the integral of EQE curves and AM 1.5 spectrum are 13.28 and 10.90 mA cm^-2 for PBDT - DTBSe and PBDT- DTBT , respectively , which are consistent with the experimental J SC values under the simulated solar light ( match within 2% ) . We synthesized a novel BSe - based copolymer with a low band gap. The slightly higher photovoltaic performance of PBDT- DTBSe / PC 70 BM compared with PBDT - DTBT / PC 70 BM suggests that BSe is a promising building block for constructing photovoltaic polymers. Furthermore , both the PCE ( 5.18% ) and J SC ( 13.58 mA cm^-2 ) of the PBDT - DTBSe / PC 70 BM system are the highest for any BSe - containing polymer reported thus far.",

The polymer possesses good thermal stability and reasonable solubility. The absorption edge of POTBTV film is at 750 nm , indicating a narrow band gap of 1.65 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of POTBTV are -4.97 eV and -2.99 eV , respectively. The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSC based on POTBTV as the donor PC 70 BM as the acceptor reached 1.53% with a short circuit current density of 6.83 mA cm^-2 , an open circuit voltage of 0.6 V and a fill factor of 0.374 under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 , which is among the highest PCE values for PSCs based on PTV derivatives . In recent years , bulk - heterojunction polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have received considerable attention because of their advantages of low cost , light weight , easy fabrication and compatibility with flexible substrates. 1 The photoactive layer of the PSCs is composed of the blend of a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene derivative ( such as [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 60 BM ) ) acceptor. To increase the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs , the key issue is to design and synthesize high efficiency donor and acceptor materials with broad visible absorption , high charge carrier mobility , and suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels. 2,3 For conjugated polymer donor materials , broad and strong absorption and high hole mobility are very important. Poly ( thienylene vinylene ) derivatives ( PTVs ) possess a broad absorption covering the whole visible region and higher hole mobility , 4 which is attractive for the application as donor materials in PSCs. However , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSCs based on PTVs with alkyl chain as donor is only ca. 0.2 x 0.3% , 5 which is probably due to nonluminescent nature of the polymers. 6 Recently , He et al. synthesized a PTV derivative with D-A structure , ( PTBTV ) ( see Scheme 1 ) , which showed broad absorption and weak photoluminescence ( PL ). The PSC based on PTBTV as the donor demonstrated a PCE of 0.51% , 7 which is obviously improvement in comparison with that of the common PTVs. More interestingly Huo et al. synthesized poly(3-carboxylated thienylenevinylene ) ( P3CTV ) with an electron - withdrawing carboxylate substituent , which possesses a lower HOMO energy level and weak PL. The PCE of the PSCs based on P3CTV as the donor reached 2.01% , which is one order increase compared to the PSCs based on the common PTVs. 8 These results indicate that the photovoltaic performance of the PTV derivatives could be greatly improved by appropriate molecular structure modification.",

POTBTV was designed with two octyloxy chains on the benzothiazole ring to achieve more planar polymer conformation than PTBTV reported by He et al. and increase the dissolution of polymer. The structure of POTBTV is shown in Scheme 1 . The synthesis of the polymer was carried out using palladiumcatalyzed Stille - coupling between monomer 4,7-dibromo-5,6bis(octyloxy)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole and (E)-1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethane , as shown in Scheme 3. The weight average molecular weight of the polymer is 4.5 kg mol^-1 with a PDI of 1.4 , determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ). POTBTV displayed good solubility at elevated temperature in chloroform , 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) , THF , etc. Fig. 1 shows the thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) plot for POTBTV. The onset temperature with 5% weight loss of the polymer is at 330 °C , indicating that POTBTV has good thermal stability for the application in PSCs . The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was performed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the conjugated polymers. 10 Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammogram of POTBTV film on Pt electrode in acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M Bu 4 NPF 6 at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s^-1 . It can be seen that there are reversible p - doping / dedoping ( oxidation / re-reduction ) processes at positive potential range and n - doping / dedoping ( reduction / re-oxidation ) processes at the negative potential range . The surface morphology of the polymer film was investigated by atomic force microscope ( AFM ). The phase image ( see Fig. 3 ) shows a crystalline structure with extensive nanocrystalline domains of parallel rod - like structures. The rod - like structure was likely due to a p-p stacking order composed of face - to - face stacking lamellae with the stacking direction along the length of the rod. This demonstrates that POTBTV is a planar structure. 12 Two octyloxy chains on the benzothiazole Scheme 3 The synthetic route for POTBTV. ( i ) Pd ( PPh 3 ) 4 , toluene , argon , reflux , 12 h.

    "sentence": "The UV - vis absorption spectra of the POTBTV in chloroform solution and as thin film were shown in Fig. 4. The polymer solution in chloroform exhibited broad absorption between 300 and 700 nm , which is the characteristic of the PTV derivatives. 5,7 The maximal absorption of POTBTV solution was at 579 nm. The thin film absorption of POTBTV was broadened and red - shifted in comparison with that of the polymer solution. The absorption maximum of the polymer film was at 618 nm , red - shifted by ca. 39 nm compared to that of the polymer solution , and the absorption edge of the polymer film is at ca. 750 nm corresponding to a bandgap of 1.65 eV. The broad and red - shifted absorption of the polymer film indicates that strong intermolecular interaction and aggregation exist in the solid - state of this polymer. In addition , the absorption spectrum of the polymer film exhibited a welldefined vibronic splitting at 667 nm ( an absorption shoulder ) , which is likely to be because of the high structural order in the thin film. 13 Fig. 5 shows the photoluminescence ( PL ) spectrum of POTBTV solution in chloroform. POTBTV shows photoluminescence in the wavelength range from 600 nm to 800 nm with a peak at ca. 655 nm. The PL emission of POTBTV could be benefited from the thiophene-benzothiadiazole-thiophene unit in the polymer , which is highly important for improving the photovoltaic properties of the PTVs . The photovoltaic property of POTBTV was evaluated in bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cell ( PSCs ). The polymer POTBTV was used as donor and PC 70 BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) was used as acceptor in the active layer of the devices. Fig. 6. shows the I-V curve of the PSC under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . The V oc , I sc and PCE of the device were 0.6 V , 6.83 mA cm^-2 and 1.53% respectively. The PCE of 1.53% is significant improved in comparison with the PSCs based on the PTVs , and it is three times increased than that of the device based on PTBTV with a similar structure. 7 Fig. 7 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) plot of the PSCs based on the POTBTV / PC 70 BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ). It can be seen that the photoresponse curve of the PSC covers a wide wavelength range from 300 nm up to 780 nm , which coincides with the absorption spectrum of the photoactive film. The maximum EQE value of the device based on POTBTV was 38% at ca. 460 nm. The broad coverage of the solar spectrum of the PSC guarantees a high J sc value of the device. These results indicate that poly(thienylenevinylene) derivatives with planar and relatively lower HOMO energy level could be a promising photovoltaic material after further structural modification .",

    "sentence": "Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) are the most promising alternatives to inorganic - based solar cells because of their light weight , flexibility , and large - scale manufacturing with low cost roll - toroll process. 1,2 The introduction of the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) concept has led to intensive research worldwide and rapid development in the field of PSCs. 3,4 The BHJ is formed by blending an electron - rich polymer as a donor and an electrondeficient fullerene derivative as an acceptor. 3,4 Such BHJ not only provides abundant donor-acceptor interfaces for exciton dissociation but also forms an interpenetrating network for free charges transport to collecting electrodes. 3,4 Very recently , power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) higher than 7% has been achieved by several groups , 5-10 which is significant progress in the field. Until now , fullerene derivatives have been proved to be the best and most commonly used electron acceptors. 11,12 Therefore , great efforts have been focused on developing new polymers with narrow band gap and beneficial nanoscale morphology. 5-10,13-19 Opencircuit voltage ( V oc ) and short - circuit current ( J sc ) are two most important parameters determining PCEs of PSCs. V oc is proportional to the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level of a donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of an acceptor , and J sc depends mainly on the LUMO energy level difference between the donor and the acceptor. Empirically , the minimum energy difference of 0.3 eV is required for efficient exicton dissociation. 2,20 Thus , the ideal LUMO energy level of the polymer would be ∼ 3.9 eV , since PCBM possesses a LUMO of 4.2 eV. After years of intensive study , some design criteria for efficient donor materials can be summarized as follows : 21 ( 1 ) with relatively narrow band gap ( the optimal value is about 1.5 eV ) 22,23 to efficiently absorb sunlight for converting into J sc ; ( 2 ) with balanced HOMO and LUMO energy levels for a maximum V oc and minimum LUMO offset to avoid unnecessary energy loss ; ( 3 ) good solubility and appropriate miscibility with fullerene derivatives for solution processing and an optimal nanoscale morphology. On the basis of above rules , various low band gap polymers have been synthesized and utilized in PSCs. 5-10,13-19 9,9-Dialkylfluorene has been used as a building block for constructing donor-acceptor conjugated polymers in PSCs. In 2003 , a low band gap polyfluorene derivative ( PFDTBT ) was first reported as a donor in BHJ solar cells with a PCE of 2.2% . 24 Although PFDTBT - based PSCs demonstrated a considerable V oc of 1 V , the low photocurrent , which maybe result from the low carrier mobility of the polymer , limited the efficiency. Later , PFDTBT polymers carrying different flexible alkyl chains have been studied by several groups , and the PCE was improved to 4.5% .",

    "sentence": "25 Yang et al. found that the bulky side chains at the 9-position sp 3 -hybridized carbon in fluorene unit of PFDTBT hinders π-π stacking of polymer chains in solid film , which impedes carrier transport. 25 ABSTRACT : A novel donor-acceptor copolymer containing 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene unit in the main chain , poly[9-(1 0hexylheptylidene)-2,7-fluorene-alt-5 , 5-(4 0 ,7 0 -di-2-thienyl-5 0 ,6 0dialkoxy-2 0 ,1 0 ,3 0 -benzothiadiazole ) ] ( PAFDTBT ) , has been synthesized and evaluated in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells ( BHJ PSCs ). The polymer possesses a low band gap of 1.84 eV , a low - lying HOMO energy level ( 5.32 eV ) , and excellent solubility in common organic solvents. PSCs based on PAFD - TBT and (6,6)-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) demonstrate a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.2% with a high fill factor ( FF ) of 0.70 , which indicates that 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene can be a very useful building block for constructing narrow band gap conjugated polymers for high - efficiency BHJ PSCs. In order to have high mobility in solid films , the polymer chains are required to closely pack in solid state. On the other hand , lateral flexible side chains are necessary to guarantee the conjugated polymers with desired solubility and processability in common organic solvents. We must make a balance between close packing and good solubility in designing high - efficiency polymer photovoltaic materials. 9-Alkylidene-9H-fluorene has a sp 2 -hybridized carbon at the 9-position as shown in Scheme 1a. Compared with 9,9-dialkyl-substituted fluorene , the 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene unit is inclined to take on a planar conformation , 26 which facilitates the polymer backbones forming close packing in solid state to enhance charge carrier transportation. 26 Here , we demonstrated for the first time that 9-alkylidene-9Hfluorene can be a very useful building block for constructing main chain donor-acceptor alternating narrow band gap conjugated polymers for high - efficiency PSCs. Poly[9-(1 0 -hexylheptylidene)-2,7-fluorene-alt-5,5-(4 0 ,7 0 -di-2-thienyl-5 0 ,6 0 -dialkoxy-2 0 ,1 0 , 3^0 -benzothiadiazole ) ] ( PAFDTBT ) ( Scheme 1b ) has been synthesized and used as a donor in BHJ PSCs. The two hexyl chains on the 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene unit and the two octyloxy chains on the 2^0 ,1 0 ,3 0 -benzothiadiazole unit can provide PAFDTBT good solubility in common organic solvents and will not interfere with the polymer chain packing in solid state. Under simulated solar illumination of AM 1.5G ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) , PCE of 6.2% is achieved in the PSCs composed of PAFDTBT and (6,6)phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ). The devices illustrate a V oc of 0.89 V , a J sc of 9.9 mA / cm^2 , and a considerably high fill factor ( FF ) of 0.70. Such high FF at J sc = 9.9 mA / cm^2 indicates that PAFDTBT with good electric property is a promising donor material for solar cell application.",

    "sentence": "Noticeably , PAFDTBT exhibited much improved PSCs performance when compared with the analogous 9,9-dialkylfluorene - based polymer P1 ( Scheme 1b ) which showed general PSCs performance with PCE of only 3.1% in our previous report. 27 Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) indicated that PAFDTBT is of good stability up to 340 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere , and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) revealed no obvious glass transition for PAFDTBT. The X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) pattern of the powdery sample of PAFDTBT exhibits two peaks as shown in Figure S1 ( see Supporting Information ) ; the first peak with small angel of 4.9 ° indicated the distance of 17.9 Å between polymer backbones separated by alkyl side chains , and the second peak at 21.4 ° showed the formation a π-π distance of 4.1 Å between the polymer backbones. Such a short distance indicates the planar conformation and the close stacking of the polymer backbones in the solid state. 32 Optical and Electrochemical Properties. The absorption spectra of PAFDTBT in chloroform solution and in a film at 20 °C are shown in Figure 1a. In chloroform solution , PAFDTBT displays two absorption bands centered at 380 and 522 nm. In comparison with solution absorption , the absorption peaks in the film are red - shifted to 392 and 571 nm , respectively , and became broader. The red shift that occurs in going from the solution to the film is attributed to the aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state. The onset of the optical absorption of the PAFDTBT film is at 671 nm , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.84 eV. The HOMO energy level is determined by cyclic voltammogram to be at -5.32 eV , and the LUMO energy level of PAFDTBT is calculated to be -3.48 eV according to the HOMO energy level and the optical band gap. Such high LUMO energy level is expected to provide an enough driving force for efficient exciton dissociation. 21 Meanwhile , the low - lying HOMO energy level of PAFDTBT can offer a high V oc when blended with a fullerene derivative as an acceptor. As PAFDTBT has low absorption around 450 nm , PC71BM was chosen as an electron acceptor for the BHJ solar cells to increase light absorption in visible region. 33 As can be observed in Figure 1a , the PAFDTBT / PC71BM BHJ film ( 1 : 3 by weight ) has broad absorption covering the UV-vis range. For the analogous 9,9-dialkyl-9H-fluorenebased polymer P1 , the absorption spectrum in solution shows the maximum absorption bands are 389 and 528 nm , which are almost similar as the absorption peaks of PAFDTBT in solution. However , there is a red shift of only 20 nm when it goes from the solution to the solid state as show in Figure 1b.",

    "sentence": "PAFDTBT shows a larger red - shift ( about 50 nm from the solution to the film state ) than 9,9-dialkyl-9H-fluorene - based P1 , which is attributed to that 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene - based PAFDTBT has a more planar structure and aggregation ( an orderly π-π stacking ) is formed in the solid state. Meanwhile , PAFDTBT possesses a lower optical band gap of 1.84 eV than that of P1 ( 2.04 eV ) deduced from the onset of the optical absorption at 608 nm. 27 The optical properties indicate PAFDTBT is a promising material for solar cell applications. Photovoltaic Properties. The photovoltaic properties of PAFDTBT were investigated by blending PAFDTBT and PC71BM in 1,2-DCB at different weight ratios , different concentration , different spin - coating speeds , and containing different volumes of 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) as a processing additive. The characterization showed that the optimized stoichiometry of PAFDTBT to PC71BM is 1 : 3 by weight , the blend concentration is 28 mg / mL , DIO content is 0.5 vol % in 1,2-DCB , and the spin- Figure 2a shows the typical current density-voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of solar cells under 1 sun of simulated AM 1.5G solar radiation ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). PSCs were first fabricated from the blend of PAFDTBT : PC71BM in 1,2-DCB. In this condition , the best performance was obtained at a weight ratio of 1 : 3 , with V oc = 0.89 V , J sc = 10.5 mA / cm^2 , FF = 0.51 , and an overall PCE of 4.8% . The noticeably feature of PAFDTBT - based solar cells is high V oc , which has been expected from the deep lying HOMO energy levels of PAFDTBT. In addition , almost all devices present comparable parameters with J sc above 10 mA / cm^2 as shown in Figure S2 ( see Supporting Information ). Furthermore , the device performance can be pronouncedly improved with the addition of a small amount ( 0.5 vol % ) of the processing additive DIO. In this condition , PCE of 6.2% was achieved in the champion solar cell with V oc = 0.89 V , J sc = 9.9 mA / cm^2 , and FF = 0.70. It is especially striking that FF was improved 37% with the addition of the additive DIO although V oc is the same as and J sc is almost even up with the PSCs without DIO according to the statistical data in Figure S2. Just as expected , PAFDTBT - based PSCs exhibited higher J sc , especially higher FF than P1 - based PSCs as shown in Figure 2b , 27 which showed PCE of 3.1% with V oc = 0.97 V , J sc = 6.7 mA / cm^2 , and FF = 0.47. The addition of the processing additive DIO can not enhance the photovoltaic performance of P1 - based solar cells. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.",

    "sentence": "Therefore , it can be concluded that 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene as a donor unit presents some advantages over 9,9-dialkyl-substituted 9H-fluorene units. First of all , the alkyl chains on 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene could decrease the steric hindrance compared with 9,9-dialkyl-substituted 9H-fluorene units and also form a planar structure to improve the intermolecular stacking of the polymers , resulting in the improved charge mobility. Further , the extended π-conjugation in the 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene unit will act as a stronger electron - rich donor , resulting in a lower band gap. Third , due to the better crystallinity of PAFDTBT , favorable morphology of the blend film for good photovoltaic performance can be achieved with the help of the additive. The external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) were measured under illumination of monochromatic light. As shown in Figure 3 , a significant photo - to - current response can be observed in nearly the entire visible range of 370-570 nm with EQE value of 50-60 % for both the PAFDTBTbased devices with and without DIO. This high EQE response and high FF of 0.70 also indicate balanced charge transport and improved active - layer morphology due to the addition of DIO. 34 Bottom-gate , top - contact organic field effect transistors ( OFETs ) were fabricated from PAFDTBT and the blend of PAFDTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) to investigate the charge transport property. The hole mobility of the pristine PAFDTBT film spin - cast from 1,2-DCB solution was 1.67 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10^5 . When PAFDTBT film was treated by solvent - assistant annealing at 120 °C for 15 min , 35 the hole mobility was further improved 1 order of magnitude to 1.0 x 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Moreover , the hole mobility of the film spin - cast from the blend of PAFDTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) in 1,2-DCB solution was also investigated , which is 1.40 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The output and transfer characteristic curves of the related OFETs are shown in Figure 4. Significantly , the hole mobility of the film spin - cast from the blend of PAFDTBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) in 1,2-DCB solution was further improved for almost 3 times to 3.93 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with the addition of DIO ( 0.5 vol % ) without further device optimization as shown in Figure 5. The data are summarized in Table S1 ( see Supporting Information ). Hence , the large increase in FF with the addition of DIO was attributed , at least partially , to the increased hole mobility induced by DIO.",

    "sentence": "Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was used to investigate the surface morphology of the blend of PAFDTBT : PC71BM = 1 : 3 in 1,2-DCB with or without the additive DIO , since the morphology of the blend film can largely affect charge separation and transport. 36,37 As shown in Figure 6 , AFM images show the blend film of PAFDTBT : PC71BM = 1 : 3 in 1,2-DCB with or without the additive DIO both possess uniform and finer structures. However , without the additive the surface of the active layers of PAFDTBT : PC71BM is quite smooth , with a root-mean-square ( rms ) of 0.486 nm. Meanwhile , with the addition of DIO ( 0.5 vol % ) , the surface of the active layers become rough , with a rms of 0.735 nm , which suggested larger phase separation is more favorable for charge transport. 36 The increase of surface roughness and the occurring of the phase separation are responsible for the enhancement of FF with the addition of DIO. Without addition of DIO , despite high charge separation efficiency observed by efficient photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching for PAFDTBT ( see Figure S4 in Supporting Information ) , a small fraction of carriers might recombine at donor / acceptor interfaces before reaching the electrodes , since the charge transfer state ( CT ) emission occurred at 850 nm in PL spectra. 38 With addition of DIO , the phase separation of the active layers of PAFDTBT : PC71BM increases , and charge separation efficiency decrease a little as shown by incompleted PAFDTBT PL quenching , but the charge carrier mobility increased and recombination decreased , which resulted in improved FF. The appropriated domain sizes and phase separation can produce the best photovoltaic performance. 4 With the addition of a larger amount of DIO ( 1% and 2% ) , the blend morphology showed strikingly different. The roughness increased a lot and too big phase separation deteriorated photovoltaic performance ( Figure S3 and Table S2 in Supporting Information ). Only 0.5% DIO provided the best performance. This finding highlights that controlling the morphology of the donor / acceptor network is critical to optimize efficiency . A novel 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene containing main chain donor-acceptor type polymer ( PAFDTBT ) has been designed , synthesized , and applied in BHJ PSCs. PCE of 6.2% with V oc = 0.89 V , J sc = 9.9 mA / cm^2 , and FF = 0.70 was achieved in PSCs based on PAFDTBT : PC71BM , which indicates that PAFDTBT is a promising candidate for high - efficiency solar cells. To the best of our knowledge , PAFDTBT is the first 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene - containing low band gap conjugated polymers used for BHJ PSCs. Our research results suggest that 9-alkylidene-9H-fluorene can be a very useful building block for the construction of narrow band gap conjugated polymers for high - efficiency BHJ polymer photovoltaic cells.

    "sentence": "A series of donor - acceptor copolymers based on a new silafluorene containing multifused heptacylic arenes have been designed and synthesized in order to further modulate and optimize their electronic and optical properties. Polymer solar cells based on a blend of these polymers and PC61BM exhibited high open circuit voltages of up to 0.86 V. Through simple and straightforward engineering of molecular structures , the devices based on the PSiFDCTBT : PC61BM ( 1 : 3.5 in wt % ) blend provided , on average , a V oc of 0.86 V , a J sc of 8.8 mA / cm^2 , a FF of 56% , delivering a PCE of 4.2% . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted increased attention due to their potential application toward flexible , large - area , and low - cost photovoltaic devices. 1 Since the introduction of the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) concept , significant efforts have been put forth to improve the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) to meet the criterion of high performance photovoltaic applications. 2 Very recently , efficiencies higher than 8% have been achieved by several groups , which shows great potential for commercialization. 3 To achieve highly efficient PSCs , conjugated polymers with relatively low band gaps , high absorption - coefficients , balanced HOMO and LUMO energy levels , good solubility , and appropriate miscibility with fullerene derivatives in blended active - layers are important prerequisites. Extensive π-conjugation of a rigid polymer backbone will facilitate intermolecular interactions between polymer chains and increase the charge mobility of the polymers. 4 Recently , several ladder - type copolymers have been investigated for achieving efficient PSCs. 5 Specifically , silole - containing semiconducting polymers have been known to exhibit altered properties with respect to their carbon analogues. A variety of functionalized silolecontaining semiconducting polymers have been reported to show promising characteristics as materials for PSCs. 6,7 The silole(silacyclopentadiene) moiety has been investigated as a system where the σ*-orbital of the silicon-carbon bond interacts with the π*-orbital of the butadiene fragment resulting in a lower lying LUMO. 7a The research groups of Yang and Brabec have independently shown that replacing the bridging carbon atom in cyclopenta [2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene containing polymers with silicon helps to increase the crystallinity of the polymers 7b,c providing polymers that have relatively high charge carrier mobilities. 7d Studies have also indicated that these silicon bridged polymers have good environmental stability. 7e In considering the above , we have designed and synthesized a new variety of low bandgap copolymers that contain a multifused thienyl-fluorene-thienyl subunit where the bridging carbon atom on the fluorine has been replaced with a silicon atom. Forced planarization by covalently fastening adjacent aromatic units within the polymer backbone helps to strengthen parallel π-orbital interactions to extend the effective conjugation length and facilitate π-electron delocalization , providing an effective way to reduce the band gap.",

    "sentence": "Moreover , coplanar geometries and rigid structures can suppress rotational disorder around interannular single bonds and lower the reorganization energy , which can in turn enhance intrinsic charge mobilities. 8 In order to further modulate and optimize the electronic and optical properties , exploration of different electron - deficient units incorporated into multifused thienyl-fluorene-thienyl based polymeric backbone is highly desirable. Benzothiadiazole ( BT ) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( PD ) units are widely used electron - deficient units introduced in the D-A copolymers due to their suitable electron affinity and easy synthesis. 9 In addition , diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) has also emerged as a useful acceptor unit because of its planar conjugated bicyclic structure and strong electron - withdrawing nature of polar amide group. 10 On the basis of the modified multifused thienyl-fluorene-thienyl as the core structure , we have successfully synthesized three D-A copolymers , PSiFDCTPD , PSiFDCTBT , and PSiFDCTDPP ( Scheme 1 ). The synthesis , characterization , and photovoltaic applications of these polymers will be discussed . . . As shown in Figure 1a , the absorption spectra of the three polymers in dilute chloroform exhibited two characteristic bands. Each polymer has an absorption band located between 300 and 550 nm with a second broad absorption from 500 to 800 nm. The shorter wavelength absorption can be attributed to the π-π* transition of the heptacylic units , while the lower energy band can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the electron - rich and electron - deficient segments. 11 Compared to PSiFDCTPD , which shows absorption maxima at 535 and 562 nm in solution , PSiFDCTBT exhibited an absorption maximum at 410 nm with a bathochromic shift of the ICT band to 646 nm. PSiFDCTDPP exhibited an absorption maximum at 430 nm with the ICT band at 714 nm. From Figure 1b , the absorption of all the polymers shifted toward longer wavelengths from solution to the solid state , indicating that the planar structure of SiFDCT is capable of inducing strong interchain interactions. The optical band - gaps ( E g opt ) deduced from the absorption edges of the thin film spectra are in the following order : PSiFDCTPD ( 1.88 eV ) > PSiFDCTBT ( 1.76 eV ) > PSiFDCTDPP ( 1.57 eV ). The difference of their absorption maxima as well as E g opt indicates that the acceptor strength is in the order DPP > BT > DP. 12 Note that the intensities of the shorter wavelength bands of the polymer in the solid state are apparently stronger than those in the solution state , which suggests that the rigid and coplanar nonacyclic units can enhance their light absorption ability in the solid state. Theoretical Calculations. To further understand the effect of planarization on the molecular structures and properties , we performed theoretical calculations by density functional theory at the level of B3LYP / 6-31G ( d ).",

Methyl groups were used in the approximation of long alkyl chains in order to reduce calculation time. The optimized structures for PSiFDCTPD , PSiFDCTBT , and PSiFDCTDPP are shown in Figure 2. All three polymers show planar conformations through the entirety of the polymer backbone. The dihedral angles between the acceptor moieties and the neighboring SiFDCT fused - ring are ∼ φ = 0 ° . The frontier orbitals of the model compounds SiFDCTPD , SiFDCTBT , and SiFDCTDPP are shown in Figure 2. The calculated HOMO energy levels of SiFDCTPD , SiFDCTBT , and SiFDCTDPP were -5.54 , -5.72 , and -5.68 eV , respectively , which are in general agreement with the experimentally determined values for the corresponding polymers ( see cyclic voltammetry measurements below ) albeit with a shift of 0.2 - 0.4 eV. For the corresponding alternating dimers , the electron density of the LUMO was primarily located on the electron - accepting unit ( Figure 2d ) , whereas the electron density of the HOMO was more evenly distributed across both the donor and acceptor with the exception of PSiFDCTDPP ( Figure 2c ). This redistribution of electron density shows a pronounced intramolecular charge separation between the donor and acceptor following excitation. The electrochemically determined band gaps were deduced from the difference of the onset oxidation and reduction potentials. The energy levels are summarized in Figure 3. All of the polymers showed one stable and reversible pdoping and n - doping processes , which are important prerequisites for p - type semiconductor materials. The HOMO energy levels were estimated to be -5.31 eV for PSiFDCTPD , -5.32 eV for PSiFDCTBT , and -5.26 eV for PSiFDCTDPP , which are in an ideal range to ensure improved air stability and greater attainable V oc in the final device. The LUMO energy levels are approximately located at -3.63 eV for PSiFDCTPD and -3.71 eV for PSiFDCTBT , which are much higher than the LUMO level of the PC61BM acceptor ( -4.2 eV ) to ensure energetically favorable electron transfer. The hole mobilities of all three polymers prior to blending with PC61BM were similar at around 1.0 × 10^-8 cm^2 / ( V s ). However , after blending with PC61BM , the hole mobilities of the blended films exhibited an improvement in performance several orders of magnitude higher than the pure films. This phenomenon has been reported by others 13 and is most likely due to the intercalation of PC61BM between the polymer side chains , which in turn inhibits coiling of the polymer chains. The planarization of the polymer backbone is said to increase the conjugation length , improves intermolecular interactions , and improves charge mobilities.",

    "sentence": "In Figure 4b , which shows the absorption spectra of the blended films , we see a red - shift in the absorption spectra compared to the pure polymer films ( Figure 4a ) confirming the increased planarity of the polymers upon blending. The hole mobilities of the blended films followed the trend PSiFDCTDPP : PC61BM ( 4.6 × 10^-7 cm^2 / ( V s ) ) < PSiFDCTPD : PC61BM ( 2.5 × 10 - 6 cm^2 / ( V s ) ) < PSiFDCTBT : PC61BM ( 5.4 × 10^-5 cm^2 / ( V s ) ) , which may indicate that the side chains on PSiFDCTBT are spaced in such a way as to provide improved intercalation of PC61BM compared to the side chains of PSiFDCTPD and PSiFDCTDPP. 14,15 Looking at the absorption spectra in Figure 4 , PSiFDCTBT does indeed show the greatest red - shift when blended with PC61BM indicating that it undergoes the greatest degree of planarization upon blending in this particular series of polymers. The J-V and external quantum efficiency characteristics of the devices are shown in Figure 5. High V oc values were obtained from all devices. As the V oc can be linearly correlated with the difference between the HOMO level of electron donor ( polymers ) and the LUMO of electron acceptor ( PC61BM ) , 16 the V oc values matched the expected values calculated from the energy levels of polymer materials. In order to investigate the lower PCE of PL spectra of all three polymers with and without PC61BM were taken ( Figures S2-S4 , Supporting Information ). Both PSiFDCTPD : PC61BM and PSiFDCTBT : PC61BM blends exhibited over 90% PL quenching , whereas only 20% PL quenching was observed in blends consisting of PSiFDCTDPP : PC61BM showing that less charge transfer is occurring in the latter devices. This is the primary justification for that devices fabricated using PSiFDCTDPP : PC61BM showing a much lower J sc ( 3.8 mA / cm^2 ) and PCE ( 1.5% ) than devices fabricated from the other polymer : PC61BM blends. The highest performing devices were found from solar cells fabricated from PSiFDCTBT : PC61BM blends , with a PCE of 4.2% ( V oc = 0.86 V , J sc = 8.8 mA / cm^2 , FF = 56% ). Devices fabricated from PSiFDCTPD : PC61BM under the same processing conditions only showed a PCE of 2.7% . From the E Q E s p e c t r a i t c a n b e s e e n t h a t a l t h o u g h PSiFDCTPD : PC61BM achieved the highest maximum value of approximately 65% , PSiFDCTBT : PC61BM showed a broader profile and higher average EQE values. At short wavelengths , the EQEs of PSiFDCTBT : PC61BM blends were about 2 to 3 times higher than the other two active layer blends.",

    "sentence": "Two broad bandgap polymers , poly{(indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene)-alt-[2,5-bis(thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo [5,4-d] PIDTT-TzTz-TT , were designed and synthesized by copolymerizing the ladder - type indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( IDTT ) donor with a thiazolothiazole ( TzTz ) acceptor. Both polymers possess moderate hole - mobilities of around x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) using PIDTT-TzTz-PC71BM as the active layer showed good power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs as high as 5.53% and 5.90% ) in both conventional and inverted devices , without using any solvent additives. These results demonstrate that these broad bandgap PIDTT - TzTz polymers have potential to be used as a front cell for polymer tandem cells . Tremendous progress has been made in recent years on the development of organic photovoltaic materials , especially donor - acceptor ( D-A ) polymers , which have achieved an impressive photovoltaic performance of over 9% efficiency , when blended with fullerene derivatives. 1,2 Among semiconducting polymers , broad bandgap ( BBG ) materials have attracted a lot of attention because of their potential applications in tandem solar cells [3][4][5] and semi-transparent materials. [6][7][8][9] To date , regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) is one of the most representative BBG polymers. High photovoltaic performances of P3HT have been accomplished by utilizing indene-C 60 ( or C 70 ) bis-adducts as the electron acceptor in bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) devices. [10][11][12] However , the long - term oxidative stability of P3HT is an issue due to its high - lying HOMO level , as well as lm uniformity and reproducibility when it is used in large scale roll - to - roll printing because of P3HT 's sensitivity to the processing conditions. To solve these issues , other alternative materials have been developed. The approach of using a D-A polymer is an attractive way to develop conjugated polymers due to easy tuning of their bandgaps and energy levels. From a molecular design viewpoint , weak donors are usually adopted in the polymer structure to ensure a low - lying HOMO level , which is closely correlated with the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of polymer photovoltaic devices. 13 Many different kinds of donor structures have been utilized in BBG polymers , such as uorene , carbazole , benzodithiophene ( BDT ) , and indacenodithiophene ( IDT ). [14][15][16][17][18][19] Meanwhile , the incorporated acceptor moieties have included 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) , 4,4 0 -dihexyl-2,2 0 -bithiazole ( BTz ) , or 2,5-bis(thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo [5,4-d]thiazole ( TzTz ). 20,21 High power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) have been obtained through subtle choices of donor and acceptor segments and tuning the side - chain structures. 20,22 For example , PCDTBT , with a bandgap of 1.88 eV , prepared by copolymerizing 2,7-carbazole and DTBT , showed a high PCE above 6% . 14,15 Janssen and co-workers further incorporated this BBG polymer into tandem solar cells , which resulted in a higher PCE of greater than 7% for their best devices.",

    "sentence": "3 Nevertheless , compared to well - developed low bandgap polymers , BBG polymers remain less explored , especially while considering other aspects in addition to photovoltaic performance , such as longterm stability and ease of processing. It is highly desirable to design and synthesize new BBG materials to full these requirements. Ladder - type donors have been widely utilized in D-A polymers. [23][24][25][26][27][28][29] These large fused - ring moieties usually result in polymers with high charge carrier mobilities due to reduced reorganizational energies and good solubility in common organic solvents. Amorphous materials are usually obtained based on ladder - type donors possessing cyclopentadiene rings because the out - of - plane side - chains prevent ordered packing of polymer backbones. Therefore , the morphologies of the asprepared lms of polymers or fullerene blends are not sensitive to processing conditions according to our previous studies , 30,31 an important requirement for the commercialization of polymer solar cells. Moreover , impressive stability can be achieved based on ladder - type systems according to Cheng 's work. 32 The stable morphology of polymer lms contributed greatly to the overall stability of the device. Indacenodithieno [3,2-b]thiophene ( IDTT ) is a relatively new ladder - type donor , which features improved mobility and absorption coefficients of its polymers when compared to IDTbased polymers. 31 We believed that this donor would be an ideal segment for BBG polymers because it will not only enhance the mobility of the resulting polymers but also its weak donating strength should result in a deep - lying HOMO level , which is good for oxidative stability and critical to obtain a high V oc in photovoltaic devices. In this communication , two copolymers based on the IDTT donor were synthesized and investigated , namely PIDTT - TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT ( Scheme 1 ). TzTz was chosen as the acceptor moiety because of its rigid coplanar structure , which will not only facilitate p-electron delocalization but also enhance p-p stacking of the polymer backbone. TzTz - based polymers have also exhibited high mobilities in eld - effect transistors ( FET ) 33 and good photovoltaic performances. 16,19 In these two polymers , thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( TT ) were used as p-bridges , which was expected to increase the effective conjugation length and enhance intermolecular charge hopping between polymers. 34,35 However , PIDTT-TzTz-TT - based devices only showed a moderate PCE ( 4.4% ) , probably due to their poor solubility leading to un-optimized phase separation with PC71BM. Encouragingly , PIDTT - TzTz derived devices showed high PCEs of 5.53% and 5.90% , respectively in regular and inverted solar cell architectures , which makes it one of the best performing BBG polymers for PSCs. PIDTT - TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT were synthesized via the Stille cross-coupling polymerization reaction with palladium catalyst , the details of which can be found in the ESI. † PIDTT - TzTz has moderate solubility in hot chlorobenzene ( CB ) and dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) while PIDTT-TzTz-TT is only soluble in hot DCB.",

    "sentence": "The number - average molecular weights of PIDTT - TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT were 26 kDa and 34 kDa , respectively , with polydispersity indices ( PDI ) of 4.18 and 3.91. Differential scanning calorimetry of the polymers showed no apparent thermal transitions for either of the polymers between 20 °C and 280 C. The UV - vis absorption spectra of the two polymers in DCB solutions and in lms are shown in Fig. 1. For PIDTT - TzTz , an absorption peak at 569 nm was observed in the DCB solution while its maximum peak in the lm was blue - shied to 531 nm , probably due to twisting of the polymer backbone when the polymer chains were forced to pack together. Notably , PIDTT-TzTz-TT showed the same absorption maxima in both solution and lm states , which can be ascribed to the increased rigidity and coplanarity of its backbone compared to PIDTT - TzTz. 36 Both polymers possess a broad optical bandgap ( E g ) of 2.0 eV according to the onsets of lm spectra at around 620 nm. The energy levels of both polymers were estimated by cyclic voltammetry measurements. The corresponding redox curves are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI. † The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PIDTT - TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT are ( -5.24 , -3.21 ) and ( -5.34 , -3.03 ) eV , respectively. Owing to the incorporated IDTT donor moiety , both polymers possess reasonably low - lying HOMO levels , which is promising for achieving high V oc in their photovoltaic devices. 31 The even lower - lying HOMO level of PIDTT-TzTz-TT compared to that of PIDTT - TzTz is probably due to the higher aromaticity of the TT p - bridge unit relative to the thiophene unit. 37,38 The high - lying LUMO levels of both polymers guarantee sufficient energy offsets to drive charge separation at the interface between the polymer and PC71BM in photovoltaic devices. Charge mobilities of pristine polymers in FET devices were investigated with a bottom gate / top contact conguration. The corresponding transfer curves are shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI † and relevant parameters are summarized in Table 1. PIDTT-TzTz-TT showed a saturated hole mobility of 7.0 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , slightly higher than that of PIDTT - TzTz ( 1.5 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). This result suggests that the extended TT bridge in PIDTT-TzTz-TT indeed improves hole transportation , due to the increased coplanarity of the polymer backbone and enhanced intermolecular charge hopping compared to PIDTT - TzTz. 34 Photovoltaic properties of both polymers were investigated initially with a BHJ device conguration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / bis-C 60 / Ag under the illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mA cm^-2 ( Fig. S3 of the ESI † ).

Although PIDTT-TzTz-TT has a higher hole mobility than PIDTT - TzTz , the lower J sc and FF of PIDTT-TzTz-TT - based devices can be attributed to their inferior solubility , which reduces the polymer composition in the BHJ layer and leads to an un-optimized morphology. Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) images were acquired to investigate the difference of morphologies of BHJ layers ( Fig. S4 † ). A relatively smoother thin lm morphology was observed for the PIDTT - TzTz - based BHJ layer , coinciding with the better phase separation in this active layer , resulting in higher performance of devices. Since inverted polymer solar cells have the advantages of high air stability , preferred vertical composition gradient and compatibility with roll - to - roll printing techniques , they have been widely explored using various materials , including BBG polymers. [43][44][45] Therefore , PIDTT - TzTz was further explored using an inverted architecture ( Fig. S5 of the ESI † ). As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 2 , the inverted conguration led to a superior device performance compared to the conventional device architecture , possessing a V oc of 0.90 V , a J sc of 10.99 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 0.59 , giving a PCE of 5.90% . The external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) of polymer-PC71BM devices with both regular and inverted architectures were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. All the J sc values calculated from the EQE curves under the standard AM 1.5G conditions match well with those obtained from the J-V measurements. Notably , the PIDTT - TzTz device has a high EQE of 70% around 550 nm , which ensures the efficient lightabsorbing ability of this BBG polymer. In conclusion , two BBG polymers PIDTT - TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT have been designed and synthesized based on the ladder - type donor , IDTT. Both polymers possess moderate holemobilities of around x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . High photovoltaic performance with PCEs of 5.53% and 5.90% could be obtained for PIDTT - TzTz in conventional and inverted device architectures , respectively , without the use of any solvent additives.

The bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) photovoltaic cells composed of an electron - donating conjugated polymer and an electronaccepting fullerene derivative in an active layer have been studiously researched as renewable energy source during the past decade. The various electron - donating polymers had been strategically designed and developed to achieve high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ). They must possess several properties simultaneously such as good solubility , high mobility of charge carriers , appropriate energy levels of highest occupied molecular orbital ( E HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( E LUMO ) because these properties have relation with characteristic parameters of BHJ solar cells such as short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and fill factor ( FF ). 1-7 Among these parameters , J sc is mainly determined by the amount of absorbed light in an active layer of BHJ solar cell. Therefore , it has been recognized that development of narrow band gap polymers is one of the most effective way to increase PCE because they can capture solar photons extending to near - infrared. 8 Recently , donor - acceptor ( D-A ) approaches by incorporating an alternating electron donating ( D ) unit and an electron accepting ( A ) unit in the polymer backbone have been examined to narrow the band gap ( E g ) of the polymers. 9 Above all , benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) has attracted much attention as a D-building block of D-A type polymers.",

    "sentence": "To date , several alkoxy or alkyl substituted BDT based polymers have been synthesized , and their BHJ photovoltaic properties have been reported. 10-24 One of the great advantage of BDT polymers is showing good hole mobility due to efficient πstacking of the planar units. 14 In addition , weak donor property of the BDT unit could keep the low E HOMO of the polymers. 15 Generally , low E HOMO of an electron - donating polymer leads to high V oc . 3,6,7 Polymers composed of the D - type dialkoxy substituted BDT unit and the A-type thieno [3,4-b]thiophene carboxylate unit ( PTB series ) are one of the most successful examples of BDT based D-A type polymers that exhibit high PCE. 7,11,25-27 In the PTB series , PTB7 shown in Figure 1 has a band gap of about 1.7 eV and presented a high PCE over 7% . 11,28 Furthermore , it has been reported that BHJ solar cells made from PTB7 have exceeded PCE of 9% by insertion of an interlayer polymer material at the cathode. 29 There might be still room for improvement on the PCE by narrowing E g of a series of the polymers toward 1.5 eV. 3,6,15,30 In relation to this , Citterio et al. reported the synthesis of dicarboxylatesubstituted 4,8-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDTC ) , where two alkyl ester side chains , instead of the alkyl or alkoxy side chains , bear at the BDT unit. 31 Preliminary examinations of BDTC by the density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation show rather lower E HOMO and E LUMO than those of the traditional BDT derivatives ( Figure 2 ). From this result , we considered the BDTC unit could serve as an electron - accepting unit in D-A polymers. Thus , in this paper , we design a narrow band gap D-A copolymer , poly [ 4,8-benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophenedicarboxylate-alt-thieno (3,4-b)thiophene ] ( PBDTC-TT , Figure 1 ) by combining BDTC and thieno [3,4b]thiophene ( TT ) units as A-and D-units , respectively. The fundamental characteristics of PBDTC-TT and photovoltaic properties are investigated . Synthesis and Properties of PBDTC - TT. The synthetic pathway for the polymers is shown in Scheme 1. Number - average molecular weight ( M n ) and polydispersity ( M w / M n ) of PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 were 10.1 kg / mol , 12.5 kg / mol , 1.18 , and 1.48 , respectively. The molecular weights of the polymers were comparable each other and not so high but enough to investigate their basic properties and to examine basic characteristics of BHJ solar cell devices. 33,34 Thermogravimetric analysis of PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 showed that temperatures of 5 wt % loss of them were 362 and 359 °C , respectively ( Figure 1S in the Supporting Information ) and were higher than those of a series of PTB based polymers ( about 320 °C ).",

    "sentence": "35,36 This result suggests that PBDTC-TT has good thermal stability as well as the PTB polymers Figure 3 shows the absorption spectra of PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 with a reference data of PTB7 , and the results are summarized in Table 1. The optical characteristics of PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 were basically same. Interestingly , the wavelengths of absorption maximum ( λ max ) and absorption onset ( λ onset ) of PBDTC - TT1 in CHCl 3 were observed at 702 and 827 nm , respectively , which were significantly red - shifted compared with those of PTB7 ( Figure 3a ). It is considered that intramolecular charge transfer effectively occurs between the Dtype TT unit and A-type BDTC unit in PBDTC - TT. Thin films of PBDTC-TT showed two λ max at 707 and 757 nm , a broad absorption band from 500 to 900 nm , and λ onset almost the same as those in solution. The absorption spectrum extending to the near - infrared region is overlapped with solar photon flux around 700 nm , 4,37 which might enhance exciton generation. The E g of PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 determined from λ onset were 1.50 and 1.53 eV , respectively. These values are almost the same as an ideal E g of 1.5 eV for electron - donating materials to be performed BHJ solar cells efficiently. 3,6,15 Energy Levels of the Polymers. The E HOMO values of PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 were estimated from their onset of photoelectron spectra in the atmosphere ( Figure 2S in the Supporting Information ) , and the results are summarized in Table 1. PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 showed E HOMO of -4.83 and -4.80 eV , respectively , which were lower than that of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) ( E HOMO = -4.70 eV , E g = 1.90 eV ) and higher than that of PTB7 ( E HOMO = -5.15 eV , E g = 1.69 eV ). The V oc is directly related to difference between the E HOMO of a donor and the E LUMO of an acceptor such as PCBM , i.e. , basically lower E HOMO of the donor can contribute to obtain higher V oc . The E LUMO of the PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 estimated from their E HOMO and E g were situated at about -3.33 and -3.27 eV , respectively. It is generally recognized that E LUMO of the photoactive donor material should be at least 0.3 eV higher than E LUMO of PCBM ( -4.3 eV ) for efficient charge separation of generated excitons. 3,6,38 Accordingly , it is assumed that the E LUMO of the polymers are sufficiently high for the charge separation. X-ray Diffraction Analysis. The X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) analyses were performed to investigate structural order of the polymers in the film state.",

The former diffractions correspond to interchain distances between conjugated polymer backbones while the latter is attributed to π-stacking distance between planar polymer backbones as summarized in Figure 5. PBDTC - TT1 that has a hexyl chain at TT showed that the interchain distance observed by XRD is almost equivalent to length of the dodecyl ester chain at BDT estimated by the DFT calculation , whereas PBDTC - TT2 that has a dodecyl chain at TT showed the rather longer interchain distance in the XRD result. These results suggest that a hexyl chain at TT in PBDTC - TT1 is put in the interdigitated polymer main - chain packing separated by the dodecyl ester spacer but the dodecyl chain at TT in PBDTC - TT2 disturbs to form the dense packing , broadening the space adequately. Polymer Solar Cell. BHJ solar cells were fabricated by spin coating of o-dichlorobenzene solutions of PBDTC-TT The optimized BHJ OPV consisting of PBDTC - TT2 and PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 ) showed a PCE of 1.71% with J sc of 7.13 mA cm^-2 , FF of 0.47 , and V oc of 0.51 V as shown in Table 2 , which was lower than that of the optimized BHJ OPV with PBDTC - TT1 and PC 70 BM. The different length of the side chain at TT between PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 might affect miscibility of the components and the domain size of the BHJ layer. However , the surface image of the blend film of PBDTC - TT2 : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 ) observed by AFM was the aggregate of spherical domains similar to that of PBDTC - TT1 : PC 70 BM ( 2 : 3 ) ( Figure 3S in the Supporting Information ). The lower PCE of PBDTC - TT2 : PC 70 BM than PBDTC - TT1 : PC 70 BM is mainly attributed to the lower J sc . To investigate the difference of J sc s in the two BHJ OPVs , the hole mobility of the polymers was measured by the method of organic field effect transistors ( OFETs ). PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 showed hole mobilities of 6.9 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and 3.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively ( Figure 4S in the Supporting Information ). So , the lower J sc of the BHJ devices of PBDTC - TT2 could be due to the lower hole mobility compared to PBDTC - TT1. The extended interchain spacing of PBDTC - TT2 shown in Figure 5 could lead to the lower hole mobility.",

The difference of IPCE between both BHJ devices is responsible for the difference of their J sc . It is thought that narrowing of the interchain spacing of PBDTC-TT should be an effective factor to increase J sc as well as PCE from considerations of the results of XRD and OFET as mentioned above . In summary , thieno [3,4-b]thiophene ( TT ) and benzodithiophene dicarboxylate (BDTC)-based new donor - acceptor conjugated polymers were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization. They possess the narrow band gap of ∼ 1.5 eV , small π-stacking distance , high lying E HOMO and good solubility to common organic solvents. The BHJ solar cells using PBDTC - TT1 exhibited the PCE value of 3.03% with J sc of 12.54 mA cm^-2 , FF of 0.48 , and V oc of 0.51 V , while that using PBDTC - TT2 showed PCE of 1.71% with J sc of 7.13 mA cm^-2 , FF of 0.47 , and V oc of 0.51 V. The higher performance of PBDTC - TT1 : PC 70 BM ( 2 : 3 ) than PBDTC - TT2 : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 ) was almost ascribed to the higher J sc of the former device. According to XRD analysis and OFET measurements , the denser packing structure of PBDTC - TT1 results in the higher hole mobility , which leads to the higher PCE value in comparison with the device using PBDTC - TT2. BHJ OPVs based on PBDTC - TT1 and PBDTC - TT2 achieved efficient sensitization of the whole visible range and the near-IR region as far as 900 nm. These results show that the BDTC unit can behave as an electron - accepting unit of D-A type conjugated polymers , and also demonstrates that the series of PBDTC-TT is a candidate of new D-A type narrow band gap polymers for BHJ solar cells .",

The power conversion efficiency of the device was enhanced from 3.9 to 4.4% in the presence of the 0-5 % PTPA-P3HT-PTPA under illumination of AM 1.5G ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). The morphology variation and the balance of the hole / electron mobility accounted for such enhancement. In the P3HT / PCBM / PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ternary blends , the fiber - like structure was observed for surfactant ratios of 0-5 % , while a sphere - like nanostructure was observed for the surfactant ratio of 1.5% . The sphere - like nanostructure led to a smaller domain size and enhanced interfacial area for charge separation as compared to the fiber - like structure. On the other hand , the increased hole mobility in the blend with the addition of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA resulted in the balanced hole and electron mobility ( μ e / μ h ∼ 1.7 in comparison to the ratio of 3.6 without the surfactant ). The incorporated PTPA-P3HT-PTPA surfactant not only extended the lifetime of solar cells but also reduced the PCBM aggregation upon annealing , resulting in better thermal stability. The DSC result confirmed the selective miscibility of the PTPA coil segment with PCBM. These results demonstrated the superior compatibilizing effect of the rod - coil triblock copolymers for solar cell applications . Polymer bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells with a photoactive layer consisting of an interpenetrating network of π-conjugated polymer donors and soluble fullerene or nanocrystal acceptors , have attracted much interest because of their easy processability , low material cost , high efficiency , and mechanical flexibility. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] The most used system up to now is a blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( rr-P3HT ) and [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) , in which well - acknowledged state - of - the - art P3HT / PCBM BHJ solar cells give efficiencies in the range of 3-5 % . 2,6,7 In such blend materials , the typical exciton diffusion length of conjugated polymers is about 10 nm , therefore the donor and acceptor materials should ideally form 10 nm - scale interpenetrating networks within the active layer to ensure an efficient dissociation of excitons. 15,16 Control of the morphology within the BHJ active layer , including different solvents ( or mixed solvents ) , 17 solvent annealing , 2,6 processing additives , 3,[18][19][20][21][22] and thermal treatment , 7,23 could significantly facilitate nanoscale phase separation and further enhance the device performance. For a P3HT / PCBM blend , the crystallized P3HT fibril structure and enhanced charge transport was found via a thermal annealing process ; however , the phase segregation of the active layer changes dramatically upon heating owing to the aggregation and diffusion of PCBM clusters. 7,23 The phase separation decreases the interfacial area and causes insufficient exciton dissociation between P3HT and PCBM.",

[18][19][20][21][22] Fr echet et al. first employed a donor - acceptor diblock copolymer as a surfactant not only to tune the device morphology but also to stabilize the device structure against destructive thermal phase segregation. 18 In addition , the harmonizing effect of the diblock copolymer on a P3HT / perylene bisimide - based device has been explored for controlling the phase separation within the active layer. 19 Wudl and co-workers reported that the addition of 5 wt % P3HT - based copolymers resulted in an improved performance ( PCE = 3.5% ) , higher than that obtained from a pristine P3HT / PCBM device ( PCE = 2.6% ). 21 However , the synthetic methods for such block copolymers include complicated multistep reactions. In addition , there has never been a report on a photovoltaic application achieving more than 4% based on a surfactant approach employing block copolymers. Our group has developed a facile synthetic methodology for coil-rod-coil triblock copolymers with low polydispersities ( PDI < 1.2 ) by a combination of quasi-living Grignard metathesis and living anionic polymerizations , 31,32 as shown in Scheme 1. Our goal in this study is to incorporate different ratios of poly-(4-vinyltriphenylamine)-b-poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(4-vinyltriphenylamine) ( PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ) into P3HT / PCBM - based devices serving as a surfactant. The motivations for the selection of PTPA are as follows. ( 1 ) PTPA-P3HT-PTPA itself showed a clear microphase separation with a neat and periodic lamellar morphology of 10-12 nm in width , comparable to an exciton diffusion length. 32 ( 2 ) PTPA is an amorphous coil - like polymer , so PCBM may be selectively miscible with the PTPA domain rather than the crystalline P3HT domain. ( 3 ) The hole - transporting property of PTPA does not interfere significantly with the hole mobility of P3HT compared to completely insulating coil polymers like PS and PMMA segments. The effects of different block copolymer ratios on optical properties , morphology , thermal properties , and field effect transistor ( FET ) characteristics were studied and correlated to the solar cell performance. The experimental results suggested that the improved PCE of a P3HT / PCBM solar cell device achieving 4.4% and enhanced long - term stability upon heating could be attributed to the change of morphology and superior compatibilizing effect with the introduction of triblock copolymer , PTPA-P3HT-PTPA .

With the addition of the triblock copolymer , the blended films exhibit similar absorption spectra when compared to pristine P3HT / PCBM film. In general , the three distinct absorption peaks could be attributed to the π-π* transition ( 511 nm ) and π-π stacking ( 555 and 605 nm ) of P3HT. 33 Comparable absorption intensities of blend films containing 0% , 0.25% , and 1.5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , obtained at around 1.00 x 10^5 to 1.05 x 10^5 cm^-1 ( at an absorption maximum of 605 nm ) , indicate that small amounts of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , incorporated into the P3HT / PCBM system , do not affect significantly the crystallinity of P3HT. However , with the addition of 5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , the absorption coefficient apparently decreases , which not only decreases the absorptivity but also affects the packing of P3HT. 2a and summarized in Table 1. The PCE ( % ) of the corresponding polymer of various ratios of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA in P3HT / PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) system are 3.9 ( 0% ) , 3.9 ( 0.25% ) , 4.0 ( 0.5% ) , 4.2 ( 1% ) , 4.4 ( 1.5% ) , 4.2 ( 2.5% ) , 4.2 ( 5% ) , 3.6 ( 10% ) , and 3.0 ( 20% ) , respectively , as depicted in Figure 2 ( b ). Obviously , the enhanced PCE as compared to the pristine P3HT / PCBM system could be related to the addition of the surfactant. As listed in Table 1 , where the V oc values of the photovoltaic devices are maintained in the range of 0.61 - 0.63 V indicates that the small amounts of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA do not affect the HOMO level of the P3HT - based donor system. With similar absorption ability and molecular energy levels of the P3HT / PCBM / PTPA-P3HT-PTPA system described above , we could attribute the enhanced PCE to the charge transport mobility and morphology , as analyzing the following sections. Field Effect Transistors ( FETs ) Characteristics. Since the charge transport in polymer blends is crucial for solar cells , the FET is a powerful tool to investigate the hole and electron mobilities of polymer blends. 34 All FET devices were fabricated by employing top - contact configuration for reducing contact resistance. In order to understand the balance between hole and electron mobilities within polymer blends and its effect on solar cell performance , we used a bare Si / SiO 2 wafer without any surface treatment for preventing the vertical segregation of PCBM. 35 The transfer characteristics of the studied blended materials based FET devices are shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information.",

The μ h of the P3HT / PCBM system with various amounts of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA are 7.17 x 10^-4 ( 0% ) , 7.41 x 10^-4 ( 0.25% ) , 8.89 x 10^-4 ( 1.5% ) , and 1.50 x 10^-3 ( 5% ) cm2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , while their corresponding μ e are 2.58 x 10^-3 , 1.81 x 10^-3 , 1.52 x 10^-3 , and 1.95 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. The highest μ e / μ h ratio ( 3.6 ) of pristine P3HT / PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) is similar to a previous work with a space - charge - limited current ( SCLC ) model. 36 The higher electron mobility compared to the hole mobility is due to the intrinsic electrontransport and easily percolated network characteristics of PCBM. In our case , the hole mobility increases gradually which may be due to the donor characteristic of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , 32 further reducing the μ e / μ h ratio with the addition of the surfactant. Note that the low μ e / μ h ratio of 1.5% ( 1.7 ) and 5% ( 1.3 ) PTPA-P3HT-PTPA blended system could be achieved , and a balanced mobility is crucial for high - performance solar cell applications. Atom Force Microscopy ( AFM ) measurement was explored to further investigate the molecular organization and film morphology of the blended system. Figure 4 and Figure S3 ( in Supporting Information ) show the AFM images of the P3HT / PCBM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) system with different ratios of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA. The fiber - like structure could be observed with the addition ratios ranging from 0% to 1% . Interestingly , a sphere - like structure was found by adding 1.5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , as shown in Figure 4b. By further increasing the addition ratios from 2% to 5% , the morphology changes from sphere to fiber , which suggests that the formation of a smaller domain size of sphere - like conformations could enhance the interfacial area in comparison to the fibrous structure. Furthermore , with the balanced mobilities of charge transport ( μ e / μ h ∼ 1.7 ) , the highest J sc ( 11.2 mAcm-2 ) of the 1.5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA blended system could be reached in accordance with the above two factors.",

    "sentence": "Even more balanced mobilities ( μ e / μ h ∼ 1.3 ) were obtained using 5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA compared to 1.5% , however the absorption ability was reduced seriously as the higher insulating segments were introduced. Hence , the best device performance was achieved with a V oc of 0.62 V , J sc of 11.2 mA / cm^2 , fill factor of 0.63 , and PCE of 4.4% when 1.5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA was used. A PCE of 4.4% has never been reached in a system employing block copolymers as surfactants. Longevity and Thermal Stability of Photovoltaic Cells. Apart from the efficiency improvement , air stability is another critical issue for photovoltaic cells. When oxygen and humidity are present , their diffusion into the cells is generally regarded as the dominant source of degradation. Protection of solar cells from air and humidity is necessary to extend their lifetime. To investigate the air stability for a device 's lifetime , prepared devices with encapsulation were stored under an atmosphere with relative humidity of ∼ 80% and temperature of ∼ 25 ° C. As shown in Figure 5 , the PCE decays 28% in the case of pristine P3HT / PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) device after 70 days. Surprisingly , the addition of a surfactant could reduce the degradation ratio to be around 12-22 % with various amounts of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ( 0.25% -5% ). The significantly enhanced environmental stability could be attributed to the increased tortuosity of the diffusion pathway 37 with the existence of a surfactant and to further reduction of the diffusion of oxygen and humidity into the internal part of the active layer. Thermal annealing is a process to obtain BHJ morphology and to increase the mobility of P3HT in a solar cell system , but an excess of exposure to high temperatures leads to largescale segregation of the two materials and devastation of the BHJ morphology. 7 The PCE of a pristine P3HT / PCBM device decays more than 40% upon 10 h of thermal treatment , compared to the normal conditions of 140 °C and 20 min as summarized in Table 2. The dramatic decrease of J sc could be attributed to the PCBM aggregation effect inducing large - scale phase separation , which further reduces the interfacial area. 23 Apparently , the decay ratio of PCE was successfully suppressed to around 10-25 % under long - term heating by the addition of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA. Furthermore , the optical microscopy images of the solar cells were explored to see the thermal effect on blended film as shown in Figure 6. For P3HT / PCBM blended with various amounts of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ( 0% , 5% , and 10% ) under 140 °C for 20 min , no obvious aggregates appeared in the optical microscopy images. With the long - term heating treatment , the needle - like aggregates of PCBM 150-350 μm in length dispersed densely in the pristine P3HT / PCBM system.",

    "sentence": "Similar observations are reported for PCBMneedles formed upon heating , attributed to a combination of local diffusion and crystallization of PCBM. 23 As for the 5% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA blend system , less dense PCBM aggregates and shorter needles ( 100-250 μm in length ) were observed. Furthermore , the PCBM aggregation effects were significantly quenched ( to 30-70 μm in length ) when 10% PTPA-P3HT-PTPA was added. This suggested that the presence of a PTPA-P3HT-PTPA surfactant could stabilize the active - layer morphology against destructive thermal phase segregation. DSC Study For Analyzing The Compatibilizing Effect. To further investigate the compatibilizing effect of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , the phase transition behavior of pristine materials ( P3HT , PCBM , and PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ) and blend systems ( P3HT / PCBM ( 3 mg / 3 mg ) and P3HT / PCBM / PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ( 3 mg / 3 mg / 6 mg ) ) , such as the glass transition temperature ( T g ) , melting temperature ( T m ) , and enthalpic changes upon melting , were estimated by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) under thermal pretreatment conditions ( 10 °C / min for both heating and cooling scans ) , as shown in Figure 7. The distinct melting peaks of PCBM and P3HT were 287.5 and 221.3 °C in lines c and d , respectively. Also , PTPA-P3HT-PTPA ( line e ) exhibited T g at 131.0 °C and T m at 198.5 °C , which correspond to the contribution of the PTPA and P3HT segments , respectively. For the P3HT / PCBM ( 3 mg / 3 mg ) binary blended system ( line b ) , the two melting peaks are assigned to the P3HT ( T m1 = 210.6 °C ) and PCBM ( T m2 = 284.3 °C ) melting characteristics in accordance with the corresponding pristine materials. With the addition of a surfactant to the ternary system ( P3HT / PCBM / PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , 3 mg / 3 mg / 6 mg ) , three distinct peaks ( T g = 128.1 °C , T m1 = 203.1 °C , and T m2 = 284.3 °C ) could be attributed to the PTPA segments of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , pristine P3HT combined with the P3HT segment of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , and pristine PCBM , respectively. The melting temperatures of the blend would decrease as compared to the individual components since the crystallinity and molecular arrangement were affected by each component. The broad endothermal melting peak of T m1 in the range of 158-240 ° C maybe due to the broad molecular weight distribution of pristine P3HT ( PDI ∼ 2 ) and the formation of different crystal sizes of P3HT segments in the blend system. The enthalpic change of the P3HT segments in the binary system is 4.36 J / g , similar to that of the ternary system ( 4.04 J / g ).",

These results indicate the selective miscibility of PTPA segments with PCBM , which suppress the large segregation of PCBM domains , maintaining the crystalline structure of P3HT domains. It is an important implication that largescale phase separation and PCBM segregation upon annealing could be suppressed in the P3HT / PCBM blend system with the introduction of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA . In summary , we have utilized a novel triblock copolymer , PTPA-P3HT-PTPA , comprised of poly(3-hexylthiophene) rod segment as a surfactant for P3HT / PCBM blend - based solar cells. With various amounts of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA added , the enhanced PCE could be related to the sphere - like nanostructure with enhanced interfacial area suitable for exciton dissociation and balanced mobility due to the donor characteristic of PTPA-P3HT-PTPA. The DSC measurement also help to explain the selective miscibility of PTPA coil segments with PCBM leading to the suppression of PCBM segregation upon annealing in accordance with optical microscopy study. The optimized PCE of the PTPA-P3HT-PTPA blended system reached up to 4.4% under illumination of AM 1.5G ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). This value is the highest among solar cell devices using block copolymers as surfactants. The increased PCE , combined with good air and thermal stability of solar cell devices by using a surfactant , indicates its promising potential for polymer solar cells .

    "sentence": "In a recent report ( Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2014 , 30 , 6583 ) we emphasized the importance of addressing research efforts in OPV - active materials toward synthetic processes scalable up to industrial production. In this context , palladiumcatalyzed direct (hetero)arylation polymerization ( DHAP ) can be a suitable approach to reduce the number of reaction steps and to avoid the use of toxic reagents in the synthesis of donor polymers. Random donor - acceptor copolymers have been shown to be promising materials for bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells with high efficiencies and increased thermal stability. We report here the synthesis by DHAP of a ternary double - acceptor / donor random copolymer including benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and benzo [d][1,2,3]triazole as the accepting units and benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene as the donor moiety. The results are discussed in comparison with the synthesis of the same polymer via the Stille polymerization. The coupling products formed in the early stage of the polycondensation have been isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy to gain insight into the regiochemistry of DHAP. The polymers synthesized have been tested in BHJ solar cells with PC71BM as the electron acceptor material. Power conversion efficiencies ( up to 2.8% ) are comparable or lower ( depending on the processing conditions ) than those of the same polymer synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction ; however , the DHAP protocol is more convenient in terms of synthetic complexity . Semiconducting polymers are widely used in organic photovoltaics ( OPVs ) as light absorbing / electron donor materials in bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells. 1,2 The interest in polymer solar cells stems from the low - cost solution processability of organic polymers by conventional printing techniques and from the possibility of obtaining lightweight , flexible , and colored modules. In the past few years , remarkable improvements in power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of labscale BHJ devices were achieved ( over 10% ) 3,4 using copolymers with alternating electron - donor and electronacceptor units ( D-A copolymers ) , thus confirming the great potential of this technology. The D-A structural motif gives the possibility to tailor the HOMO-LUMO gap energy of the donor polymers by proper choice of the monomers involved in the polymerization process. 5 However , scalability at industrial level of the synthesis of D- A polymers is still a major issue preventing large - scale use of plastic solar cells. 1,2 In fact , most of the best performing copolymers are prepared by the Stille cross-coupling reaction , which involves the use of organo-stannanes. Besides being highly toxic , the stannylated monomers are synthesized via multistep organometallic processes and require demanding purification steps. 6-9 In the recent literature , direct (hetero)arylation polymerization ( DHAP ) has been reported as a clean and cheap route to conjugated polymers compared to conventional organometallic cross-coupling reactions. 10-17 It involves a halogenated ( most commonly I , Br ) aromatic monomer and an aromatic substrate bearing a C-H bond activated via a Pd catalyst.",

The possibility of avoiding the use of organometallic reactants undoubtedly makes this approach particularly appealing for industrial scalability ; 1 however , the possible formation of structural defects in the polymer backbone ( i.e. , homocoupling , branching , and cross-linking processes ) 18 can negatively affect the electronic properties of the final materials and their performances in devices. In addition , the conditions of DHAP reactions need to be optimized for each different combination of reactants. The present contribution describes our investigations on the potentialities and features of DHAP as a synthetic route to random ternary copolymers. The random copolymer approach appears particularly promising 19 for the possibility of fine - tuning the optoelectronic properties and the solubility of the final materials by tailoring the chemical nature and the relative amount of the monomers involved in the polymerization. In addition , the random structure could positively affect the active layer stability , as observed in the case of low - regioregular poly(3hexylthiophene)s ( P3HTs ). 20 To the best of our knowledge , only one example of DHAP protocol applied to the synthesis of semirandom polymers involving three reacting units has been reported so far. 21 This study by Thompson et al. critically discussed the potentialities and drawbacks of DHAP of unsubstituted thiophene and 3hexyl-2-bromothiophene as donor comonomers and 4,7-bis bromobenzothiadiazole or dibromo-dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole as accepting comonomers. Although this polymerization is in fact a three - component reaction , the donor units of the polymer reported are all thiophene rings differing only for the alkyl substituents. Here , we report a study on DHAP of three different monomers , which affords a random ternary D-A copolymer P ( Figure 1 ) , with benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole and benzo[d]- [1,2,3]triazole as the accepting units and benzo [1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene as the donor moiety. The same random copolymer P obtained via Stille coupling reaction was already reported , 22 and we have carried out a comparative study on the properties of the materials obtained via the two different protocols , also covering the performances in solar cells. We have performed a detailed structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy of the main coupling products formed in the early stage of the direct arylation process to shed light on the regiochemical course of the reaction. Copolymer P , synthesized via Stille cross-coupling , exhibited power conversion efficiency of ∼ 3% that can be increased to 4% by treatment with chloronaphtalene , and it can be obtained by a process whose synthetic complexity ( SC ) , defined in a recent report 2 by Po et al. , is 45 on a scale 1-100.",

Synthesis of the Random Copolymer P. In principle , two polymerization routes ( a and b in Scheme 1 ) can be followed to obtain the ternary random copolymer P via DHAP. Route a , carried out under the best conditions reported for DHAP of monomer 1 [ Hermann - Beller catalyst ( 4% mol ) , pivalic acid ( 30% mol ) , P(o-MeOPh) 3 ( 8% mol ) , Cs 2 CO 3 ( 2 equiv ) in dry toluene for 36 h ] , 23 failed to afford polymer P. This result can be likely ascribed to the low acidity of the hydrogen atoms at the 4,7-positions of the electron - accepting units 2 and 3 , which do not easily undergo C-H bond activation step. Actually , it is well known that the heterolytic dissociation energy represents a critical factor influencing the regioselectivity of the direct arylation processes. 24 For this reason , the C-H bond ortho-functionalization with electronwithdrawing groups ( e.g. , fluorine atoms ) is a common structural modification to increase the acidity of the hydrogen atoms , thus enhancing the reactivity of the C-H bonds involved in the activation process. 25 Polymerization was thus performed via the route b by reacting benzodithiophene 4 with dibromobenzothiadiazole 5 and dibromobenzotriazole 6 in 2 : 1 : 1 ratio ( Scheme 2 ). The process was investigated under various experimental conditions summarized in Table 1. Different polar solvents were tested at 120 °C in the presence of Pd(OAc) 2 ( 10% mol ) as the precatalyst , pivalic acid ( PivOH ) as the carboxylate ligand and potassium carbonate as the base under phosphine - free conditions ( Table 1 , entries 1- 5 ). The reaction in N,N-dimethylacetamide ( DMAc ) afforded a polymer ( M w = 64 kDa , M n = 9 kDa ) in 50% yield. In Nmethylpyrrolidinone ( NMP ) , also with microwave assistance , the precipitation of a dark solid consisting of oligomeric products was observed during the polymerization. Only oligomers were also obtained in a mixture of NMP and toluene ( volumetric ratio 1 : 1 ) and in N-benzylpyrrolidinone ( NBP ) ( used to increase the solubility of the products ) ( entries 2 and 4 ) , respectively. Considering the positive outcomes of DHAP in DMAc , we further investigated the effects of other experimental conditions both on yields and molecular weights of the reaction carried out in this solvent. Polymers with higher molecular weight were obtained in the presence of Pd(OAc) 2^5 % mol ( entries 6 and 7 ). Lowering the catalyst amount to 1% mol ( entry 8 ) significantly reduced both the molecular weight and the yield of the final polymer.",

This is an interesting result for the simplicity of the synthetic protocol and can positively affect the performances of the final material in the device. In fact , it is well - known that inorganic impurities , if embedded in the polymer , can reduce the charge transport properties. 27-29 Lower molecular weight and yield ( Table 1 , entry 9 ) were obtained by adopting different experimental conditions ( Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 and P(o-OMePh) 3 as catalyst and supporting phosphine ligand respectively in dry THF ). 30 Spectroscopic and Optical Characterization. The hightemperature 1H NMR spectra of the polymer P DA 2 and the reference P STILLE in C 2 D 2 Cl 4 solution are compared in Figure 2. Comparison between the area values of the signal b at 4.98 ppm , related to the methine proton of the alkyl chain on the benzotriazole unit , and the broad signal a in the 4.50 - 3.93 ppm range , due to the OCH 2 protons of the alkyl chains on the benzodithiophene unit , enabled us to assess that in both the Stille and the DHAP reactions the two accepting units ( Scheme 2 ) were incorporated into the polymer backbone in equimolecular amounts , according to the initial feed composition. Comparison of the aromatic regions of the spectra 1 and 2 clearly shows that there are some structural differences between the two polymers. These differences also appear in the UV - vis absorption spectra of the polymers P DA 1-P DA 5 versus P STILLE . Thin - film absorption spectra of P DA 1-P DA 4 showed higher energy maxima with respect to the reference P STILLE ( Figure 3 and Table 1 ). This observation suggests that effective conjugation in P DA 1-P DA 4 may be affected by structural defects. Only the spectrum of P DA 5 , despite its lower molecular weight , closely resembles that of P STILLE . This may suggest a more regular structure of P DA 5 compared with P DA 1-P DA 4 ( although P DA 5 performances in photovoltaic devices were markedly poor ( see later ) ). In DHAP , branching or cross-linking processes can occur during the reaction because both α and β C-H bonds of benzodithiophene could , in principle , be activated ( Figure 4a ) , even if α-functionalization should be the most favorite process for stereoelectronic reasons.",

    "sentence": "24 On the contrary , in the Stille reaction ( Figure 1 , route c ) the use of organotin reagent 7 fixes the regiochemistry of the coupling to the α-position of the benzodithiophene unit , ensuring a linear structure of the final polymer. To gain insight into the regiochemical course of the DHAP in DMAc , we analyzed the reaction mixture during the first 2 h of the polycondensation process. The polymerization reaction Scheme 1. DHAP ( Routes a and b ) and Stille ( route c ) Protocols for the Synthesis of the Copolymer P Scheme 2. General Scheme of the DHAP ( entry 6 ) was quenched after 1 or 2 h , and the main products were isolated out of the reaction mixtures by chromatography. We obtained five solid samples F1-F5 ( Chart 1 ) with increasing molecular weights and different colors , from yellow to purple , which suggests the growth of the chain length and πconjugation as the reaction proceeds. After 2 h , it was not possible to isolate single products because of the increased complexity of the reaction mixture. Quenching the polymerization after 1 h , the homocoupling product of benzodithiophene F1 and the brominated coupling adduct of benzodithiophene and benzothiadiazole F2 were isolated ( Chart 1 ). After 2 h , the main reaction products were F3 , F4 , and F5. The structures of these intermediates were completely assessed by high - resolution mass spectrometry and 1 H and 13 °C NMR spectroscopy. The assignment of 1 H and 13 °C NMR spectra required the use of both 1D and 2D techniques. The regiochemistry of the substitution at the benzodithiophene unit was studied by 2D NOESY experiments. As concerns F1 , 1 H and 13 °C NMR spectra were in close agreement with data already reported in the literature 31 and will be not further discussed. The structures of compounds F2-F5 were elucidated considering some general features of their NMR spectra. First , if mass spectrum indicates the presence of bromine in the molecule ( also confirmed by a strongly shielded 1 ). signal at nearly 110-115 ppm in the 13 °C NMR spectra ) , there should be a benzothiadiazole or benzotriazole moiety as the end unit of the molecule. Both benzotriazole and benzothiadiazole are characterized by similar 1 H and 13 °C NMR aromatic resonances with chemical shift values strongly depending on substitution and degree of polymerization. Anyway , the inclusion of a benzotriazole unit in the oligomers is indicated by the typical 1 H and C resonances of the methine bonded to nitrogen ( a 1 H septet at ca. 4.9 ppm and a 13 °C resonance at ca. 70 ppm ). For the benzodithiophene unit , the terminal thienyl moieties give rise to two doublets in the aromatic region with a typical vicinal coupling constant of ∼ 5.5 Hz ( chemical shifts are strongly influenced by the chemical environment ) , whereas substituted thienyl moieties give a strongly deshielded resonance in the region 8.5 to 9 ppm.",

    "sentence": "On the basis of these general considerations , the determination of the structure of F2 was straightforward because HR-MS confirmed the presence of a bromine atom , and the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum suggested the presence of a monosubstituted benzoditiophene unit ( two doublets of an AX system at 7.41 and 7.48 ppm , respectively , with 3 J = 5.5 Hz , and a singlet at 8.78 ppm ) and a benzothiadiazole ( two doublets at 7.76 and 7.89 ppm , respectively , with 3 J = 7.8 Hz ). 1 H and 13 °C spectra of F3 and F5 indicated that ( i ) both molecules have symmetric structures , ( ii ) the inclusion of benzotriazole units can be excluded , and ( iii ) both compounds have two benzodithiophene end units. Moreover , the 1 H spectrum of F3 consisted of only two doublets at 7.38 and 7.47 ppm , arising from the two equivalent thienyl moieties at both ends of the molecule ; one singlet at 8.85 ppm , due to the thienyl units bonded to benzothiadiazole and a singlet at 7.94 ppm arising from the two chemically equivalent benzothiadiazole protons ( Figure 5 ). For F5 , apart from the two doublets of terminal thiophenes at 7.08 and 7.22 ppm ( 3 J = 5.3 Hz ) and an AB system centered at 7.45 ppm , which can be assigned to benzothiadiazole moieties , two singlets at 8.48 and 8.58 ppm suggested the existence of two chemically nonequivalent internal thienyl units. For F4 , ESI-MS indicated the presence of a bromine atom and hence a benzotriazole or benzothiadiazole end unit , whereas the 1H NMR spectrum put in evidence that the molecule is not symmetric and is constituted by a terminal thienyl group ( two doublets at 7.40 and 7.49 ppm with 3 J = 5.5 Hz ) , three nonequivalent internal thiophene rings , a benzotriazole , and a benzothiadiazole unit ( two doublets at 7.55 and 7.61 ppm with 3 J = 7.7 Hz and a more deshielded AB system centered at 8.00 ppm suggesting two protons with very similar shielding ). The exact position of the benzotriazole and benzothiadiazole units was determined with the aid of HMBC and NOESY experiments. 2D HSQC , HMBC , and NOESY experiments were necessary to assign 1 H and 13 °C NMR resonances ( Tables S2-S5 , Supporting Information ). The protonated carbons C-H were determined by HSQC experiments ; HMBC and NOESY spectra allowed constructing the fragments in each molecule and their sequences. Only the aromatic regions and the characteristic signals of OCH 2 protons of the benzodithiophene units were taken into account. The aliphatic regions of both 1 H and 13 °C spectra ( alkyl chains on benzodithiophene and benzotriazole ) are not of interest and were not considered. For all of the compounds examined , the assignment of 1 H and 13 °C NMR resonances ( see Supporting Information ) confirmed the structures in Chart 1.",

    "sentence": "To determine the regiochemistry of the cross-coupling reaction , 2D NOESY spectra of F3-F5 were acquired. Because of stereoelectronic factors , the α-arylation of the benzodithiophene ring by C-H activation should be the most favorite process , but the β-attack can not be excluded a priori. Considering the spatial arrangement of a benzodithiophenebenzothiadiazole ( or benzotriazole , Figure 4a ) fragment , if the thiophene ring is functionalized at the α-position , the βhydrogen atom is in the close proximity to the O-CH 2 - of one alkoxy chain on benzene ring. As a consequence , the through - space dipolar coupling between the thienyl proton and the methylene protons should give rise to a cross-correlation peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum. In the case of βfunctionalization , no Overhauser effect between OCH 2 and thienyl proton can be observed. In the 2D NOESY spectrum of F3 , a cross-peak between the methylene protons at 4.30 ppm and the internal thienyl proton at 8.85 ppm was well evident. Moreover , there was also a cross-peak between the other OCH 2 group at 4.23 ppm and the terminal thienyl proton at 7.47 ppm. Similar trends were also observed for the intermediates F4 and F5. In summary , these spectroscopic data indicate an initial regioregular evolution of the DHAP involving the α positions of the benzodithiophene units. Nevertheless , in advanced stages of the chains ' growth , the number of the free β positions becomes markedly higher than the number of the α positions at the ends of the chains , and the β / α ratio increases as the reaction proceeds ( Figure 6 ). For this reason , the formation of β defects in the polymer backbone may become statistically significant. This observation , together with the detected formation of homocoupling defects F1 , could rationalize the hypsochromic shift of the polymers synthesized by direct arylation in DMAc with respect to the reference P STILLE .

    "sentence": "22 A further improvement ( maximum PCE of 5% ) 22 was obtained through an ethanol surface treatment of the active layer that was carried out prior to evaporation of the aluminum cathode. As reported in Table 2 , the photovoltaic parameters of P STILLE are similar to P DA 1-P DA 3-based devices , without CN processing. When the active layer is deposited from CB , the J sc is 4.8 mA / cm^2 for P STILLE and ranges from 3.9 to 4.1 mA / cm^2 for the P DA 1-P DA 3-based devices ( Table 2 ). CN processing induces an almost 2-fold enhancement to 9.8 mA / cm^2 for P STILLE , while the J sc of P DA -s is not significantly improved by this treatment , with J sc values ranging from 4.9 to 5.6 mA / cm^2. The observed enhancement of J sc with CN processing is due to a reduction of phase segregation and a better degree of intermixing between the donor polymer and the acceptor fullerene that induces an enhancement of charge photogeneration. 22,32 Small improvements of the photovoltaic performances were also obtained with ethanol surface treatment. This treatment does not substantially affect the blend morphology ( see Supporting Information ) , but it likely reduces the barrier at the electrodes / active layer interface. 33 Upon CN processing and ethanol surface treatment the PCE for all polymers obtained by DHAP is lower than that of P STILLE ( Table 2 ). Interestingly , the PCE decreases with the polymer molecular weight. This decrease is consistent with previous studies reported in the literature , which suggested that , below M n ≈ 10^000 g / mol , the photovoltaic properties of polymerbased BHJ solar cells are affected by nonoptimal blend morphologies and poor optoelectronic properties. 34-36 It can be seen from Table 2 that , in devices obtained with CN processing and ethanol surface treatment , there is a substantial drop of J sc going from P STILLE to P DA 1-P DA 5 , which is quite significant in P DA 4 and P DA 5. The active layers were analyzed by optical microscopy to check whether such behavior is related to differences in the film - forming properties. Figure 7 shows the typical images obtained for the active layers. The aspect of P DA 1-P DA 3 films is similar to P STILLE active layer , while P DA 4 and P DA 5 active films exhibit a strong segregation on the microscopic scale. Furthermore , a strong scattering background is observed for P DA 5 blends ( Supporting Information ). These features can explain the lower photovoltaic performances of P DA 4 and the even poorer characteristics of P DA 5-based devices. Further support to this hypothesis derives from a deep AFM microscopy analysis of the P STILLE and P DA 1-P DA 3 blends. Figure 8 compares the AFM morphologies of P STILLE and P DA 2 through the CN processing.",

    "sentence": "It can be seen that an extended phase segregation , with similar large domains , is observed in the blends deposited from CB. This feature is consistent with the similar J sc parameters obtained prior to CN processing. It is also evident a significant reduction of phase segregation upon CN addition. P STILLE - based film exhibits a more intermixed morphology when compared with P DA 2. This is consistent with the more pronounced improvement of J sc observed in P STILLE than in P DA 1-P DA 3 devices upon processing . An example of three - component random polymerization via DHAP involving two different accepting units has been reported for the first time. The experimental results are discussed in comparison with the properties of the same copolymer obtained via the Stille reaction. The regiochemical course of the reaction in the early stage of the polymerization process has been investigated by NMR spectroscopy. Photovoltaic parameters for the synthesized polymers have been evaluated in comparison with P STILLE . P STILLE showed similar power conversion efficiencies to P DA in devices without processing with chloronaphtalene. CN processing strongly increases the performances of P STILLE , while P DA polymers are almost insensitive to this treatment. This trend can reasonably be ascribed to the lower molecular weights ( M n ) or structural defects of DHAP polymers. We consider DHAP to be a valid protocol for the synthesis of active materials , alternative to conventional cross-coupling reactions ( e.g. , Stille , Suzuki ) , also in view of a possible scalability at industrial level. In fact , an estimate of the reduced synthetic complexity parameter from 45 to 40 is calculated switching from Stille to DHAP reaction. Random polymer - izations via DHAP involving synthetically simple monomers could represent a promising approach , which undoubtedly deserves more investigation.",

    "sentence": "Here we design and synthesize one novel fluorene side - chained benzodithiophene ( BDT ) monomer for polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) donor.

PSCs are prepared with these polymers as donor and PC71BM as acceptor. The maximum power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the two polymers PFBDT - DTBT and PFBDT - DTff BT based PSCs is 7.13% ( V OC = 0.90 V , J SC = 13.26 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.598 ) and 7.33% ( V OC = 0.96 V , J SC = 13.24 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.577 ). The UV - vis absorption and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry test results show that F atoms in DTff BT unit present an obvious influence on intermolecular effect and molecular energy levels of polymers. Furthermore , the energy loss of two PSCs devices in this work is confirmed to be 0.78 and 0.71 eV , lower than most results based on BDT PSCs devices , which is critical to obtain high PCE PSCs devices with a decent trade - off between J SC and V OC . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have received significant attention due to the potential for the fabrication of light - weight , largearea , and flexible light harvesting devices through low - cost solution processing. 1-6 Among them , bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells based on the blend of donor and acceptor materials have been proved to be one of the most efficient structures , and the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) with fullerene acceptors has achieved over 10% in both single - and multijunction cells. 7-10 However , the classical fullerene acceptors ( for example , PC71BM : [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ) still have intrinsic drawbacks including the relatively narrow absorption region and low molar extinction coefficients , which would cause inefficient harvesting of solar energy. Therefore , the basic optoelectronic properties of donor materials are important and mostly determine photocurrent and photovoltaic efficiencies of polymer solar cells. D-A conjugated polymers including electron - rich and - deficient units along the polymer backbones have been intensively investigated for the convenience of tuning band gap and energy levels through the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) effect. 11,12 However , the design of efficient donor materials is still a challenging task because it should achieve a good balance among all the photovoltaic parameters including open circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short circuit current density ( J SC ) , and fill factor ( FF ) , which are directly proportional to power conversion efficiency ( PCE = J SC × V OC × FF / P in ) , where P in is the input light power.",

As we all know , the fluorene unit has usually been used as electron - donating moiety to design D-A conjugated polymers due to its rigidity , high hole mobility , and highly conjugated structures. 26,27 Andersson 's group introduced the fluorene unit to design donor materials of PSCs. 28 The resulting polymer PFDTBT exhibited good efficiency with PCE of 2.2% . Next , Andersson reported a series of D-A materials based on fluorene with different alkyl and alkoxy side chains with PCE up to 3.5% . 29 In order to improve the solubility and aggregation properties of polymers , Hou synthesized the D-A copolymer PFDTBT and BisDMO - PFDTBT with the PCE of 4.5% and 3.5% , respectively. 30 Woo also brought the fluorene unit into the backbone of highly crystallized polymers to disrupt partially the interchain organizations of excessive aggregation and improved the PCE from 2.6% to 6.6% . 31 Besides , the derivatives of fluorene ( including PFN and PFN-Br ) were wildly used as interface materials in PSCs field. 32-34 However , to the best of our knowledge , the fluorene unit is generally widely used as the electron - rich unit to construct the polymer backbone , and the photovoltaic polymers with fluorene unit as side chains have not been reported.

    "sentence": "PSCs devices based on PFBDT - DTBT show the best PCE up to 7.13% , with V OC = 0.90 V , J SC = 13.26 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.598. Meanwhile , devices based on PFBDT - DTff BT show largely enhanced V OC ( 0.96 V ) and the best PCE up to 7.33% without any additives or annealing process. Molecular conformations , photophysical / electrochemical properties , and film morphology of blend films were systematically investigated to reveal the structure - property relationships. This work suggests that fluorene moiety is a promising π-conjugated side chain group attached in BDT for the construction of efficient D-A conjugated photovoltaic polymers . Synthesis and Characterization. The structure and synthetic routes of D-A polymers are outlined in Scheme 1. The fluorene - substituted BDT monomer was designed as electron - donating moiety ( D ) , and DTBT and DTff BT are selected as two electron - withdrawing moieties ( A ). These two polymers PFBDT - DTBT and PFBDT - DTff BT were prepared by Stille polymerization in the presence of Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 stabilities of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min -1 . The TGA curves are shown in Figure S1 , and data were collected in Table S1. TGA plots reveal that polymers PFBDT - DTBT and PFBDT - DTff BT exhibit good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures ( T d ) 371 and 392 °C at 5% weight loss under nitrogen , respectively , which indicates that the thermal stability of the polymers is good enough for PSCs applications. The number - average molecular weight ( M n ) and polydispersity index ( PDI = M w / M n ) were measured by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) as the eluent and polystyrenes as the internal standards , and the data are collected in Table 1. As Table 1 indicates , polymer PFBDT - DTff BT shows higher M n and more favorable polydispersity index ( 1.09 ) , suggesting more orderly polymer backbones which should benefit the charge transport of PSCs devices. Photophysical Properties. The optical absorption spectra of polymers in dilute o-DCB solutions and thin films are shown in Figure 1a , and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1.The two polymers show similar spectra profiles with broad absorption from 350 to 730 nm covering most of visible spectrum , with two distinct absorption bands at 380-480 and 480-730 nm in solutions and films. The peaks at 380-480 nm are probably corresponding to the π-π* transition , and the major peaks at 480-730 nm should be attributed to the strong intermolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) effect between the donor and acceptor moieties. Moreover , the UV - vis spectra in thin films are red - shifted compared to those of solutions , which is attributed to the enhanced intermolecular interactions in the solid state.",

    "sentence": "Nevertheless , there are still some differences between polymer PFBDT - DTBT and PFBDT - DTff BT. The absorption spectra of PFBDT - DTff BT in solution and thin film exhibit obvious hypochromatic shift compared to those of PFBDT - DTBT. Analogous results were observed in other fluorine - substituted oligomers and polymers. 35 Different from PFBDT - DTBT , the absorption spectra of PFBDT- DTff BT exhibit strong shoulder peaks at 636 nm in solution ( 648 nm in film state ) which are directly correlated with polymer aggregation in solution and film state , indicating an improved intermolecular interaction from C-F dipole effect in the DTf f BT moiety. 22,36,37 The temperature - dependent absorption spectra arranging from 0 to 100 °C of PFBDT- DTf f BT in dilute solution were investigated to further understand the formation of polymer aggregates. As Figure 1b shows , when the solution is heated from 0 to 100 °C , the shapes of the aggregation peak at 648 nm decreased step by step during the heating process. More importantly , the shoulder peak can be detected even at 100 °C , which indicates that the aggregation of PFBDT - DTff BT was strong even at high temperature ( 100 °C ). Furthermore , the optical band gap ( E g opt ) of polymers PFBDT - DTBT and PFBDT - DTff BT are determined to be 1.71 and 1.79 eV from the onset of the absorption spectra in the thin film states according to E g opt = 1240 / λ onset . Electrochemical Properties. The oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) with the polymer coated on glassy carbon electrodes. 38 In order to obtain the oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymer , the reference electrode was calibrated using ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) , which had a redox potential with an absolute energy level of 0.40 eV in a vacuum. CV curves of polymers are shown in Figure 2a. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated from their onset oxidation potential ( φ ox ) and onset reduction potential 1. The deep HOMO energy level of PFBDT - DTff BT would help to obtain a high V OC in polymer solar cells. Moreover , as shown in Figure 2b , the gap of HOMO and LUMO levels ( ΔHOMO and ΔLUMO ) between polymers and PC71BM are both larger than 0.3 eV , which is essential to yield a sufficient driving force for exciton separation in BHJ solar cells.

To further understand the influence of fluorene unit in BDT and F atoms in DTff BT moiety on the polymer backbone conformations , quantumchemical calculations ( based on density functional theory , B3LYP / 6-31G ) were performed for the repeat unit of two polymers. The 2-ethylhexyl alkyl chains in BDT units were replaced by a methyl group to reduce the calculation time.",

    "sentence": "From Figure 3 we can see that the bulky fluorene units in BDT produce a large dihedral angle over 58 ° for two polymers. This highly twisting side groups are beneficial to improve the solubility of polymers and may induce decreased π-orbital overlap between side groups and polymer backbones. Nevertheless , it is clearly observed that both of two polymers exhibit favorable planarity along polymer backbone , which will benefit the charge transport in PSCs active layer. Moreover , the planarity of PFBDT - DTff BT is better than PFBDT - DTBT for the construction of weak noncovalent interactions between S and F atoms in the DTff BT moiety. As a result , polymer PFBDT - DTf f BT will possess enhanced intermolecular interactions , which would probably be one reason for the raised aggregation peaks in absorption spectra.

    "sentence": "Notably , two PSCs devices exhibit close short - circuit current densities and fill factors , while devices based on PFBDT - DTff BT exhibit significantly enhanced open - circuit voltage near 1.0 V. This should be attributed to its deep HOMO energy levels. To further optimize the solar cells performances , 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) additive and ITIC acceptor based devices were also systematically investigated. The detailed device performance is summarized in Tables S2 and S3 , and the J-V curves are shown in Figures S4 and S5. Unfortunately , they do not show positive improvement. The corresponding external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) of the PSCs were measured and are shown in Figure 4b. Two devices demonstrate broad photo response in 300-750 nm with the maximum value up to 80% at around 500 nm. Obviously , devices based on PFBDT - DTff BT reveal improved EQE response at 500-670 nm , owing to the strong aggregation peak in absorption spectra. Furthermore , the calculated J SC for PFBDT - DTBT and PFBDT - DTff BT based devices shows consistent well with the results from J- V measurement. Heterojunction Morphology Studies. Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( Figure 5 and Figure S6 ) were applied to investigate the morphology of blend films. From Figure 5 , we can see that both films of PFBDT - DTBT / PC71BM and PFBDT- DTf f BT / PC71BM display uniform and fine nanoscale structures. As shown in Figure 5 , the root-mean-square ( RMS ) roughness of PFBDT-DTBT:PC71BM and PFBDT- DTff BT : PC71BM are 0.35 and 0.98 nm , respectively. The difference of RMS is probably attributed to the stronger molecular interaction and aggregation ability. However , in the TEM of blend films ( Figure S6 ) , we do not observe this aggregation. We propose it may be related to the miscibility between donors and acceptors as well as the film forming mechanism of BHJ structure. Furthermore , some small holes can be observed in two blend films , which is preferable neither for efficient exciton dissociation nor for balanced charge transport. And the defects in blend films should be blamed partially for the low fill factors of two PSCs devices ( see Table 2 ). Energy Loss Analysis. The high V OC of PFBDT - DTff BT based device would afford a reduced energy loss ( E loss ) , which is defined as E loss = E g - eV OC , where E g is the lowest optical band gap between donor and acceptor materials. 39 In this work , E g is defined to be 1.67 eV from the onset absorption of PC71BM film at 743 nm ( see Figure S7 ). The E loss values of PFBDT- DTff BT based device are calculated to be 0.69 - 0.71 eV , smaller than most of the reported fullerene based PSCs and approaching the empirically low threshold of 0.6 eV ( see Tables 2 and 3 ).",

The three copolymers , namely PDBS - TQx , PDBS - TQxF and PDBS - TzQx , belong to the wide band - gap semiconductor materials family , and they show an absorption edge in the visible region close to 650 nm. In order to tune the position of the polymer energy levels , and in particular to decrease their HOMO energy level , we compare the use of a thiazole spacer sandwiching the electron - deficient moiety as an alternative way to the popular backbone fluorination.

They have attracted interest of many academic and industrial research teams 2 since it has been demonstrated that PSCs can be manufactured on lightweight , flexible and biodegradable substrates 3 and that they can be deposited on a large area using printing technologies , which reduces the cost and the energy payback time of the solar cells. 4,5 In the last decade , with the goal to improve the attractiveness of PSCs for future industrial production , many research studies have been focused on the development of more efficient devices by synthesizing new materials , 6,7 optimizing interface layers 8 and designing new device architectures. 9 While conventional bulk - heterojunction devices based on narrow band - gap ( NBG ) polymers in a single cell are now grazing the theoretical PCE limit with efficiencies around 11% , [10][11][12] new approaches based on the multiple absorbing species such as multiple - junction architectures and ternary blend based devices have showed highly promising performances 13,14 with PCE records of 11.83% and 10.50% respectively. 15,16 Tandem devices are fabricated by superposing vertically single bulk - heterojunction solar cells that are electronically connected by an appropriate recombination layer.

Ternary blend devices address a similar issue of a more efficient solar photon harvesting by using multiple absorbing species in a single active layer. Such a ternary solar cell can still benefit the easy fabrication process and has received renewed interest in the last few years. 17,18 For the fabrication of such panchromatic devices there exists a large variety of NBG materials that are capable of absorbing visible and near - infra red light. Most of these polymers show a PCE over 8% in single junction solar cells. [19][20][21] In contrast , the number of wide band - gap ( WBG ) materials capable of harvesting photons at shorter wavelengths and showing sufficiently high performances for use in tandem or multi-junction devices is limited to a few examples. [22][23][24][25] To date , the most used WBG material in panchromatic devices is still poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ). This polymer when blended with fullerene derivatives [6,6]-phenyl-C61butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or the indene - C60 bisadduct ( IC 60 BA ) can achieve a PCE of 5% 22 and 6.5% respectively in a single cell. 26 However P3HT has some limitations regarding the position of its highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level that impedes the achievement of a high open circuit voltage ( V OC ) in solar cells. Only a few WBG polymers can outperform P3HT in the shorter wavelength region ( 350 nm to 650 nm ). 27,28 To improve the currently reported record efficiencies of tandem and multi-junction cells it is now essential to develop new WBG materials as alternatives to P3HT showing better photovoltaic performances. Ideally these materials should combine a wider band - gap ( E opt > 1.9 eV ) , a good mobility of the charge carriers in order to maximize the short - circuit current - density J sc , and a lowlying HOMO energy level 29 that enables to achieve a larger open circuit voltage ( V OC ). In this contribution , we report on the synthesis and characterization of three wide band - gap copolymers ( 1.95 eV < E opt < 2.00 eV ) combining dibenzosilole and quinoxaline moieties. The quinoxaline and dibenzosilole units were linked together either with a thiophene or a thiazole spacer to give the copolymers named PDBS - TQx , PDBS - TQxF , and PDBS - TzQx. The copolymers have been fully characterized optically and electronically prior to their use in bulk - heterojunction solar cells with fullerene derivatives. PDBS - TQx and PDBS - TQxF , that contain thiophene spacers , show a relatively high hole mobility in the organic field effect transistor ( OFET ) configuration with values ranging from 2.5 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 up to 6.5 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 .",

    "sentence": "All the polymers revealed a quite narrow absorption in the visible range with an absorption edge close to 650 nm in the solid state and a lower HOMO energy level than P3HT. The low - lying HOMO energy levels of these copolymers led to an improved V OC in solar cells compared to P3HT. After optimization of the processing conditions , we show that PDBS - TQx , when used in combination with PC71BM , outperforms P3HT in BHJ solar cells leading to a PCE up to 5.14% under the standard illumination of AM 1.5G , 1000 W m -2 ( active area 0.28 cm^2 ). To further replace advantageously P3HT in tandem or ternarybased devices , the WBG materials should possess an intense absorption coefficient in the 350-650 nm region. UV - visible absorption spectra of the copolymers PDBS - TQx , PDBS - TQxF and PDBS - TzQx were recorded in chloroform solutions and in thin films cast from chlorobenzene solutions. The spectra are presented in Fig. 1a and b for the solution and thin films respectively , and the results are summarized in Table 2. The three polymers show quite similar shape absorption spectra both in solution and in thin films. In solution they show the first maximum absorption peak in the UV part located between 381 nm and 406 nm corresponding to the π-π* tran- sitions. They also possess a second peak that is clearly distinguished at longer wavelengths with a λ max comprised between 526 nm and 546 nm. This second absorption band , typical in D-A chemical structures , corresponds to internal charge - transfer transitions ( ICT ) between the electron - rich and the electron - deficient segments. 48 The absorption profiles of the three polymers are shifted toward longer wavelengths going from the solution to the solid state. In thin films , the maximum of the UV absorption peak is slightly red - shifted by 4 nm to 13 nm , whereas the peak corresponding to the ICT absorption is strongly shifted for all the polymers ( by 19 nm for PDBS - TQx , 27 nm for PDBS - TQxF and 43 nm for PDBS - TzQx ). These behaviours indicate the better delocalization of the electrons of the π-conjugated systems in the solid state and they reflect that strong π-stacking interactions occur between polymer chains ( see Fig. 1b ). It could be noticed that all polymers present really similar absorption profiles with identical band - gaps measured in the solid state. The photoluminescence spectra of the polymers were also recorded in solution and in thin films. We observed a strong shift of the emission peaks from circa 630 nm in solution to circa 720 nm in the solid state ( see Fig. S1 † ). This shift is fully consistent with the better interactions between polymer chains in thin films .",

    "sentence": "Looking closer at the spectra , in addition to the larger bathochromic shifts observed for PDBS - TQxF and PDBS - TzQx , one can notice some features in the ICT absorption bands of these two polymers. This may be an indication that these two polymers give rise to π-stacking interactions in the solid state. To verify this hypothesis X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out on the cast polymer films. All polymers diffract rather weakly , but there are nevertheless distinct diffraction features in pure films that are detected. The presence , in all the diffractograms ( see Fig. 2 ) , of one peak corresponding to distances of 3.10 - 3.15 Å is attributed to silicon substrate. All the three copolymers exhibit one Bragg peak centred in the 17-24 Å d-range which can fit well the periodic lateral distance between the main chains ( Table 1 ). We also note the systematic presence of faint peaks localised between 21 ° < 2θ < 25 ° , corresponding to d-spacings of 4.23 , 4.83 and 4.14 Å for PDBS - TQx , PDBS - TQxF and PDBS - TzQx , respectively. These distances can be considered as average correlation distances separating first neighbouring molecules in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the polymer backbone. 49 These distances stay relatively large because of the van der Waals interactions of alkyl side groups preventing a closer packing of rigid conjugated flat chains. The study by X-ray diffraction measurements of single crystals of monomer DBS precursors as well as TQx , TQxF-Br and TzQx-Br has revealed the planar structure of these different building blocks of the polymer backbones ( see the ESI † ). The crystal structures of the quinoxaline precursors show that the central unit and the thiophene or thiazole spacers are almost coplanar. The monomer TQx showed the highest planarity with dihedral angles between the central quinoxaline and the two adjacent thiophenes around 4.2 ° and 7.0 ° . The quinoxaline unit substituted by fluorine atoms TQxF-Br shows slightly increased dihedral angles up to 4.7 ° and 10.0 ° . However , fluorine atoms give rise to stronger π-stacking interactions since the intermolecular distances between adjacent molecules are around 3.4 Å. The replacement of thiophene spacers by thiazole ones in TzQx-Br increased the dihedral angle values up to 8.9 ° . However the single crystal structure also reveals strong π-stacking interactions between thiazole rings with short intermolecular distances of circa 3.4 Å. Finally , the types of X-ray profiles obtained for PDBS - TQx and for PDBS - TQxF are typical of layered structures exhibiting several orders of Bragg peaks of the same family. For these two polymers , layers of more or less regularly stacked chains can be reasonably assumed. The case of PDBS - TzQx is somewhat different because the presence of a doublet at low scattering angles is a strong indication of a more complex type of chain packing or orientation of the crystallites .",

    "sentence": "Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) of the polymers was carried out in a three - electrode cell using an Ag / AgCl reference electrode and a calibration with the ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) redox couple. The cyclic voltammetry curves are shown in Fig. 3a and the electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2. From the CV curves we found that the oxidation process occurred at 0.94 V for PDBS - TQx , 1.09 V for PDBS - TQxF and 1.31 V for PDBS - TzQx. The onset of the reduction potentials of the polymers was found at -1.27 V and -1.28 V for PDBS - TQx and PDBS - TQxF , respectively but this value was shifted at -1.11 V for PDBS - TzQx. From the ionisation potential and the electronic affinity measured by CV , the corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated using the following equations E HOMO = -(E OX + 4.38 ) ( eV ) and E LUMO = -(E RED + 4.38 ) ( eV ). 50 The HOMO energy level of PDBS - TQx was estimated at -5.32 eV. The substitution of the quinoxaline unit with fluorine atoms in PDBS - TQxF induces a down - shift of the HOMO energy level at -5.47 eV. But , as expected , the strongest effect was observed when the thiophene spacers are replaced by thiazole units. Indeed the polymer PDBS - TzQx possesses a HOMO energy level located at -5.69 eV. In contrast , the impact of the different chemical variations on the LUMO levels is relatively weak. PDBS - TQx and PDBS - TQxF have LUMO levels located at circa -3.10 eV and PDBS - TzQx shows a LUMO level at -3.27 eV. Interestingly all the polymers have a HOMO energy level deeper than the one of the P3HT ( E HOMO = -4.90 eV ) 51,52 ( see Fig. 3b ). This feature is expected to give rise to a higher open circuit voltage for the solar cells . In order to investigate the intrinsic difference between the polymers and to better understand how the chemical modifications influence the energy level positions and the electron density distribution , theoretical calculations were performed by density functional theory using the B3LYP hybrid method. To simplify the calculation , only one set of repeating units of each polymer was used for the calculation and the long alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. The optimisation of the geometry was carried out with the data for each monomer deduced from the single crystal X-Ray diffraction. The simulated electron density distribution and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels with the optimized geometry are shown in Fig. 4. The calculated HOMO energy levels of PDBS - TQx , PDBS - TQxF and PDBS - TzQx were -5.27 eV , -5.38 eV and -5.57 eV respectively.

    "sentence": "These values are quite consistent with the experimental ones found from electrochemical measurements. As expected , the three polymers show an electron density distribution of the LUMO energy levels mainly located on the quinoxaline moiety , which is the most electrondeficient unit in the polymer backbone. However we found that the electron density of the HOMO energy level of PDBS - TQx is rather delocalized on the aromatic cores of the polymer backbone including the benzene ring of the quinoxaline. The fluorine substitutions on PDBS - TQxF , that make the quinoxaline unit more electron deficient , slightly transferred the electron density of the HOMO energy level on the dibenzosilole unit. Finally the use of thiazole spacers in PDBS - TzQx induces a similar effect and increases the contribution of dibenzosilole to the HOMO energy level . The charge carrier mobility of the donor polymer is an important parameter that partly governs the performances of BHJ solar cells. A high charge carrier mobility may contribute to improve the J sc and the Fill Factor ( FF ) leading to a higher PCE. The hole mobility of the copolymers was measured in organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) with a bottom gate and bottom contact configuration. The OFET characteristics are presented in Table 3. PDBS - TQx exhibits a hole mobility of 3.0 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Swapping H for F in the quinoxaline unit allows increasing the hole mobility of PDBS - TQxF up to 1.0 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . After thermal annealing a highest value of 4.5 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 was achieved in the linear regime and this value rises at 6.5 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 in the saturated regime ( see the ESI † ). The lower hole mobility ( circa one order ). Indeed it is well - known that the chain length of the deposited polymers is a determining factor in the fabrication of layers with high carrier mobility. High M w fractions can lead to improved charge transport properties by increasing the conjugation length , the probability of the inter-chain charge carriers hopping and by improving the connectivity between domains. [53][54][55] The rather good hole mobility value for the polymers PDBS - TQxF may originate from a larger crystal size that is usually observed with fluorinated copolymers , probably due to increased π-stacking interactions.",

Several parameters such as the donor - acceptor ratio , the thickness of the active layer , the use of additives and the thermal post-treatment of the thin films were investigated. The results were compared to optimized reference P3HT-PC61BM solar cells measured under the same conditions and to the state of the art P3HT-PC71BM solar cell reported by Sakai and coworkers. 57 Various solvents and additives have been reported in the literature in order to improve the solar cell efficiencies. In this study chlorobenzene , o-dichlorobenzene and paraxylene were tested as the solvent and di-iodo-octane ( DIO ) and anisole were evaluated as an additive to deposit the polymer : PC71BM mixture 58 ( see Table S2 † ). For this class of polymers , it was systematically found that , chlorobenzene with 3% of DIO for processing gives the better performances in photovoltaic devices. The improvement of the PCE mainly originated from a much higher short circuit current density ( J sc ) and a higher fill factor ( FF ). This observation can be rationally explained by studying the morphology of the active layers employing atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) in the tapping mode ( see Fig. S4 † ). Indeed it was found that there was a strong dependency of the morphology of the blends on the processing conditions. The use of DIO as an additive reduces the size of the domains and gives rise to a much better structuration of the two percolating networks and a higher homogeneity of the film. 59,60 The thickness of the active layers was also optimized by analysing its influence on the performances of the devices ( the thickness was varied between 50 nm and 160 nm ). The photovoltaic data are shown in the ESI. † For all the polymers the optimum thicknesses were found to be between 50 and 75 nm. Fig. 5 shows the representative current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves of the three polymers in an optimized device configuration , and their detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 4.",

    "sentence": "Among the three polymers in this study , the best performances were achieved with PDBS - TQx , a V OC of 0.85 V , a J SC of 9.72 mA cm^-2 , a FF of 0.62 and a PCE of 5.14% were obtained for the best cell with this polymer and an average PCE of 4.93% was demonstrated over 5 cells. For this polymer a postfabrication thermal annealing treatment was not effective to improve the performances. These results highlight the higher performances of PDBS - TQx , compared to P3HT in solar cells. The improvement mostly originates from the higher V OC of the solar cells fabricated with this material which is higher by 0.2 V compared to P3HT. The substitution of the quinoxaline with fluorine atoms in PDBS - TQxF has a significant effect on the performances. For this polymer the best cell revealed a V OC of 0.81 V , a J SC of 7.27 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 0.51 leading to a PCE of 2.98% . It should however be noticed that after thermal annealing at 120 °C , the performances increased to reach a PCE of 3.19% with a V OC of 0.76 V , a J SC of 7.61 mA cm^-2 and a FF of 0.55. The performances of the solar cells containing the thiazolebased copolymer PDBS - TzQx were the lowest. In this case the overall operating parameters are decreased to reach a V OC of 0.63 V , a FF of 0.41 and a J SC of 4.92 mA cm^-2 leading to a maximum PCE of 1.27% . As for PDBS - TQx , a thermal annealing of the devices did not yield higher performances. The much lower J SC and FF for the PDBS - TzQx - based devices can be explained by their lower charge carrier mobility as demonstrated earlier. However the origin of the drop in the V OC value is not yet fully understood . The morphology of the polymer : PC71BM blend films with the optimized weight ratio was investigated by tapping - mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). The AFM topographic images are shown in Fig. 6. The morphology of pristine polymers with PC71BM shows aggregated domains with diameters around 500 nm for PDBS - TQx , 300 nm for PDBS - TQxF and 260 nm for PDBS - TzQx ( Fig. 6a-e ). This type of phase segregation is expected to be responsible for the enhanced exciton recombination and the dramatic drop in the current density when the polymers are processed without additives. This morphology also explains why our attempts to improve the morphology of the donor - acceptor networks by a simple thermal treatment were not successful. As explained before , with the goal to enhance the miscibility of the two components and to favour the formation of a better interpenetrating donor - acceptor network , we used DIO as a processing additive.",

    "sentence": "DIO is widely used to enable morphological control in bulk heterojunction materials where thermal annealing is either undesirable or ineffective. When used in a small amount , it can increase the relative solubility of the fullerene compared to the polymer and it ensures that the two materials are well - solubilized in the processing solution. 59 The AFM morphology images confirmed that the aggregate sizes decreased after adding DIO and each blend appeared more homogeneous ( Fig. 6b-f ). Consequently , better photovoltaic properties are obtained with these blends. However due to the limited resolution of the technique it is difficult to confirm that the two types of domains visible in the AFM images correspond to pure materials , they could also correspond to inter-mixed phases. 61 To investigate in more detail the morphology of the active area of our champion cell , i.e. PDBS-TQx:PC71BM we used noncontact AFM ( nc - AFM ) under ultra-high vacuum. 62 In topography ( Fig. 7a ) a fine phase separation is clearly visible. The analysis of the damping images ( Fig. 7b ) revealed a more complex phase structuration. Besides a nano-phase segregation at the 10 nm scale , larger features appear at the 100 nm scale. These data show that , despite the nanometer - scale phase segregation , the relative concentration of the donor and acceptor components varies at the mesoscopic scale. This strongly suggests that further improvement can be expected by achieving an even more homogeneous blend morphology. 61 An important parameter in the performance of the bulk heterojunction solar cells is the charge recombination kinetics , which can be studied by analysing the light intensity dependence. [63][64][65] Light - intensity - dependent J-V characteristics of the PDBS-TQx:PC71BM and PDBS-TQxF:PC71BM blend polymers were measured. This experiment was carried out in order to shed light on the fundamental processes that make PDBS - TQx - based devices ' performances better than the ones of the devices based on PDBS - TQxF. Light intensities from 5.7 to 100 mW cm^-2 were employed and the J-V characteristics of the devices based on PDBS - TQx are shown in Fig. 8a and those for PDBS - TQxF based devices are shown in Fig. 8b. For the devices based on PDBS - TQx , the photocurrent quickly saturated at a low reverse bias , in contrast , for the devices based on PDBS - TQxF the photocurrent saturation is only observed at a high reverse bias as evidenced especially at high illumination. This behavior could be explained by more charge carrier recombination for the devices based on PDBS - TQxF , especially for voltages approaching the V OC . Fig. 9 shows the variation of the J SC as a function of the light intensity for the solar cells based on PDBS-TQx:PC71BM and PDBS-TQxF:PC71BM.",

    "sentence": "In organic solar cells , the dependence of the steady state short circuit current density J SC as a function of the incident light intensity ( I ) can be expressed according to a power law J SC ∞ I α . The physical interpretation of the fitting parameter α is still under debate since it does not give a high - precision measure of the recombination mechanism. However , a fitting parameter α close to 1 is often attributed to a first order loss process whereas a value close to 0.5 is related to a second order ( bimolecular ) loss process. In other words when the α value is close to unity it corresponds to a low bimolecular recombination rate. 66,67 Herein , in both devices investigated , the α values are close to unity , which indicates that monomolecular recombination is the dominant loss mechanism. In organic solar cells , the nature of the main recombination process ( monomolecular versus bimolecular ) can also be determined by the slope of V OC versus ln(I ). Fig. 10 displays the V OC as a function of the light intensity for the solar cells based on PDBS-TQx:PC71BM and PDBS-TQxF:PC71BM. A slope of 2 kT / q is observed in the case of monomolecular recombination where k is the Boltzmann constant , T the temperature and q the elementary charge. For bimolecular recombination , a slope of kT / q is observed. 66 In our case , the slope values for the solar cells based on PDBS - TQx and PDBS - TQxF are equal to 1.29 kT / q and 1.63 kT / q , respectively. This result indicates that monomolecular recombination seems even more pronounced with our fluorinated copolymer , i.e. PDBS - TQxF. Opposite effects have been reported for other classes of fluorinated copolymers containing benzothiadiazole units such as PCPDTBT. 68 Therefore it seems that the introduction of fluorine substituents on the electron - withdrawing units does not lead systematically to a decrease in the charge recombination process . In summary , the synthesis , characterization of the optoelectronic properties , structural organization and photovoltaic properties of a series of wide band gap copolymers based on dibenzosilole and fluorinated or non-fluorinated quinoxaline sub-units connected through thiophene or thiazole segments are described. The copolymers , namely PDBS - TQx , PDBS - TQxF and PDBS - TzQx present an absorption edge close to 650 nm in the solid state and HOMO energy levels comprised between -5.3 eV and -5.7 eV. When they are combined to PC71BM to fabricate bulk - heterojunction solar cells , PCE ranging from 1.27% to 5.14% is achieved. Interestingly one of the new polymers , i.e. PDBS - TQx leads to an increased V oc ( by circa 0.2 V ) and superior solar cell performances compared to a benchmark cell based on P3HT , one of the most known wide band gap polymers in the field.",

By using experimental photocurrent measurement in combination with light intensity dependence , the lower efficiency of PDBS - TQxF is attributed to a higher monomolecular charge recombination rate. Owing to the opto - electronic properties of PDBS - TQx and the quite promising performances of single bulk - heterojunction solar cells , we believe that this material could be valuable to develop tandem devices or ternary blend devices where the complementarity of the absorption domains of the different components is essential to achieve record performances .",

P1 shows a well - distinguished absorption shoulder between 590 and 620 nm attributed to the π-π stacking of a polymer backbone ; such kind of absorption shoulder is not observed in P2 , indicating that the P1 has more planar structure than that of P2. This is due to the fact that the sulfur atom of thiophene spacer and the oxygen atom of carbonyl groups in TPD have more pronounced intramolecular noncovalent interactions ( INCI ) in P1 than that of the sulfur atom of thiophene spacer and the oxygen atom of alkoxy groups of BT in P2. The bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells ( BHJ PSCs ) were fabricated with the configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer ( P1 or P2 ) : PC71BM / LiF / Al.

Upon treating the active layers containing P1 and P2 with methanol , the PCE of the P1 device is increased from 4.19 to 7.14% .

Space charge limited current mobility , atomic force microscopy , transmission electron microscopy , time - of - flight secondary ion mass spectrometry , and impedance spectroscopy studies strongly support the enhanced PCE for the P1 device is attributed to the increased mobility , nanoscale morphology , and reduced resistance upon methanol treatment ; these favorable properties for the P1 polymer are highly correlated with the planarity of the backbone . Even though solution processable bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) are emerging as a potential alternative to silicon based solar cells because of their attractive features such as light weight , flexibility , and low cost , one big hurdle that prevents its commercialization is power conversion efficiency ( PCE ). 1 Substantial research efforts have accelerated the PCE up to 10% through the development of new donor / acceptor materials and device fabrication techniques.",

    "sentence": "2 The ideal characteristics of π-conjugated polymers for BHJ PSCs are to harvest more solar flux , suitable energy levels with fullerene acceptor , high carrier mobility , and appropriate compatibility with fullerene acceptors such as [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl esters ( PC71BM ) to enhance bicontinuous interpenetrating network. 3 Incorporation of appropriate electron - rich and electron - deficient units into the backbone of π-conjugated polymers can offer high short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and fill factor ( FF ) and resulted in high PCEs. 4 However , there is still plenty of scope in designing π-conjugated polymers with deep highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level for PSCs toward commercialization. Until now , research has been mainly focused on the design and synthesis of new donor π-conjugated polymers rather than tailoring the physical properties of existing polymers. Importantly , the relation between the backbone of donor polymer and the morphology of the active layer needs to be studied to gain more insight into ideal molecular design and thus enhance PCEs further. 5 Recently , several research groups have focused on this issue and found some insight between them. 6 Therefore , it is necessary to understand the structure - property relationship while designing appropriate π-conjugated polymers for PSCs. Benzodithiophene ( BDT ) skeleton has been widely applied as a donor unit in π-conjugated polymers due to its highly planar nature and offers an easy way to link various substituents to further improve the backbone planarity and fine - tune the energy levels. 7 In order to improve the photovoltaic properties of BDTbased π-conjugated polymers , the BDT unit was tailored by the introduction of various groups on the central phenyl ring of the BDT unit. This structural modification led to PCEs of above 8% . 8 Particularly , the combination of thiophene and phenyl units , which is the main functionality to enhance the molecular arrangement in the thiophene based liquid crystalline materials , has not yet introduced on the central phenyl ring of BDT for BHJ PSCs. 9 Thus , we aim to observe the effect of such groups attached to the central phenyl ring of BDT on the planarity of resultant backbone , where BDT units were alternately connected to two different electron - deficient units of thieno[3,4-c]-pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( BT ). TPD and BT units have also attracted much attention as electron - deficient units in the synthesis of π-conjugated polymers because of their effectiveness in reduction of band gaps and also in maintenance of deep HOMO energy levels. 10 In addition to such roles as the electron - deficient units , BDT moieties and TPD ( or BT ) moieties can improve the planarity of the backbone via noncovalent interactions between BDT moieties and TPD ( or BT ) moieties. The planarity of the backbone is a key factor to determine the efficiency of resultant PSCs.",

    "sentence": "11,12 The combination of BDT - TPD or BDT-BT can mitigate the backbone twisting issue which often occurred during polymerization reaction due to the unfavorable interaction between the electron - rich and - deficient units in the backbone. With this design strategy we may obtain increased photovoltaic properties of the resultant polymer. It is well - known that the nanoscale morphology of photoactive layer predominantly influence the photovoltaic performance. Thus , several strategies have been proposed to control the Scheme 1 Article dx.doi.org / 10.1021 / ma5010875 | Macromolecules XXXX , XXX , XXX - XXX B morphology of photoactive layers such as thermal annealing , solvent vapor treatment , and high boiling solvent additives. 13 According to recent reports , the usage of conjugated polyelectrolyte interlayer in alcohol or polar solvents like methanol themselves has positive effects on the device performance. 14 Such solvent exposure on the BHJ photoactive layer can influence the crystallinity and morphology of the photoactive film , which resulted in superior photovoltaic characteristics. 15 In this regard , it will be interesting to study the effect of direct polar solvent exposure on the BHJ photoactive layer on the active layer morphology and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. To address the aforementioned issues , we have synthesized two medium band gap ( MBG ) polymers , P1 and P2 , containing m-ethylhexyloxyphenylthiophene ( m-EHPTh ) linked BDT as an electron - rich and TPD or BT as an electron - deficient units , as shown in Scheme 1. To analyze the influence of sulfur and oxygen intramolecular noncovalent interactions ( INCI ) on the planarity of polymer backbone , the thiophene spacer was introduced between the electron - rich and - deficient units of two polymers. We found that the sulfur atom of thiophene and oxygen atom of carbonyl groups of TPD in P1 has more pronounced interaction than the sulfur atom of thiophene and the oxygen atom of alkoxy groups of BT in P2. This difference lead to enhanced planarity of backbone in P1 and resulted in dominant photovoltaic properties of P1 than P2. Thus , the pristine devices of P1 and P2 showed the PCE of 4.19 and 1.88% with a V oc of 0.91 and 0.71 V , respectively. After treating the active layer with methanol , the PCE of the P1 based PSC significantly increased from 4.19 to 7.14% . . All the polymers were readily soluble in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) , chloroform ( CF ) , and chlorobenzene ( CB ). The weight - average molecular weights ( M w ) of P1 and P2 polymers were 36^000 Da with polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 1.2 and 32^000 Da with PDI of 1.3 , respectively. . The onset of decomposition temperatures ( Td , corresponding to 5% weight loss ) of P1 and P2 are 417 and 337 °C , respectively , indicating their very high thermal stability.",

The UV - vis absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in CF solution and film are shown in Figures 1a and 1b , respectively. P1 and P2 show two distinct absorption characteristics ; the bands in the lower energy region 450-700 nm correspond to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) interaction between electron - rich and - deficient units , and the bands in the higher energy region 300-400 nm are attributed to the π-π* transition of polymer backbone. Interestingly , P1 showed a pronounced vibronic shoulder peak between 590 and 620 nm in both solution and film ; in contrast , P2 did not show such a shoulder peak. In addition , the ICT band of P1 has stronger absorption than its π-π* band , whereas in the case of P2 , the π-π* band has higher absorption intensity than its ICT band. These results suggest that the P1 has more planar backbone structure than that of P2. This can be further supported by the UV - vis absorption spectra of P1 in CF solution at various concentrations. As shown in Figure S7 , the intensity of the shoulder peak becomes slightly more pronounced with the increasing concentration of P1 which was not observed in case of P2. The absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in the film were red - shifted compared to their solution spectra , indicating their efficient π-π stacking in film state. Particularly , the film of P1 shows almost equal relative intensity of the ICT band and the shoulder peak confirms again its more planar nature than P2. Taken together , the results presented suggest that the INCI between sulfur atom of thiophene spacer and the oxygen atom of carbonyl groups in TPD is more pronounced than the INCI between the sulfur atom of thiophene and the oxygen atom of alkoxy groups in BT. Electrochemical Properties. The electrochemical properties of P1 and P2 were measured using cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) ; the corresponding cyclic voltammograms are shown in Figure S8 , and the data are listed in Table 1. The HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were determined from their onset of first oxidation potentials. P1 possesses a deeper HOMO ( -5.42 eV ) than the P2 ( -5.34 eV ) , which may enable a high V oc for the P1 , since V oc values mainly depend on the difference between HOMO energy level of the donor and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of the acceptor materials. This may be due to the existence of higher electron - withdrawing nature of TPD unit in P1 than that of the BT in P2. In addition , P1 and P2 show the HOMO energy level below the air oxidation threshold limit ( 5.2 eV ) , which suggests their high air stability.",

    "sentence": "Their LUMO energy levels were calculated from their optical band gap ( E g opt ) and HOMO energy levels. The LUMO energy level of the donor materials has to be at least 0.3 eV higher than that of the acceptor materials in BHJ PSCs to ensure formation of a downhill driving force for the energetically favorable electron transfer and to overcome the binding energy of the intrachain exciton. P1 and P2 show the LUMO values ( -3.66 and -3.60 eV , respectively ) greater than 0.3 eV of LUMO of PC71BM. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the P1 and P2 clearly indicate their good air stability and efficient exciton dissociation at donor / acceptor interfaces , respectively. 18 Computational Study. Density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations were carried out to further inspect electrochemical properties of P1 and P2 using a suite of Gaussian 09 programs. 19 Becke 's three parametrized Lee-Yang-Parr exchange functional ( B3LYP ) and 6-31G* basis sets were used. Optimized structures , HOMOs , and LUMOs of repeating units of P1 and P2 are shown in Figure 2. The electronic densities of their HOMOs are more populated on the BDT units , and those of the LUMOs are mainly distributed over TPD or BT units , as expected. The HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were calculated to be -4.96 and -4.82 eV , respectively. These results are in agreement with experimental observations of deeper HOMO energy levels in the P1 than the P2. This HOMO difference can be understood by the more electronic participation of the thiophene spacers next to the BT units. In addition , the planarity of the optimized structures of repeating units of P1 and P2 were observed through the dihedral angles between the electron donor and the electron - deficient units. In both P1 and P2 , the dihedral angles between BDT unit and thiophene spacer were similar , 13.4 ° and 15.5 ° , respectively. In contrast , the dihedral angles between thiophene and each electron - deficient unit of P1 and P2 were 0 ° and 9.8 ° , respectively. Hence , the computed dihedral angles suggest enhanced planarity in P1 than in P2 though both electron deficient moieties are planar as we expected. 11,20 As for electrostatic interactions , calculated Mulliken charge distribution shows an almost equal degree of charge separation between the sulfur atom of thiophene and the oxygen atom of each acceptor unit in both repeating units. The larger dihedral angle in P2 than in P1 mainly originated from the steric repulsion between the lengthy hydrocarbon chain of the electron deficient unit and the APTh of the donor. X-ray Diffraction. The crystallinity of the polymers was characterized by the X-ray diffraction technique. Both the polymers are quite low crystalline ( Figure S9 ). From ( 100 ) reflections we estimated similar lamellar domain spacings to be 29.9 Å ( q = 0.21 Å -1 ) for both P1 and P2 , respectively , in the polymer : PC71BM blend films.",

In order to understand the effect of INCI in P1 and P2 on their photovoltaic properties , the BHJ PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / P1 or P2 : PC71BM / LiF / Al and tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G illumination ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). The active layers of the devices were spin - coated from the CB solution of corresponding polymer and PC71BM blend. In order to obtain the best device performance , several device and processing conditions such as polymer to PC71BM ratio , active layer thickness , and processing solvent were systematically optimized. The best photovoltaic properties were obtained with the blend ratio of 1 : 2.5 and 1 : 2 for the P1 and P2 devices , respectively. Figures 3a and 3b show the current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves of best devices of pristine and methanol - treated P1 and P2 devices , and the data are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. The best device of pristine P1 yielded the PCE of 4.19% with the J sc of 9.50 mA / cm^2 , V oc 0.91 V , and FF 48.31% , which is higher than that of the best device of the pristine P2 ( PCE : 1.88% ). This can be explained from its broader absorption spectrum and higher carrier mobilities of the P1 : PC71BM blend than that of the P2 : PC71BM blend. Additionally , the P1 device shows a higher V oc than that of the P2 device due to its deeper HOMO energy level since the V oc mainly depends on the HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor. Because of the higher carrier mobilities of the P1 : PC71BM blend , it shows higher FF and J sc values than those of the P2 : PC71BM blend , which leads to the higher PCE for the P1 device than the P2 device ( vide inf ra ). Recently postdeposition methanol treatment has proven to be an effective method to obtain nanoscale morphology for active layer by controlling the phase separation between donor and acceptor. Methanol has been widely used in surface engineering by incorporation of interlayer in BHJ PSCs. 23 In this regard , we were keen to observe the effect of methanol treatment on the active layer and its correlation on the planarity of polymer backbone , which is the main determining factor of photovoltaic performances. As shown in Figure 3a , after treating the active layer with methanol , the PCE is increased drastically from 4.19 to 7.14% for the P1 device ; in contrast , the PCE is decreased from 1.88 to 1.82% for the P2 device.",

    "sentence": "We conjecture that the increased photovoltaic performance by methanol treatment is mainly related with the planarity of polymer backbone. When polymer chains are planar , the PC71BM molecules may migrate more easily between the polymer chains than the polymers with nonplanar backbones , which then effectively increase the interfacial area between the polymers and the PC71BM molecules with maintaining nanoscopically connected each domain. This is supported by results of the photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching , mobility measurements , and morphology studies ( vide inf ra ). Thus , the PCE of the more planar P1 device is increased more drastically than that of the P2 device. Wetting time is a crucial factor in the methanol treatment to increase the PCE. 24 Thus , the wetting time was optimized for both the P1 and P2 devices. As shown in Table 3 , the PCE of the P1 device is increased from 4.19 to 7.14% with increasing the wetting time from 0 to 20 s due to the increment in J sc ( from 9.50 to 13.20 mA / cm^2 ) and FF ( from 48.3 to 55.9% ). Upon increasing the wetting time further above 20 s , the PCE is gradually decreased due to the decrease in J sc and FF values. In contrast , the P2 device does not show such changes after treating with methanol. This is due to the fact that the migration of PC71BM molecule in the presence of methanol is blocked by unfavorable polymer backbone. It means that the movement of PC71BM molecules in the active layer of the P1 device is more favorable than that in the P2 device in the presence of methanol. As shown in Figures 4a and 4b , a pristine blend of both the polymers covers the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) from 300 to 700 nm , which are well matched with their absorption patterns. Particularly , the P1 device shows the EQE of around 50% in the 300-700 nm region. In contrast for the P2 device , the EQE is decreased to 45% between 600 and 700 nm regions. Very interestingly , after treating the active layer with methanol , the EQE is increased above 65% from 50% for the P1 device ; thus , the J sc is increased 9.50 to 13.20 mA / cm^2. In the case of the P2 device , the EQE does not show much change after treating with methanol. Thus , the efficiency of the P1 device is increased drastically after treating with methanol while that of the P2 device remains similar. The J sc values ( 8.94 and 11.93 mA / cm^2 for pristine and methanol - treated P1 based devices ) calculated from integration of the EQE spectra were well matched with J sc obtained from the J-V measurements , considering the common error of 5-10 % .",

    "sentence": "25 The enhanced performance , especially the increase in FF after solvent treatment , is attributed to the rise in shunt resistance ( R sh ) and lowering of series resistance ( R s ) of the device. The R sh increased from 0.64 to 1.40 kΩ , and the R s decreased from 6.3 to 3.52 Ω cm^2 after solvent treatment. 26 In order to gain more insight into the methanol treatment on enhanced efficiency , the PL quenching studies in the presence of PC71BM acceptor were carried out. PL spectra were measured for P1 and P2 in film state with and without of PC71BM. Both P1 and P2 displayed the emission in the range of 600-750 nm with a peak maximum at 662 and 681 nm , respectively. Upon blending 5. The PL is further quenched after treating the P1 : PC71BM blend film with methanol. In contrast , the PL is slightly increased after treating with P2 : PC71BM blend film with methanol. Here , we clearly observed the role of methanol : in the case of P1 , the feasibility of exciton dissociation process in the P1 : PC71BM blend is increased further by methanol treatment , but in the case of P2 , the exciton dissociation process is decreased , which is consistent with the slightly diminished performance of the P2 device upon treating with methanol. The aforementioned discussions can be realized by the planarity of backbone of both the polymers. To understand further the origin of enhanced J sc and FF after methanol treatment , charge transport properties were investigated by the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method. The photocurrent in the BHJ PSCs combines contributions of both the hole and the electron mobilities. J-V curves of electron - only or hole - only devices are shown in Figure S10 , and the hole and electron mobilities are shown in Table S2. The hole and electron mobilities of the P1 based device were increased after treating with methanol and became better balanced ( μ e / μ h = 2.25 → 1.3 ) , which is consistent with the enhanced J sc and FF resulting in the increased PCE. In contrast , in the case of the P2 based device , there is no significant improvement in carrier mobilities after methanol treatment revealed the poor device performance of the P2 device. Morphological Studies. To understand the effect of planarity of polymer backbone on the morphology of active layers before and after the methanol treatment for both the polymer : PC71BM blends , the morphology of the active layer was examined by using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). AFM images of both P1 and P2 based active layers before and after methanol treatment are shown in Figure 6. When comparing the morphology of pristine blend of both polymers , the P1 : PC71BM film exhibited nanoscopically aggregated domains , while the P2 : PC71BM displayed finely mixed domains with some dark spots.",

    "sentence": "After methanol treatment , in the case of P1 aggregate sizes decreased and each material appears to be more homogeneously mixed probably due to the infiltration of PC71BMs between polymer chains. Thus , the polymer : PC71BM interfacial area increased after treating the active layer of P1 : PC71BM by methanol , which resulted in higher PCE. In the case of the P2 : PC71BM blend , no significant change was observed on the domain sizes before and after methanol treatment. Thus , the PCE of the devices based on P2 did not increase upon treating it with methanol. The effects of solvent treatment on BHJ PSCs of P1 and P2 were further investigated by time - of - flight secondary ion mass spectrometry ( TOF - SIMS ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) techniques. TOF - SIMS depth profiling did not show meaningful difference between methanol - untreated and methanol - treated polymer : PC71BM blend films ( Figure S11 ). However , TEM imaging revealed the morphological change upon methanol treatment ( Figure 7 ). The TEM image of the P1 : PC71BM blend film showed unfavorablely phase - separated morphology with polymer aggregates ( white spots in Figure 7a ) whereas the methanol - treated film in ( Figure 7b ) showed much well - dispersed nanoscopic polymer and PC71BM domains. By contrast , in the case of the P2 : PC71BM blend film such dramatic change did not appear. This observed morphological development is consistent with the XRD data and AFM images. Importantly , the desirable morphological change should be related with the much improved photovoltaic performance , carrier mobility , and low bulk resistance ( vide inf ra ) in the methanol - treated P1 : PC71BM devices. Impedance Spectroscopy Studies. To further study the enhancement of photovoltaic performance due to the effect of methanol treatment , photovoltaic devices were analyzed using alternating current ( ac ) impedance spectroscopy ( IS ). 27,28 The highly improved V oc due to solvent treatment were studied with capacitance (C)-voltage ( V ) characteristics , and data were analyzed using Mott - Schottky ( MS ) analysis. 29 Figure 8 show Nyquist plots of impedance measurement of P1 : PC71BM devices with and without methanol treatment for frequencies from 500 Hz to 1 MHz. The data were fit by using equivalent circuit ( EC ) as shown in the inset of Figure 8 for both , with and without methanol treated devices. These plots were substantially consistent with fitting curve simulated by an EC. The R s corresponds to series resistance consisting of ohmic components. The R1 and C1 correspond to bulk resistance and capacitance , whereas the R2 and C2 correspond to depletion layer functioning. The methanol treated device has a significantly reduced bulk resistance as indicated by the decreased radius in the Nyquist plot.

To estimate V bi , the C-V characteristics of the P1 : PC71BM devices with and without methanol treatment were examined using the Mott- Schottky equation ε ε = - - C V V Ae N 2 ( ) / 2 bi 2 r 0 Here , V , e , ε r , ε 0 , N , A , and C respectively denote the external bias voltage in the range of -0.4 to + 1.4 V , elementary charge , relative dielectric constant ( ε r = 3 ) , permittivity in vacuum , charge carrier concentration , device active area , and capacitance obtained using the above methods for each bias voltage. The linear region under From Figure 9b , we obtained V bi of 1.03 V and N of 5.66 × 10^16 cm^-3 . The increase in V bi may be considered to be the reason for enhancement of V oc after solvent treatment because the V bi plays a key role in the internal electric field of BHJ solar cells. It pushes the V oc to a higher level , given that the work function difference of electrodes is larger than the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO offset of the BHJ. 32 The higher order of N showed enhanced charge density in the case of methanol - treated devices . Two MBG polymers , P1 and P2 , have been synthesized successfully via microwave - assisted Stille polymerization to understand the role of electron - deficient units on the planarity of polymer backbone and its effect on the photovoltaic properties. The well - distinguished shoulder peak observed between 590 and 620 nm for P1 confirms the efficient π-π stacking of a polymer backbone. In contrast , the P2 does not show such a shoulder peak , indicating that the P1 has more planar backbone than that of P2.",

    "sentence": "The best device of P1 showed the maximum PCE of 4.19% with the V oc of 0.91 V whereas the best device of P2 showed the PCE of only 1.88% with the V oc of 0.71 V. This can be realized by the exhibition of highly planar backbone of P1 than that of P2 because the INCI interaction between the sulfur atom of thiophene spacer and oxygen atom of carbonyl groups in TPD is higher than that of the sulfur atom of thiophene spacers and oxygen atom of alkoxy groups in BT , which lead to increases the carrier mobilities of P1 than P2. After treating the active layer of both P1 and P2 by methanol , the PCE is increased from 4.19 to 7.14% for P1 , but the PCE is decreased from 1.88 to 1.82% for P2. The higher photovoltaic properties of the P1 : PC71BM blend upon treating its active layer by methanol originates from the increased charge carrier mobilities , more balanced charge transport , and the formation of well - mixed interpenetrating morphologies than those of the P2 : PC71BM blend. Therefore , we conclude that the effect of methanol treatment on the enhanced efficiency is strongly associated with the planarity of the backbone of the polymers because the migration of PC71BM molecules between the polymer chains in the presence of methanol is highly feasible in the polymers with planar backbone , which has never been observed before even though the efficiency increment in PSCs by methanol treated are reported elsewhere .",

As the content of chlorine is increased in polymers , the twist angle between the donor and acceptor is increased , which leads to a diminishment in the planarity and conjugation. As a result , the UV - vis absorption is continuous blue - shifted , and the band gap increases from 1.57 to 2.04 eV when the chlorinated moieties increased from 0 to 100% . The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) levels of those polymers are decreased by increasing the content of chlorinated moiety , which opens a window to constantly modify the V oc values and eventually meets a balance point for optimized solar energy conversion. The highest power conversion efficiency of 8.31% is obtained by using PBTCl25 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , in which the V oc increased from 0.79 to 0.82 V after 25% chlorinated monomer involved in copolymerization. Herein , the chlorine replacement could be a good method to further pump the solar conversion by increasing the open circuit voltage without reducing other factors of the polymer solar cells . To solve the increasingly serious energy crisis and the environmental problem caused by conventional energy , searching for and developing green renewable energy such as solar energy are very necessary and important. The past two decades has seen an enormous emergence and development of polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) in both academic research and industrial application owing to their tremendous advantages compared with the traditional silicon solar cells. Organic photovoltaic cells ( OPVs ) show advantages which include low cost , lightweight , solution processing ability , and flexibility. In particular , the creation of the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) system , which is usually employed with conjugated polymer as the electron donor and fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor , is considered as a landmark in the studies of OPVs. 1,2 Particularly , the extensive research on the donor - acceptor ( D- A ) conjugated polymers 3-8 has greatly enhanced the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSCs in the past decades. Considered the three main factors related to the PCE of polymer solar cellsthe short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and fill factor (FF)the simultaneous enhancement of those factors becomes the basic goal when designing the new polymer for solar energy conversion. First , the J sc value depends on the absorption in the range of the visible and near - infrared regions as well as the carrier mobilities in blend films. Thus , polymers with low band gaps and relatively planar structures will be good for the more optimal J sc values.",

At the same time , it is important to maintain a minimum energy offset between the LUMO levels of the donor and fullerene acceptor in order to provide a sufficient driving force for an effective charge separation. 15 That means an ideal design of low band gap polymer for high efficient solar energy conversion would be modestly lower the HOMO level of a donor material with minimal effect on its LUMO level to achieve optimized open circuit voltage and efficient charge carrier transfer between D-A layer interface. The PTB family polymers with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) and thieno [3,4-b]thiophene ( TT ) units are one of the most efficient classes of D-A materials and have drawn a vast majority of attention and interest in the past several years. 16-27 BDT , as a main building block of these polymers , has structural features including extended conjugations , high planarity , and small steric hindrance with adjacent units. Meanwhile , the TT unit with a carboxyl group which was utilized to stabilize the highly electron - deficient TT unit could narrow the energy gap of resulting polymers by the formation of quinoidal structure along the backbone. 21 The pioneer work was reported by 16,17 a PCE of over 6% had been achieved from PTB1 ( Chart 1a ).

What is more , chlorinated molecules are much more accessible through chemical synthesis in comparison to the corresponding fluorinated one. Although n-channel organic transistors based on chlorinated PDI and NDI derivatives have been reported , 37-42 the chlorination of conjugated polymers has not been reported until 2013 by Pei et al. about chlorinated isoindigo polymers. 43,44 In this work , the chlorinated TT unit was introduced in PBT polymers through diazotization-chlorination reaction , 45 and a new series of thieno [3,4-b]thiophene-benzodithiophene terpolymers ( PBTClx ) via a triple - component copolymerization approach with a certain ratio of chlorinated and fluorinated TT units were synthesized and studied. The concept of triple component random copolymerization has recently been developed as an effective way to adjust the band gap and energy levels of the conjugated polymers. 46-49 In order to improve the photovoltaic performances of the polymer systems , we found that the number of chlorinated TT groups should be controlled very carefully to reach the optimized condition , as the morphology and photovoltaic performance are usually affected by the planarity of the conjugated polymers which could be distorted by the steric hindrance of chlorine atoms. Interestingly , our results indicate that polymer PBTCl25 which contains 25% chlorinated TT performs a PCE of 8.31% , which is about 5% higher than PTB7-Th ( 7.91% ) in our parallel experiments , mainly due to the improved open circuit voltage from 0.79 to 0.82 V and enhanced structural orderings for better hole mobility up 6.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Notably , it is found that the open circuit voltage of these terpolymers will continuously increasing from 0.79 to 0.90 V when the chlorinated TT increased from 0 to 100% , which opens a window to adjust the energy levels and optimize the performance of PSCs by a chlorine replacement . . The gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) measurements showed average molecular weights of 58.3 , 60.7 , 75.2 , 98.4 , 90.1 , 58.6 , and 24.0 kDa for PTB7-Th , PBTCl10 , PBTCl20 , PBTCl25 , PBTCl50 , PBTCl75 , and PBTCl , respectively. The polydispersity index ( PDI ) of these polymers was determined to be about 2.0 - 4.3. All the polymers are soluble in chloroform ( CHCl 3 ) , chlorobenzene ( CB ) , and 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ).",

Optical and Electrochemical Properties. Figure 2 shows the comparison of the ultraviolet / visible ( UV - vis ) absorption spectra of the polymers both in dilute chloroform ( 10^-6 mol L -1 ) and in thin films. From PBTCl , PBTCl75 , PBTCl50 , PBTCl25 , PBTCl20 , and PBTCl10 to PTB7-Th , gradually red - shifted absorption peaks are observed as the chlorine content decreases , indicating that the packing of the polymers is highly affected by the chlorine and fluorine content. As the content of chlorine is increased in the copolymer , the twist angle between the donor and acceptor is increased due to the steric hindrance of chlorine atoms , which leads to a diminishment in the planarity and conjugation of the copolymers. In chloroform solution , all the polymers show π-π* transition peaking from 624 to 697 nm and vibronic shoulders from 574 to 633 nm , respectively. The intensity of the vibronic shoulder is weaker than the main peak when the content of chlorine is less than 25% , and its intensity grows as the chlorine content increases and exceeds the main peak when the content of chlorine is more than 50% . The results indicate that those polymers in solution already exist in very strong aggregation when the ratio of chlorine and fluorine reaches at some degree , such as 50% chlorinated monomers in this case , but the majority of chlorine substitution in terpolymer will weaken the intermolecular aggregation by the steric hindrance of chlorine atoms and eventually lead to the blue - shift of the absorption spectra in solution. Therefore , the controlling of different halogen atoms in terpolymer is critical for suitable intermolecular interactions , and with proper ratio of chlorine , the lower HOMO can be achieved without destroying the aggregations of the fluorine - substituted polymers. The absorptions of the polymer thin films exhibit similar optical properties to that in solution but with obvious red - shift of the main peaks. The main and shoulder peaks are red - shifted about 7-20 nm and 17-29 nm from the solution to film , respectively. The relative intensities of the π-π* transition peak are the strongest peaks in thin films of all polymers even the content of chlorine is the majority in copolymers , which imply the ordered aggregation and strong π-π stacking of polymer in thin films.",

    "sentence": "Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to measure the polymers ' oxidation / reduction onset potentials. As shown in Figure 3 , it can be found that the reduction onset values of all polymers are very similar , and the main difference of them is the oxidation onset values ( from 0.93 to 0.49 eV ). From the values of E ox and E red of the polymers , the HOMO and the LUMO as well as the electrochemical band gaps were calculated and are listed in Table 1. The chlorine substitution obviously decreased the HOMO values of the polymers , with a difference of 0.44 eV obtained between the highest chlorinated and the fluorinated polymers , because of the introduction of the electron - accepting chlorine atom substituents on TT ring. The lower HOMO energy level was propitious to achieving better stability of the corresponding polymers and higher open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the corresponding bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells. 50 Therefore , a higher V oc for PBTCl - based polymer solar cells could be anticipated. Theoretical Calculations. Molecular simulation using density functional theory ( DFT ) was conducted to identify the structure - property relationship of the synthesized polymers. The DFT calculations were carried out using Gaussian 09 with the hybrid B3LYP correlation functional and split - valence 6-31G(d) basis set. Oligomers with two BDT units and one TT-Cl / TT-F unit were selected for the calculation. The alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups to save the computational time within a reasonable simplification. The calculated HOMO and LUMO orbitals are shown in Figure 4. The HOMO orbitals are delocalized along the whole π-conjugated backbones , and the LUMO orbitals are localized on the acceptor thieno [3,4-b]thiophene unit due to both fluorine and chlorine having high electron affinity , which exhibits strong electron - withdrawing characteristics. The trend of variation for molecular orbital energy levels is consistent with the results obtained from the CV measurements. The dihedral angles between BDT unit and TT unit were measured according to Figure 4 , and the results are summarized in Table 2. Based on these results , the internal steric hindrance of the polymers was observed according to the different electron - withdrawing group. Dihedral angle 1 was 21.3 ° in PBTCl and 20.1 ° in PTB7-Th , which decreased by only 1.2 ° b ecause the position of dihedral angle 1 was on the opposite side of halogen on TT unit. Meanwhile , dihedral angle 2 of PBTCl was 56.8 ° and that of PTB7-Th was 28.3 ° , which decreased by 28.5 ° because of the more steric hindrance of chlorine than fluorine atom. As the steric effect was increased in the chlorinated copolymer , the twist angle between the donor and acceptor was increased , which led to a diminishment in the planarity and conjugation. The band gap will be enlarged with the decreasing of HOMO and increasing of LUMO levels. Photovoltaic Properties.",

    "sentence": "To demonstrate the influence of the fluorine and chlorine on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers PBTClx , we fabricated the solar cell devices with a structure of ITO / ZnO / PBTClx : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag. Herein , the method was used in the device optimization with a 1 : 1.5 donor - acceptor blend ratio using chlorobenzene as a processing solvent containing 3% of 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) as additive. The optimized thicknesses of the active layers varied from 90 to 170 nm due to the different molecular weight. Figure 5a and Table 3 present the current density - voltage ( J- V ) curves and the performance of the devices from all the polymers with different chlorine ratio. As expected , when the content of chlorine moiety is increased in the terpolymer , the V oc exhibits a higher value due to the relative lower - lying HOMO energy levels of the donor materials. 51 PBTCl showed a V oc of 0.92 V , which is 0.13 V larger than that obtained from the PTB7 - Th. Interestingly , when the content of chlorine moiety is about 25% , the PSC device based on PBTCl25 gives the highest PCE in those polymers , which is 8.31% with a V oc of 0.82 V , a J sc of 15.31 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 66.19% . Compared with PTB7-Th , the PCE of terpolymer PBTCl25 is about 5% increasing after appropriate chlorinated moiety added into the polymer chain , which also indicated that the chlorination could be an effective method to promote the solar energy conversion by enlarge the open circuit voltage with minimal effluence of other factors or even enhancement at same time. Figure 5b shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of all polymers. The EQE spectrum displayed a broad photoresponse from 300 to 800 nm. The maximal EQE value of polymer PBTCl25 reaches about 70% from 630 to 700 nm , and the integral current density calculated based on the EQE curve is 15.05 mA cm^-2 . The deviations between the measured J sc values and the J sc values calculated from the EQE spectra are within 5% , showing a good agreement of the photovoltaic results. The hole mobility of the copolymers was tested by the SCLC method with the single carrier devices ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PBTClx : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag. As shown in the Table 3 and Figure S1 , from the polymer PBTCl to PBTCl25 , increasing fluorine content enhances the hole mobility from the 5.5 × 10^-5 to 6.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The PBTCl25 - based device exhibits the highest hole mobility among all the polymers , which is consistent with the highest PCE of the polymer. Morphology Investigation. It is well - known that the nanoscale morphology plays a crucial role in the charge separation and transfer for the organic film solar cells.",

    "sentence": "To characterize the film morphologies of the copolymers , we chose tapping mode AFM as the method. The films were prepared by spin - coating PBTClx : PC71BM blend following the method for the solar cell devices. As shown in Figure 6a-c GIWAXS Analysis. The molecular orientation of PBTClx polymer chains in the PBTClx : PC71BM blend films was studied by grazing incidence wide - angle X-ray scattering ( GIWAXS ). Figure 7 shows 2D GIWAXS patterns and corresponding q r and q z linecuts of the films of four conjugated polymers , PBTCl , PBTCl75 , PBTCl25 , and PTB7-Th , blended with PC71BM. Obvious diffraction peaks of the blended films were observed around q r ≈ 0.30 Å -1 ( Figure 7e ) and could be assigned to the ( 10 ) reflection of the 2D hexagonal lattice and correspond to the lattice parameters of a hexagonal array , L 0 , of 23.5 , 23.7 , 25.2 , and 24.8 Å , respectively. This revealed their semicrystalline nature and preferential face-on orientation in the blended films. As the degree of chlorine substitution increases , these scattering peaks shift to a slightly higher q r ( 0.308 Å -1 for PBTCl , 0.306 Å -1 for PBTCl75 , 0.288 Å -1 for PBTCl25 , and 0.293 Å -1 for PTB7-Th ). Moreover , the π-π stacking scatterings were only observed at q z = 1.58 Å -1 in the blended films of PBTCl25 and PTB7-Th ( 3.40 Å for both polymers ) and remain unchanged upon the substitution. For PBTCl only with chlorine substitution , the π-π stacking distances slightly increased to 3.43 Å from the GIWAXS measurement. Apparently , the chlorine substitution just increases the packing distance of polymer chains a little bit in the blended films , rather than having significant influence on molecular packing. From the full width at half - maximum ( FWHM ) of these scattering peaks , it is evident that PBTCl25 exhibits an improved crystallinity in contract to the other three polymers. Both the improved molecular ordering and face-on molecular orientation facilitated the interchain π-electron transport in these conjugated polymer films and led to the high power conversion efficiency of 8.31% in the PBTCl25 : PC71BM - based device . The goal of the current work has been to improve the photovoltaic performance in the electron donor polymers based on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) and thieno [3,4b]thiophene ( TT ) units system. We want to take the advantage of steric effects of chlorine atoms in the polymer systems , which included large band gap , suitable HOMO and LUMO levels , and higher V oc value. We propose that the number of TT-Cl groups should be controlled very carefully to reach the most optimized morphology and planarity of the conjugated system , through a triple component copolymerization approach with different amounts of TT-Cl and TT-F , to realize a better photovoltaic performance in the fabrication of solar cell device.",

    "sentence": "A new polythiophene derivative with octyl diphenylamine-vinylene conjugated side chains , DPAV-PT , was synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction , and characterized by 1H NMR , GPC , TGA , UV - Vis absorption spectroscopy , and cyclic voltammetry. The copolymer is readily soluble in the common organic solvents and exhibits good thermal stability with 5% weight loss temperature of 267 C. DPAV-PT possesses a broad absorption band at 300-650 nm ( with an optical bandgap of 1.85 eV ). Cyclic voltammetry displays a HOMO energy level of -5.01 eV. The weight average molecular weight ( M w ) of DPAV-PT is 3.1 x 10^4 with the polydispersity index of 1.3. A polymer solar cell with the configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / DPAV - PT : PCBM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) / Ca / Al has a power conversion efficiency of 0.7% under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . The field effect hole mobility of the polymer reached 6.1 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with an on / off ratio of 10^3 and a threshold voltage of -7 V after 180 °C annealing . Conjugated polymers have been the subject of much research in recent years due to their promising applications in electroluminescence ( EL ) , 1 organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) , 2 electrochromic devices ( ECDs ) , 3 solar cells 4 and sensors. 5 In particular , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted considerable attention due to their unique attractive properties such as being lightweight , flexible and low cost. For the conjugated polymers in PSCs as electron donor , broad absorption and higher hole mobility play important role for efficient photovoltaic materials. 6 To this end , Li and co-workers do much original work on side chain conjugated polythiophenes. For example , their group synthesized a series of polythiophene and poly(thienylene vinylene ) derivatives with conjugated phenylene-vinylene , 7 thienylene-vinylene , 8 terthiophene-vinylene 9 or phenothiazine vinylene side chains. 10 The polymers with the conjugated side chains showed broad absorption in the visible region and higher hole mobility , [7][8][9][10] therefore leading to PCE of up to 3.2% . 8 OFETs attracted extensive interest due to their promising potentials in sensors , low - cost large area memories , smart cards , and driving circuits for large - area displays. 11 Easy processability and good compatibility with flexible plastic substrates offer excellent opportunities for polymers in fabricating low - cost OFETs. Although much effort has been devoted to this , to date the excellent semiconductors are still limited. Therefore , design and synthesis of new conjugated polymers for FETs are of great interest. Diphenylamine ( DPA ) is a well - known hole transporting unit. To the best of our knowledge , the photovoltaic and field effect properties of DPA - based polymers have been scarcely explored.",

    "sentence": "Based on this information , in order to shed light on the effect of DPA structure on the properties of the conjugated side chain polythiophene derivatives , we synthesized a new polythiophene derivative with octyl diphenylamine units as conjugated side chains , DPAV-PT ( see Scheme 1 ) , via the Stille coupling reaction. A polymer solar cell with the configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / DPAV - PT : PCBM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) / Ca / Al was fabricated , and the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 0.7% was obtained under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 , which is higher than that of triphenylamine vinylene conjugated polythiophene derivative , OTPAV-PT ( PCE : 0.2% ). 12 The reason may be from its broader absorption and relatively higher hole mobility due to its better planarity. The field effect hole mobility of the polymer reached 6.1 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with an on / off ratio of 10^3 . Thermal stability of the polymer is important for device fabrication. Fig. 2 displays the TGA thermogram of DPAV - PT. The TGA analysis reveals that , under the protection of an inert atmosphere , the onset points of the weight loss ( 5% ) of DPAV-PT is ca. 267 C. T g was not observed in the DSC thermogram. Good thermal stability of the resulting copolymer prevents the deformation of the copolymer morphology and the degradation of the polymeric active layer under applied electric fields . The photophysical characteristic of the polymer DPAV-PT was investigated by UV - Vis absorption spectra in dilute chloroform solution and in solid film spinning - coated on a quartz substrate. Fig. 3 shows the UV - Vis absorption spectra of the polymer solution and film. In solution , DPAV-PT shows an absorption peak at ca. 378 nm and a shoulder at ca. 502 nm. The peak of 378 nm belongs to the absorption of the diphenylamine-vinylene conjugated side chains , and the 502 nm shoulder peak could be ascribed to the p-p* transition absorption of the conjugated polythiophene main chains. The main chain absorption of the polymer film in the visible region got broadened , red - shifted in comparison with that of the polymer solution , because of the aggregation and stronger interchain interactions between the conjugated main chains of the conjugated polymer. The absorption edge of the polymer film is at ca. 670 nm , corresponding to an optical bandgap ( E opt g ) of 1.85 eV. 13 The onset oxidation and reduction potentials obtained from the cyclic voltammograms correspond to the HOMO and LUMO energy levels , respectively. 14,15 Fig. 4 shows cyclic voltammograms of a DPAV-PT film on a Pt electrode with 0.1 mol L -1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate ( Bu 4 NPF 6 ) / CH 3 CN as the electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s^-1 .",

    "sentence": "It can be seen that DPAV-PT exhibits quasi-reversible or reversible p - doping / dedoping ( oxidation / re-reduction ) processes over a positive potential range and irreversible n - doping / dedoping ( reduction / re-oxidation ) processes over a negative potential range. In a positive potential region , the onset oxidation potential ( E ox on ) is 0.3 V vs. Ag / Ag + for DPAV - PT. In the negative potential region , the onset reduction potential ( E red on ) located at -1.75 V vs. Ag / Ag + for DPAV - PT. From the onset oxidation potential ( E ox on ) and the onset reduction potential ( E red on ) of the polymer DPAV-PT , we calculated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer according to the equations. 16 HOMO= -e(E ox on + 4.71 ) ( eV ) LUMO= -e(E red on + 4.71 ) ( eV ). The E LUMO and E HOMO values of DPAV-PT are -2.96 eV and -5.01 eV , respectively , and the corresponding electrochemical bandgap ( E EC g ) was 2.05 eV. The electrochemical bandgap is slightly larger than the optical bandgap due probably to the interface barrier for the charge injection . The optimal geometries and electronic state wavefunction distribution of HOMO and LUMO of the model compound ( monomer ) were obtained at the DFT B3LYP / 6-31G* level using the Gaussian 03 program suit ( Fig. 5 ). 17 To simplify the calculations , the alkyl chain was replaced by a -CH 3 group. DFT / B3LYP / 6-31G* has been found to be an accurate method for Fig. 3 The absorption spectra of the polymer DPAV-PT in CHCl 3 and film. calculating the optimal geometry and electronic structures of many molecular systems. Ab intitio calculations on the model compound for DPAV-PT show that the electrons are delocalized within the entire molecule due to the pi-conjugation. The electronic wavefunction of the HOMO was distributed entirely over conjugated molecules , which is beneficial for obtaining higher hole mobility. From the DFT B3LYP / 6-31G* level calculations , 18 HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DPAV-PT are -5.3 and -3.24 eV and E g is 2.06 eV , which are in good agreement with the experimental values for the energy gap and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Therefore , the DFT calculations performed here on the repetitive units can provide good estimations of the HOMO , LUMO , and bandgap energy trends , thus allowing a rapid screening of the most promising polymeric structures . In order to investigate the potential applications of the copolymer in solar cells , bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / DPAV - PT : PCBM(1 : 1 w / w ) / Ca / Al.

Fig. 6 shows the current density versus voltage ( J-V ) curve of the device and the corresponding open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short circuit current ( J sc ) , fill factor ( FF ). It can be seen that the V oc , J sc and FF values of the device with DPAV-PT as electron donor are 0.68 V , 2.78 mA cm^-2 , 0.35 , respectively. PCE of the preliminary device based on DPAV-PT is 0.7% . Compared with the photovoltaic device based on OTPAV-PT , 12 the device based on DPAV-PT possessed better photovoltaic performance , which may be contributed to by the higher open circuit voltage , relatively broader and red - shifted absorption , relative higher hole mobility in the blend of DPAV-PT and PCBM . . In the OFETs , drain current ( I DS ) can be described with the following equation : I DS = m(W / 2L)C i ( V G - V T ) 2 Where C i is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer , V G is the gate voltage , V T is the threshold voltage , m is the field - effect mobility , and W and L are the channel width and length dimensions , respectively. The mobility was calculated from the slope of the curve of I DS 1 / 2 vs. V G . The threshold voltage of the device was determined from the linear fit of the square root of I DS at the saturated regime vs. gate voltage V G , and V T was determined by extrapolating the measured data to I DS = 0. Thin films of DPAV-PT exhibit relative low hole mobility without thermal annealing. The mobility of DPAV-PT films deposited on bare and OTS treated substrates were about 7.91 x 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and 1.10 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. OTS surface modification reduced the threshold voltage from -17 - -21 V to -2--6 V , and slightly improved the on / off ratio as shown in Fig. 7. Due to low HOMO of DPAV-PT ( -5.0 eV ) , the current at zero gate voltage of the OFET devices was very low , affording ideal switch on characteristics and superior stability against doping , which is dramatically better than the polymer P3HT. Fig. 8a-d show the output curves and the transfer characteristics of DPAV-PT , without and with OTS modifications after being annealed at 180 C. After annealing , OFETs of DPAV-PT fabricated on OTS treated substrate afforded a hole mobility of 6.1 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , an on / off ratio of 10^3 and a threshold voltage of -7 V , respectively.

Fig. 9a and b show the AFM images of films spin - cast with DPAV-PT on bare and OTS modified substrate , Fig. 9c and d show the AFM images of the annealed films. Both the presence of the OTS monolayer at the polymer / dielectric interface and the thermal annealing increase surface smoothness of DPAV-PT thin films. As-spun films of DPAV-PT are always more rough than those of annealed thin films , independent of substrate chemistry. The morphology of the films is in agreement with their trend of charge transport performances. The hole mobility was increased after device annealed and it was apparently correlated with the surface morphology , indicating a strong relationship between morphology and device performances . In summary , we have synthesized a new side chain conjugated polythiophene derivative , DPAV-PT , by the Stille coupling reaction. The polymer possesses good solubility in common organic solvents. DPAV-PT film exhibited broad absorption in the visible region from 300 nm to 650 nm , a relatively low HOMO level , which is beneficial for the air - stability and the increase of V oc of the PSC. A DPAV-PT based polymer solar cell afforded a PCE of 0.7% under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 , a FET device demonstrated an average hole mobility of 6.1 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 after 180 °C annealing. The preliminary results indicate that DPAV-PT could be a good candidate for applications in polymer solar cell and organic field effect transistors .",

In addition , the pyridine group can not only build interfacial dipoles at the CIL / cathode interfaces , leading to reduced cathode work functions and improved open - circuit voltages , but also n-dope the fullerene acceptors , which decreases interfacial energy loss at the cathode side.

Therefore , these pyridine - functionalized polymers are promising candidates as CILs for high - performance PSCs . In recent years , bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have become a significantly promising candidate technology for light - to - electricity conversion , as a result of their mechanical flexibility , light weight and potential for large - area and low - cost fabrication by low - temperature solution processing methodologies. 1,2 Typically , the basic device architecture of a BHJ PSC adopts a \" sandwich structure \" comprised of a light - harvesting blend active layer sandwiched between the hole - collecting anode and electron - collecting cathode.

Water / alcohol - soluble conjugated polymers ( WSCPs ) , composed of conjugated backbones and polar functional groups , have been successfully demonstrated to work as effective CILs for BHJ PSCs. 26 Their conjugated backbones afford them good optoelectronic properties and the polar functional groups endow them with versatile water / alcohol solubility. 27,28 Their unique solubility in high polar solvents allow for the fabrication of multilayer devices by solution processing methods without interface erosion , since the adjacent active layers are usually only soluble in low polar solvents. Furthermore , the interfacial dipole effects induced by the interactions between polar functional groups and metal cathodes may lower the cathode WFs , and thus enlarge the V bi across the devices and increase the V oc of PSCs. 15,27 In addition , previous studies indicated that the lone - pair electrons or anions existing in the polar functional groups may n-dope fullerene derivative acceptors at the active layer / CIL interfaces , subsequently increasing the electron mobility of blended active layers and reducing the interfacial energy loss. 27,29,30 Among the reported WSCPs , polyfluorene ( PF ) derivatives have attracted the most attention because of their merits in facile synthesis , good film - forming abilities and large band gaps ( E g ). 15,31 Various polar pendant groups ( e.g. , amino , 32 quaternary ammonium , 33 phosphate , 26 carboxyl 34 and zwitterionic 17,35 groups ) can be feasibly introduced into PFs through facile alkylation and side chain modification in fluorene moieties. Interestingly , PFs , as versatile CILs , have greatly promoted PSC performance.

Note that the absorption and PL peaks of PFPy-P in film form are also blue - shifted relative to the other three polymers , due to the smaller conjugation length of phenyl compared to the fluorene unit , which can increase the optical band gap ( E g opt ) of PFPy-P. The E g opt values of these polymers were estimated from the absorption onset in film , with values of 2.88 , 2.87 , 2.90 and 2.97 eV for PFPy , PFPy-FO , PFPy - FEO and PFPy-P , respectively . The electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated using cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) , as shown in Figure 3 To investigate the cathode modification abilities of these polymers , poly[N-9''-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiadiazole)] ( PCDTBT ) : [6,6] are presented in Figure 4b , and the corresponding photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table 2. The reference PSCs without any CIL display a maximal PCE of 5.38% , with V oc , J sc and FF values of 0.88 V , 10.70 mA cm^-2 and 57.1% , respectively , which are consistent with the previous reports. 47,48 The MeOH / AcOH treatment slightly elevates the PCE to 5.50% .",

These results To investigate the working mechanisms of the resulting polymeric CILs , the J-V characteristics of the PSCs in the dark were also measured , as shown in Figure 5a. It can be observed that under reverse bias and low forward bias , all the dark currents of the polymer - modified devices are lower than those of the bare Al and solvent - treated devices. As J in this region depends mainly on the thickness and quality of the active layer , the decreased reverse and leakage currents may result from the fact that these polymeric CILs This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx J. Name. , 2013 , 00 , 1-3 | 6 Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins act as protective layers to prevent Al from diffusing into the active layers. 49 Among these four polymers , PFPy-P shows the lowest leakage current , which may results in the highest photovoltaic performance for PSCs. Moreover , a previous study reported that the depressed reverse dark current contributed to the V oc enhancement when using WSCPs as CILs in PSCs. 50 Hence , the improvements in V oc after introducing these polymeric CILs may result from the reduction in reverse dark current. In the range of 0-2 V , the turn-on voltages for the bare Al , solvent - treated , PFPy- , PFPy-FO- , PFPy - FEOand PFPy-P - modified devices are ~ 0.91 , 1.02 , 1.18 , 1.17 , 1.15 and 1.12 V , respectively. These results mean that the V bi values across the PSCs are enhanced when these polymers are introduced as CILs , which is possibly the main reason for the improvements in V oc . Furthermore , the reason for the V bi enhancements may be ascribed to the reduction of cathode WFs induced by the interfacial dipoles formed at the CIL / cathode interfaces , as discussed later. Finally , under high forward bias , the injection currents of these polymer - modified devices are higher than those of the bare Al and solvent - washed devices , suggesting that electron injections from the cathodes to active layers are improved after inserting these CILs. 49 It is well known that amine - functionalized CILs can n-dope PC71BM via the lone - pair electron - induced charge transfer process , which generated more efficiently conductive pathways to improve electron transport and extraction in PSCs.",

The deposition conditions for these polymer films are the same as those for the PSC fabrication. It can be observed that all the ITO / CIL substrates display transparencies over 80% from 340 to 700 nm , and the transmittances reach 90% -100% over 420 nm. The high transparencies of these polymer CILs will not reduce the photon harvesting of active layers obviously , which are beneficial for realizing higher J sc values. It is well known that amino groups in CILs can induce interfacial dipoles at the active layer / cathode interfaces. These interfacial dipoles can decrease the WFs of electrodes and thus enlarge the V bi of devices , which is the main reason for V oc improvements in PSCs. 27,35 In order to verify whether pyridine group could form dipole interaction with cathode , we measured the WFs of ITO subjected to different treatments by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy , as shown in Figure 10a.

However , when ITO is covered with one of the resulting polymers , its WF reduces to 4.36 , 4.48 , 4.54 and 4.59 eV for PFPy , PFPy-FO , PFPy - FEO and PFPy-P , respectively. These results mean that interfacial dipoles may be built at the polymer / ITO interfaces ( Figure 10b ) , which lead to the enhancements in V bi , V oc and FF. Moreover , the interfacial dipoles may also exist between the polymer / Al interfaces , resulting in the improvements in V bi and V oc of the conventional PSCs discussed above. The reduced WFs of ITO can build better energy alignments and Ohmic contacts with the active layer ( Figure 10c ) , which promote electron transport and extraction at the cathode side , thus increasing the J sc . 57 In summary , a series of novel alcohol - soluble conjugated polymers with pyridine groups in the side chains of fluorene scaffolds are developed and used as CILs in high - performance conventional and inverted PSCs. Similar to amino groups , the pyridine group can build interfacial dipoles at the CIL / cathode interfaces , which can efficiently reduce the WFs of cathodes and thus increase the V oc of Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins PSCs. Moreover , the pyridine group can n-dope fullerene acceptors via lone - pair electron - induced charge transfer process , leading to improved electron transport for active layers. As a result , these newly developed WSCPs can significantly improve the performance of both conventional and inverted PSCs.",

High molecular weight polymers P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c , which are fully soluble in 1,2-dichorobenzene ( DCB ) at elevated temperature , have been prepared by Suzuki polycondensation. Among these polymers , P-1c exhibited the highest hole mobility up to 1.36 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . PSCs based P-1b:PC71BM demonstrated the highest V oc up to 0.98 V. P-1a:PC71BM based PSCs gave the highest power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.41% , which is the highest value among solar cells with benzothiadiazole-and silafluorene - containing polymers as the donor material . In recent years , the research on polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) has experienced a rapid development since a large number of new donor - acceptor ( D-A ) alternating conjugated polymers have been synthesized and used as donor component of the active layer. 1-8 Donor - acceptor design is a very appealing design style ; one can easily tune the absorption and energy level of polymers by changing the donor or / and acceptor unit. 9,10 Benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( BT ) is a commonly used strong acceptor unit , as shown in Chart 1 , including the parent BT five kinds of derivatives , namely , BT , 11-16 5-alkoxybenzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( ABT ) , 17 5,6-di(alkoxy)benzo[c] [1,2,5]-thiadiazole ( DABT ) , 1^8 , 1^9 5-fl uo ro be nz o[ c ] [1,2,5]-thiadiazole ( FBT ) , 17,20-23 and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( DFBT ) 24-27 have been used for the synthesis of donor- acceptor ( D-A ) alternating conjugated polymers for PSCs.

    "sentence": "Herein , we focus on the design and synthesis of novel silafluorene ( SiF ) and BT based soluble conjugated polymers for high efficiency PSCs. As shown in Chart 2 , the first SiF and BT based conjugated polymer PBSDTBT with a number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of 15 kDa was prepared by Leclerc et al. and a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 1.6% was achieved. 31 Later , Cao et al. reported the PCE of high molecular weight PSiF - DBT based PSCs could reach 5.4% . 32 We previously reported the synthesis of SiF and 5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole based conjugated polymer P2 , and P2 based PSCs gave a PCE of 6.05% . 33 You et al. have recently shown that the introduction of fluorine atom onto the polymer backbone can lower the HOMO level of polymers to acquire high V oc and suppress the charge recombination to enhance short circuit current ( J sc ) and fill factor ( FF ). 20,23 At the beginning of this research , we first designed and synthesized DFBT and SiF based polymer PSiF - DTDFBT , whose structure is shown in Chart 2. However , PSiF - DTDFBT is unfortunately insoluble in any organic solvent even at elevated temperature. As we known , conjugated polymers are of rod - liked structures , in order to endow them with good solubility , flexible side chains are required to act as the inherent solvent. 34-36 To achieve soluble polymers , we for the first time designed and synthesized 5-alkoxy-6-fluorobenzo-[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole ( AFBT ) and SiF based conjugated polymer PSiF - DTAFBT. Because of the intramolecular S-O supramolecular interaction , the replacement of one fluorine atom on DFBT unit with alkoxy substituent can markedly enhance the solubility of polymers without interfering the close packing of polymer chains in the solid state. 18,28,37 To study the influence of side chains on the performance of PSCs , we have synthesized three polymers with different alkoxy substituent on the BT unit. These polymers are of high molecular weight and fully soluble in organic solvents such as chlorobenzene ( CB ) and dichlorobenzene ( DCB ). Pure polymer films exhibited field effect transistor ( FET ) hole mobilities ranging from 1.51 × 10^-3 to 1.36 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which match the electron mobility of PC71BM. Bulk heterojunction PSCs based on these polymers and PC71BM exhibited high V oc up to 0.98 V. A high PCE up to 6.41% has been obtained. To the best of our knowledge , a PCE of 6.41% is the best result for PSCs based on silafluorene and benzothiadiazole containing polymers , indicating these polymers are promising donor materials for high efficiency PSCs. Starting from commercially available 4,5-difluorobenzene-1,2diamine ( 1 ) , 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole ( 4 ) was synthesized according to the literature procedures.",

Suzuki polycondensations of M-1a , M-1b , and M-1c with 9,9-dioctyl-9H-silafluorene-2,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester ) were carried out with Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as the catalyst precursor and tetrabutylammonium bromide as the phase transfer catalyst in a solvent mixture of aqueous NaHCO 3 and toluene to afford polymers P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c , respectively , in yields of 82-90 % . Since the introduction a flexible alkoxy chain on the benzothiadiazole ring , all the as-synthesized polymers are fully soluble in CB , DCB , and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene ( TCB ) at elevated temperature. Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions , which were measured by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) at 150 °C with TCB as an eluent and narrowly distributed polystyrenes as the calibration standards , are summarized in Table 1. P-1a with an octyloxy chain on the benzothiadiazole unit showed a M n of 34.8 kg / mol and a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 2.31. Of the three polymers , P-1b and P-1c with branched alkoxy chain on benzothiadiazole unit were better soluble in hot toluene , which was the organic solvent used for Suzuki polycondensation , allowing us to achieve high molecular weight polymers. P-1b showed a M n of 97.8 kg / mol and a PDI of 3.68 , and P-1c showed a M n of 114.9 kg / mol and a PDI of 2.15. Thermo gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) were used to investigate the thermal properties of these polymers. Under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C / Min , all the three polymers exhibited good thermal stability with the 5% decomposition temperature up to 357 °C for P-1a , 338 °C for P-1b , and 338 °C for P-1c. DSC measurements under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C / Min in the range of 20 to 300 °C also showed that there was no obvious glass transition for all the three polymers. Powdery XRD measurement ( Figure 1 ) was used to investigate the packing of polymer chains in the solid state. All these polymers showed one diffraction peak at small angle region and one broad diffraction peak at wide angle region.",

The broad diffraction peaks at the wide angle region are located at 2θ of 22.45 , 22.11 , and 20.51 ° for P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c , respectively , corresponding to π-π stacking distances of 3.96 , 4.01 , and 4.31 Å. Optical Properties. UV - vis absorption spectra of polymers P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c in DCB solutions at 100 °C and as thin films are shown in Figure 2. To eliminate the influence of polymer chain aggregation in solution at room temperature , the UV - vis absorption spectra of polymer solutions were therefore measured at 100 ° C. Both in solutions and as thin films , all the three polymers exhibited two absorption peaks , and their locations are summarized in Table 2. Compared with their solution absorption spectra , the corresponding film ones were red - shifted due to the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. The film absorption onsets ( λ edge ) of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c were 624 , 621 , and 618 nm , respective. The increasing of the volume of substituent group on the benzothiadiazole moiety could increase the π-π stacking distance of polymer chains in films and resulted in a blue - shift of the absorption peak. The optical band gaps ( E g,opt ) of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c films were therefore calculated to be 1.99 , 1.99 , and 2.00 eV , respectively , according to the equation : E g,opt = 1240 / absorption onset. Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical properties of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) using a standard three electrodes electrochemical cell. As shown in Figure 3 , these three polymers exhibited quasi reversible redox processes. The onset oxidation potentials of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c are 0.83 , 0.85 , and 0.88 V , respectively. HOMO levels of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c were determined , using the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71 ) , to be -5.54 , -5.56 , and -5.59 eV , respectively. LUMO levels of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c were therefore calculated according to the equation E LUMO = E HOMO + E g,opt to be -3.55 , -3.57 , and -3.59 eV , respectively. The data are also summarized in Table 2. The above results indicated that the introduction of big volume alkoxy chain on the mono fluoro benzothiadiazole unit can only slightly lower the HOMO energy level of polymers. Their low - lying HOMO level is favorable for achieving PSCs with higher V oc .",

Hole mobilities of P-1a , P-1b , and P-1c were calculated to be 1.51 × 10^-3 , 8.0 × 10^-3 , and 1.36 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , which are close to the electron mobility of PC71BM ( 2 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). 28 The hole mobilities , V T and the on / off ratio are summarized in Table 3. The hole mobility of polymer films is usually related to two main factors , namely , the π-π stacking distance and molecular weight of polymers. Usually shorter π-π stacking distance and higher molecular weight are prone to endow polymer films with higher hole mobility. 39 The π-π stacking distance of P1-a is shorter than that of P1-c , but the molecular weight of P1-a is much smaller than that of P1-c. Therefore , it is reasonable that the mobility of P1-c is larger that of P-1a. Photovoltaic Properties. Photovoltaic properties were investigated in a device configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / interfacial layer / Al. The thickness of active layer was about 100 nm. Two different interfacial layers , LiF and FN - C60 , were tested. As shown in Chart 3 , FN - C60 is an alcoholsoluble cationic fullerene derivative , which can be spin - coated atop the active layer without damaging the underlayer. We have screened the weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM , the concentration of blend solutions , the spin - coating speed , and the volume of 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) additive to achieve the better device performance. The preliminary results are summarized in Table 4. For all the three polymers , a polymer to PC71BM weight ratio of 1 : 3 gave the best photovoltaic performances. For P-1a , devices fabricated from DCB solutions using LiF as the interfacial layer for cathode gave a PCE of 4.56% with a V oc of 0.91 V , a J sc of 9.46 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.53. When DIO ( 2.0% , by volume ) was used as the processing additive , the PCE was slightly enhanced to 5.80% . The increasing of PCE was mainly attributed to the increasing of J sc and FF. When FN - C60 was used as the interfacial layer instead of LiF , the PCE was further increased to 6.41% , accompanied by the simultaneously increasing of the V oc , J sc , and FF. It is believed that the use of FN - C60 as the interfacial layer for cathode can enhance the interfacial contact , electron transportation , and collection.",

    "sentence": "For P-1b , PSC devices with active layers spin - coated from DCB solutions containing DIO ( 2.0% , by volume ) also gave better photovoltaic performance than that fabricated from DCB solutions. The best device performance with a PCE of 4.85% , a V oc of 0.98 V , a J sc of 8.5 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.59 was achieved when FN - C60 was used instead of LiF as the interfacial layer for cathode. For P-1c , devices fabricated from DCB solutions containing DIO ( 2.0% , by volume ) also gave the best device performance with a PCE of 5.06% , a V oc of 0.96 V , a J sc of 8.54 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.62. The trend of J sc for the devices is P-1a > P-1c > P-1b , which is inconsistent with the trend of hole mobility of the FET devices based on these polymers. The inconsistency is probably due to that the FET mobility is measured for the pure polymer films in FET devices. Namely , the FET mobility reflects the transport property along the thin polymer film. The short circuit current ( J sc ) of solar cells is related to the transport property of polymer : PC71BM blend instead of pure polymer films. The J sc is mainly related to the nanostructures of polymer : PC71BM blend films. The above preliminary device results indicated that the substituent on the benzothiadiazole unit had significant influence on the performance of PSCs. Devices based on the monooctyloxy-and monofluoro substituted benzothiadiazole containing conjugated polymer P-1a gave the best device performance , even where the molecular weight of P-1a was the lowest one among the three polymers. Further increasing the photovoltaic performance was anticipated after intensive device optimization. J-V curves for the solar cells are found in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 6 , external quantum efficiencies ( EQE ) were measured to examine the accuracy of J sc of devices fabricated under the optimized conditions for each polymer. All polymers exhibited broad photo to current responses in the range of 350 to 700 nm. In the range of 400 to 600 nm , the EQE value of P-1a is higher than 60% with the maximum close to 70% . For P-1b and P-1c , these two polymers exhibited similar EQE curves , in the range of 400 to 600 nm EQE values are around 50% . For all the three polymers , the J sc calculated from the integration of EQE curves matched well with that obtained from J-V measurements. This good agreement could confirm the accuracy of PCE obtained from J-V measurements. Film Morphology. DIO is a higher boiling point solvent than the processing solvent DCB , exhibits better solubility for PC71BM , and can be used as additive to affect the morphology of polymer : PC71BM blend films. 18,40 In previous studies , it has been shown that polymer component can form connected fibrous network when using DIO as the processing additive.",

I exhibits onset decomposition temperature ( T d ) of 410 °C and glass - transition temperature ( T g ) of 180 °C , higher than those of IIb ( Td , 330 °C ; T g , 130 °C ).

Porphyrin derivatives exhibit large third - order nonlinear optical response , strong two - photon absorption , and potential application in photodynamic therapy. 2 Moreover , applications of porphyrin molecules and polymers in organic electronic devices such as light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) , and solar cells have been reported. Recently , we reported a series of star - shaped oligomers and polymers and hyperbranched polymers based on porphyrin as efficient red light - emitting materials. 3 OFET devices made using porphyrin small molecules exhibit carrier mobilities up to 0.2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . 4 However , there have been few reports in which porphyrin polymers were used in OFETs as active layers. The device performance based on the porphyrin polymers is quite poor. For example , OFETs made using a porphyrin-diacetylene polymer give mobilities of 1 × 10^-7 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 at room temperature and 2 × 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 at 175 ° C. 5 Organic solar cells using porphyrin - containing small molecules , oligomers , and polymers as active layers give low power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ).",

    "sentence": "6 For example , the efficiency of the device based on porphyrin triad , porphyrin - containing oligomers , mainchain porphyrin polymers , and porphyrin - grafted poly(phenylene vinylene ) is 0.035% , 6a 0.0081% , 6b 1-10 ppm , 6c and 0.33% , 6d respectively. The main reason for the low PCEs is limited light absorption of porphyrin. The absorption spectra of porphyrin unit exhibit narrow and strong Soret band ( 410-430 nm ) , weak Q-bands ( 530-540 nm ) , and blank between the Soret and Q bands. Current trends in device fabrication favor solution - processing. In general , polymers are more suitable for solution processing than small molecules to obtain good - quality thin films. Some side - chain 7 and nonconjugated main - chain porphyrin polymers 8 have been reported. Their electronic and optical properties have not changed much in comparison with that of porphyrin small molecules because there is no direct π-conjugation between neighboring units. In order to improve the properties of the porphyrin polymers , main - chain conjugated porphyrin polymers have been synthesized. 9 However , if the porphyrin units are directly connected , steric hindrance between them disturbs formation of an extended conjugation. Some efforts have been devoted to synthesis of porphyrin polymers with improved solubility and conjugation. Main - chain conjugated porphyrin polymers with various spacers including arylene , aryleneethynylene and phenylenevinylene between porphyrins have been synthesized , but very few electronic device results have been reported. 10 The planarity and S ° ° ° S interaction of fused thiophenes have been found to promote highly ordered π-stacked structures and high hole mobilities. Several groups have reported synthesis of fused thiophene derivatives and applications in OFETs. 11 Recently , we fabricated high - performance OFET devices using the fused thiophene molecules which we synthesized. 12 In this paper , we present the synthesis of soluble main - chain π-conjugated porphyrin-dithienothiophene copolymers ( Figure 1 ). Introduction of dithienothiophene ( DTT ) and diethynyldithienothiophene into the porphyrin polymer main chain can reduce steric hindrance , extend conjugation , enhance absorption , and improve charge transport property. 3,4,5-Tris(dodecyloxy)phenyl groups at positions 10 and 20 of the zinc porphyrin ring can improve solubility , induce self - assembly , and enhance molecular ordering. In addition , the polymers were used in organic field - effect transistors and solar cells to demonstrate their potential utility . Synthesis and Characterization. The synthesis of the porphyrin monomers is shown in Scheme 1. New intermediate trans-substituted porphyrin 1 was synthesized in 60% yield by acid - catalyzed condensation of dipyrromethane with 3,4,5tridodecyloxybenzaldehyde , followed by oxidation with 2,3dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone ( DDQ ) at room temperature , similar to Lindsey 's method. 13 After bromination reaction with NBS and then coordination reaction with zinc acetate , zinc dibromoporphyrin 3 was readily obtained in high yield.",

    "sentence": "Another monomer diethynylporphyrin 5 was synthesized in high yield from zinc dibromoporphyrin 3 by Sonogashira coupling with trimethylsilylacetylene ( TMSA ) , followed by removal of the protecting groups with tetrabutylammonium fluoride ( TBAF ). All new compounds have been characterized by 1H NMR , 13 °C NMR , MS and elemental analysis. The data are consistent with the proposed structures. Scheme 2 shows the synthesis of the porphyrin polymers as well as the small molecule reference. The reference compound 0 was synthesized in high yield by coordination reaction of porphyrin1withzincacetate.Thesingle-bondlinkedporphyrin-DTT copolymer ( I ) was synthesized by Stille coupling reaction between dibromoporphyrin 3 and DTT ditin. Two different strategies were employed to synthesize triple - bond linked porphyrin - DTT polymer ( IIa and IIb ). As shown in Scheme 2 , different monomers were employed for the polycondensation based on Sonogashira coupling reaction. The monomers are zinc dibromoporpyrin 3 and diethynyl dithienothiophene in route a , while they are zinc diethynylporphyrin 5 and dibromodithienothiophene in route b. Polymers IIa and IIb are obtained through these two routes , respectively. All these polymers have good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , THF , and toluene. All the polymers can be readily processed to form smooth and pinhole - free films upon spin - coating. The 3,4,5-tris(dodecyloxy)phenyl groups at Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using polystyrene standards as calibrants ( Table 1 ). Polymer I has a M n of 46^500 , corresponding to a degree of polymerization of ca. 25. Polymers IIa and IIb show M n values of 12^700 and 15^300 , corresponding to degrees of polymerization of ca. 7 and 8 , respectively. The single - bond linked porphyrin - DTT copolymer I has a much higher M n value than the triple - bond linked porphyrin - DTT polymers IIa and IIb ; IIb has a higher M n than IIa. This is probably related to a side reaction involving the ethynyl groups. Under the same reaction conditions of Sonogashira coupling , oxidative coupling of ethynyl groups usually occurs as a side reaction to give a butadiyne. 14 Diethynylporphyrin undergoes oxidative coupling with more difficulty than diethynyldithienothiophene due to the increased steric hindrance between larger porphyrin units. This butadiyne byproduct will reduce the amount of the ethynyl group to react with bromo segments. Furthermore , the butadiyne byproduct of diethynyldithienothiophene has a low solubility and prevents the polymer chain growth in reaction system. In comparison with IIa , IIb exhibits higher molecular weight , better elemental analysis , and red - shifted absorption , suggesting that the second route is more preferable. A similar phenomenon was found by Krebs et al. in synthesis of zinc porphyrin linked poly(phenyleneethynylene ). 15 The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) under nitrogen.",

    "sentence": "Polymers I and IIb have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures of 410 and 330 °C , respectively ( Figure 2 ). Figure 3 shows DSC traces of polymers I and IIb. While the polymer samples were heated , glass transitions were observed at 180 ( I ) and 130 °C ( IIb ) , but no melting point , suggesting that the polymers are amorphous. The higher decomposition temperature and higher glass - transition temperature of I are probably related to its higher molecular weight. Absorption and Fluorescence Spectra. Figure 4 shows the UV - vis absorption spectra of the porphyrin polymers as well as the porphyrin small molecule in solution. The small molecule reference shows a sharp Soret band at 412 nm and a Q-band at 538 nm , which is a typical absorption profile for porphyrin compounds. All the polymers show absorptions in the regions of Soret band and Q-band. Compared to the reference absorption , the Soret band and Q-band of the polymers are broadened. In comparison with that for the small molecule reference 0 , the absorption spectrum of the single - bond linked porphyrin - DTT polymer I exhibits a red shift of ca. 24 nm , caused by the larger conjugation of the polymer. The Soret band and Q-band of the triple - bond linked porphyrin - DTT polymer IIa further red shift ca. 28 and 94 nm , respectively ; the Q-bands are broadened and stronger , compared to that for the single - bond linked counterpart I. A similar phenomenon was observed in porphyrin-thiophene polymers. 10a In polymer I , steric hindrance between directly linked porphyrin and DTT units leads to twisted main chain and limited conjugation ; while in polymer IIa , the triple - bond linker between porphyrin and DTT units reduces the steric hindrance and , therefore , promotes coplanarity and extended π-conjugation. Interestingly , the Soret band and Q-band of the triple - bond linked porphyrin - DTT polymer IIb , synthesized by route b , exhibit red shift of 10 and 47 nm respectively , compared to IIa , synthesized by route a. This result is consistent with the GPC measurements which show that IIb possesses a higher molecular weight than IIa does. The UV - vis spectra of polymer I and IIb in thin film are shown in Figure 5. The absorption spectrum of polymer I in thin film is similar to that in solution , which is probably related to the twisted main chain. However , the Soret band and Q-band of IIb are broadened and red shift 18 and 57 nm respectively , compared to that in solution. It is worth noting that the Q-band of IIb in thin film is located at 650-850 nm and is much stronger than that in solution. This is beneficial to sunlight harvesting because the solar emission spectrum is peaked at 600-800 nm.",

The output curve shows good saturation behavior with clear saturation currents. Table 2 summarizes the performance of OFETs based on I and IIb before and after annealing. Interestingly , the device performance of the two polymers shows different trends with thermal annealing. The OFET based on I exhibits a mobility of 5.0 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with current on / off ratio of 4 × 10^4 at room temperature ; the thermal annealing at 175 °C leads to improved performance with a mobility of 2.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and current on / off ratio of 2 × 10^5 . The OFET based on IIb exhibits a mobility of 1.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with current on / off ratio of 2 × 10^3 and a low threshold voltage of ca. -3.3 V at room temperature ; the thermal annealing at 80 °C leads to decreased performance with a mobility of 5.4 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and current on / off ratio of 1 × 10^3 . IIb shows higher mobility than I at room temperature , probably because it has more coplanar and extended π-conjugated main chain and stronger aggregation and intermolecular interaction in thin film , as suggested by UV data of thin films. To understand the effect of thermal annealing on the device performance , we employed X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to gain insight into the thin film morphology. The XRD patterns for thin films of I and IIb before and after annealing ( see Supporting Information Figure S1 ) show only very broad peaks , typical for amorphous materials. This result is consistent with high T g s of the polymers ( Figure 3 ). From AFM images ( Figure S2 in Supporting Information ) , no crystalline domains were observed for all the thin films , consistent with the XRD and DSC results. However , the thermal annealing does exert somewhat impact on the thin film morphology. Some defects were observed from the film of I at room temperature , while the film becomes more uniform and smooth with lower defect density after annealing at 175 ° C. The film of IIb before annealing is more uniform and smooth than that after annealing at 80 ° C. The FET device performance is strongly related to the film morphology and quality ; the charge transport is influenced by the defect density which could trap a large amount of charge carriers. Thus , thermal annealing leads to different film quality and therefore , different device performance. Photovoltaic Cells.",

To investigate the potential of these porphyrin-dithienothiophene copolymers for photovoltaic applications , we used I or IIb as an electron donor and PCBM as an electron acceptor , and fabricated bulk heterojunction PSCs with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / blend / Al. Both estimated LUMO and HOMO levels of the donor I or IIb are more than 0.5 eV higher than that of the acceptor PCBM , indicating that the energy level positions of the donor and acceptor are suitable for efficient charge transfer and separation at the interface between the donor and acceptor. 17 Photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching in donor / acceptor composites is a symptom of efficient photoinduced charge transfer between the donor and acceptor. 18 To get insight into the possible photoinduced electron transfer from the polymers to PCBM , PL spectroscopy of the polymers in the presence of PCBM was carried out. PL of the blend of I / PCBM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) and IIb / PCBM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) was hardly observed upon excitation at Soret or Q-band maxima of the polymers , similar to that of neat I and IIb. Thus , PL spectra of the blend can not give clear evidence for photoinduced electron transfer from the polymers to PCBM. The PSCs were fabricated using the blends with different weight ratios of I or IIb to PCBM. The current density ( J ) versus voltage ( V ) curve of the PSC with the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / IIb : PCBM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) / Al under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 at 100 mW / cm^2 is shown in Figure 9 as an example. The open circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short circuit current density ( J sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the devices are summarized in Table 3. When IIb : PCBM weight ratio is 1 : 3 , the PSC device exhibited the best performance ; V oc , J sc , FF and PCE reached 0.58 V , 1.52 mA / cm^2 , 0.34 and 0.3% , respectively. The PCE of 0.3% is among the highest for the PSCs based on porphyrin - containing molecules and polymers. 6 Optimization of the device structures and thermal annealing can be expected to substantially increase the PCE of the PSCs. The PCE of 0.3% achieved for the PSC using IIb : PCBM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) as active layer is double that using I : PCBM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) as active layer , consistent with IIb 's exhibiting stronger absorption at Q-band and higher mobility at room temperature .",

In comparison with the single - bond linked polymer I , the triple - bond linked polymers IIa and IIb exhibit red - shifted absorption and emission spectra , especially significantly red - shifted and much stronger Q-band absorption , since IIa and IIb have coplanar and extended π-conjugated main chain related to the triple bond spacer. The triple - bond linked polymer IIb is electrochemically active in both the oxidation and reduction regions , while the single - bond linked polymer I shows only an oxidation peak. The field - effect hole mobilities up to 2.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 were obtained for these porphyrin-dithienothiophene copolymers. IIb shows higher mobility than I at room temperature , probably because it has more coplanar and extended π-conjugated main chain and stronger aggregation and intermolecular interaction in thin film. The device performance of the two polymers shows different trends with thermal annealing ; thermal annealing leads to different film quality and therefore , different device performance. The PCE of 0.3% was achieved for the PSC using IIb : PCBM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) as active layer , among the highest reported for the PSCs based on porphyrin - containing molecules and polymers. The PCE of the PSC based on IIb : PCBM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) is double that based on I : PCBM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) , consistent with that IIb exhibits stronger Q-band absorption and higher mobility at room temperature .",

    "sentence": "A series of conjugated donor (D)-π-acceptor ( A ) copolymers , P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) , and P(BDT-TT-BT) , based on benzodithiophene ( BDT ) donor unit and benzothiadiazole ( BT ) acceptor unit with different π-bridges , were designed and synthesized via a Pd - catalyzed Stille - coupling method. The πbridges between the BDT donor unit and BT acceptor unit are furan ( F ) in P(BDT-F-BT) , thiophene ( T ) in P(BDT-T-BT) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ( TT ) in P(BDT-TT-BT ). It was found that the π-bridges significantly affect the molecular architecture and optoelectronic properties of the copolymers. With the π-bridge varied from furan to thiophene , then to thieno[3,2-b]thiophene , the shape of the molecular chains changed from z-shaped to almost straight line gradually. Band gaps of P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) and P(BDT-TT-BT) were tuned from 1.96 to 1.82 to 1.78 eV with HOMO levels up - shifted from -5.44 to -5.35 to -5.21 eV , respectively. Bulk heterojunction solar cells with the polymers as donor and PC71BM as acceptor demonstrated power conversion efficiency varied from 2.81% for P(BDT-F-BT) to 3.72% for P(BDT-T-BT) and to 4.93% for P(BDT-TT-BT ). Compared to furan and thiophene , thieno[3,2-b]thiophene πbridge in the copolymers shows superior photovoltaic performance. The results indicate that the photovoltaic performance of some high efficiency D-A copolymers reported in literatures could be improved further by inserting suitable π-bridges . During the past decade , bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have been the focus of both scientific research and industrial application , because of their potential applications in large area , lightweight , flexible photovoltaic devices through low - cost solution - processable techniques. Conjugated polymers with electron donor - acceptor ( D-A ) architecture are particularly attractive due to the facile tunability of their electronic structure of the main chain. Changing the nature of the D and A moieties combining with different side chains influences numerous properties such as absorption bands , energy levels , charge carrier mobilities , and morphology. 1-13 These properties affect the characteristics of PSCs and finally determine the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the devices. Many efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of new donor and acceptor building blocks , 14-27 in order to get efficient D-A copolymers for PSCs. But there are only a few studies focus on the bridges between D and A segments. 28-30 Recently , we designed and synthesized a furan - containing D-π-A copolymer. 28a We found that using furan instead of thiophene as the π-bridge in the copolymer is able to significantly affect the properties of the polymer. Conjugated bridges crucially influence the electronic structure of polymer main chain and the interaction between donor and acceptor units ; therefore remarkably affect stereostructure and consequently optical , electrochemical , charge transport and photovoltaic properties of the D-π-A conjugated copolymers.",

    "sentence": "Thus , it is of prime importance to fully understand the effects of the πbridges on the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties in the design of new polymers for efficient PSCs. In this study , we designed and synthesized a series of D-π-A copolymers based on benzodithiophene ( BDT ) donor unit and benzodiathiazole ( BT ) acceptor unit bridged by different heteroaromatic rings , as shown in Figure 1. Bisalkoxysubstituted BDT and bis(octyloxy) - substituted BT were selected as donor and acceptor building blocks because they can endow polymers with broad absorption and suitable molecular energy levels 28a,31-33 to ensure sunlight harvesting and charge separation and transportation in the polymers. The properties of the polymers changed regularly from P(BDT-F-BT) to P(BDT-T-BT) and P(BDT-TT-BT) , corresponding to the π-bridge of furan , thiophene and thieno [3,2-b]thiophene. With the π-bridge units varied from furan to thiophene , then to thieno [3,2-b]thiophene , the shape of the molecular chains changed from z-shaped to almost straight line gradually. In this case , the π-orbital overlap between neighboring aromatic units was increased in turn , leading to regular changes in the frontier orbital energy levels. The absorption peak wavelengths redshifted from 534 to 568 to 631 nm ; the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy levels increased from -5.44 to -5.35 to -5.21 eV and band gaps decreased from 1.96 to 1.82 to 1.78 eV , for P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) , and P(BDT-TT-BT) , respectively. The photovoltaic power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of solar cells based on the polymers as donor and [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor varied from 2.81% for P(BDT-F-BT) to 3.72% for P(BDT-T-BT) to 4.93% for P(BDT-TT-BT) , depending on the π-bridge in the polymer backbones. 31 and 2-octyl-1-dodecyl bromide 35 were synthesized according to the literatures. Tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) was dried over Na / benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. Other reagents and solvents were commercial grade and used as received without further purification. All reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere. Molecular weights of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) method on Waters 515-2410 with polystyrenes as reference standard and tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) as an eluent. All new compounds were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra ( NMR ) recorded on a Bruker AV 600 spectrometer in CDCl3at room temperature.

Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry has been employed and considered as an effective tool in investigating electrochemical properties of conjugated oligomers and polymers. 37 From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammogram , energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels can be readily estimated , which correspond to ionization potential ( IP ) and electron affinity ( EA ) , respectively. 26,38 Cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films are shown in Figure 4. From the value of E ox and E red of the polymers , the HOMO and the LUMO as well as the electrochemical bandgaps ( E g ec ) were calculated and also listed in Table 1. The LUMO energy levels of P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) and P(BDT-TT-BT) are very close. This phenomenon indicates that different πbridges do not significantly affect the LUMO levels of the D-π-A polymers. The LUMO energy levels of the polymers are all located within a suitable range ( from -3.44 to -3.54 eV , Table 1 ) and are significantly higher - lying than that of PC71BM ( ca. -3.91 eV ) ; 40 thus , efficient charge transfer ( excitons dissociation ) could be expected to occur in their corresponding devices. 1,2,5 From the comparison with P(BDT-F-BT) , it was noticed that the π-bridges of thiophene and thieno [3,2b]thiophene lowered band gap of P(BDT-T-BT) and P(BDT-TT-BT) by increasing the HOMO energy level of the polymer from -5.44 eV ( P(BDT-F-BT) ) to -5.35 eV ( P(BDT-T-BT) ) , and to -5.21 eV ( P(BDT-TT-BT) ). The electrochemical band gaps of the polymers are well matched with their optical band gaps within the experimental error. Theoretical Calculations. To evaluate the impact of the different π-bridges on molecular architecture and consequently on the optoelectronic properties of the copolymers , density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations were performed to verify stationary points as stable states for the optimized conformations and single point energies , with a molecular main chain length n = 1 , at B3LYP / 6-311++G(3df , 3pd ) level of theory in vacuum using the Gaussian 03 program package. 41 The final energies were calculated as the sum of single point and zero point energies. In particular , the HOMO and LUMO level positions and related electron distributions were calculated. Moreover , all the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups in the calculation to avoid excessive computation demand . Optimized geometries of the three copolymers in ground state are shown in Figure 5. Calculated dihedral angles , bond angle and corresponding HOMO , LUMO levels and bandgaps ( E g cal ) are summarized in Table 2.",

Different π-bridge units significantly affect the molecular architecture , as shown in Figure 5 and Table 2. The dihedral angles between the acceptor unit and π-bridge and between πbridge and donor unit are all less than 10 o in all the three polymers , indicating planar conformation of the copolymer chains. Interestingly , θ 1 and θ 2 is alternating negative and positive in furan bridged polymer , while always positive in thiophene bridged polymer and negative in thieno [3,2b]thiophene bridged polymer. In other words , taking benzothiadiazole unit as reference plane , furan and BDT unit by turns deflected counterclockwise and clockwise in P(BDT-F-BT) ; while thiophene and BDT unit deflected clockwise in turn in PBTBDT and thieno [3,2-b]thiophene and BDT unit deflected counterclockwise in turn in P(BDT-TT-BT ). With the π-bridge varied from furan to thiophene , then to thieno [3,2b]thiophene , the shape of the molecular chains changed from zshaped to almost straight line with increasing of θ 3 from 127.50 ° in P(BDT-F-BT) to 151.61 o in P(BDT-T-BT) , then to 181.52 o in P(BDT-TT-BT ). In this cases , the π-orbital overlap between neighboring aromatic units are increased , leading to changes in the frontier orbital energy levels and , more specifically , to decrease in band - gaps of thiophene and thieno [3,2-b]thiophene bridged polymers in turn. Note that due to the small number of aromatic cycles taken into account by the calculation , the absolute energy values are not reliable. Only relative changes of the HOMO and LUMO values with respect to the reference molecules are meaningful. The wave functions of the frontier molecular orbital are depicted in Figure 6. As can be observed , the HOMO is delocalized along the whole π-conjugated backbone while the LUMO is mostly concentrated on the benzothiadiazole - based acceptor groups. These images provide further evidence of the formation of well - defined D-π-A structure and the intramolecular charge transfer behavior of the material ( i.e. , the HOMO to LUMO transition is a donor to acceptor intramolecular charge transfer ). 42 The calculated HOMO and LUMO level positions and band gaps of the three polymers are listed in Table 2. As can be seen , although discrepancies exist between the calculation and experimental results , the trends of variation in the HOMO and energy gaps are similar. Compared with furan - bridged P(BDT-F-BT) , it was noticed that the πbridge of thiophene and thieno [3,2-b]thiophene increased the HOMO energy level of the relative polymer P(BDT-T-BT) and P(BDT-TT-BT) , and as a result , lowered band gaps of the two polymers.

To further study the performance of the PSCs devices , the hole mobilities in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method using devices with structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au. For unipolar transport in a trap - free semiconductor with an ohmic injecting contact , the SCLC can be approximated by the Mott - Gurney equation : 43 ≅ ε ε μ γ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ J V L V L 9^8 exp 0.891 r 0^0 2^3 ( 3 ) where J is the current density , ε r is the dielectric constant of the polymer , ε 0 is the free - space permittivity ( 8.85 × 10^-12 F / m ) , μ 0 is the charge mobility at zero field , γ is a constant , L is the thickness of the blended film layer , V = V appl - V bi , V appl is the applied potential , and V bi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode ( in this device structure , V bi = 0.2 V ). Figure 9 displays ln(JL 3 / V 2 ) versus ( V / L ) 0.5 curve for the measurement of the hole mobility of the copolymers by the SCLC method.

    "sentence": "The V oc of PSCs based on P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) , and P(BDT-TT-BT) decreased from 0.94 to 0.82 to 0.69 V , which is the result of the increase of the HOMO level of the polymers. Compared to P(BDT-F-BT) and P(BDT-T-BT) , the thieno- [3,2-b]thiophene bridged polymer showed dramatically high fill factor of 0.63 , which is about one - third higher than furan and thiophene bridged polymers. The increased FF of P(BDT-TT-BT) - based PSCs could be ascribed to its higher hole mobility ( 8.6 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). The short - circuit currents of PSCs based on the polymers increased from 6.50 to 9.45 to 11.34 mA cm^-2 , which is consistent with the lowered band gaps ( from 1.96 to 1.82 to 1.78 eV ) and enhanced extinction coefficients ( from 31 to 44 to 51 cm^-1 g^-1 L ). Although the relative low open - circuit voltage , P(BDT-TT-BT) exhibited the highest PCE of 4.93% in all the three aromatic rings bridged polymers. The high photovoltaic performance of thieno [3,2-b]thiophene bridged polymer should be benefited from its high hole mobility and broad absorption. We also checked the effect of the morphology of the active layers on the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Figure 10 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) curves of the PSCs based on the polymer : PC71BM blends. These devices exhibited broad EQE responses with maximum EQE values of 40% at 472 nm , 52% at 465 nm , and 60% at 500 nm for the PSCs based on P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) , and P(BDT-TT-BT) , respectively. Compared to the absorption spectra of pristine polymers , the significantly broadened EQE responses in the visible region can be attributed to both the intrinsic absorptions of the polymers and the response of PC71BM. Compared with that of P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) - based device demonstrated much higher EQE , especially in the range of 500-600 nm , and P(BDT-TT-BT) - based device showed the highest EQE value , especially from 500 to 700 nm. The EQE results are consistent with the J sc values of the corresponding PSCs . We designed and synthesized a series of D-π-A copolymers of BDT donor unit and BT acceptor unit with furan , thiophene and thianothiaphene π-bridges , P(BDT-F-BT) , P(BDT-T-BT) , and P(BDT-TT-BT) , by Pd - catalyzed Stille - coupling reaction. These polymers possess good solubility and thermal stability. The π-bridge units significantly influence the molecular architecture and consequently impact on the optoelectronic properties of the copolymers.",

    "sentence": "A novel tetrathiafulvalene-(TTF-) fused poly(aryleneethynylene) with an acceptor main chain and donor side chains has been prepared and characterized. The EPR and UV - vis spectra show that there exists intramolecular charge transfer ( CT ) between the electron - rich TTF side chains and the electron - deficient main chain. The band gaps deduced from UV - vis absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical studies are 1.78 and 1.84 eV , respectively. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis indicate that the polymer forms a self - assembled π-stacking structure and the polymer takes an interdigitation packing mode. Polymer solar cell has been fabricated with the blend of the TTF - fused polymer and C 60 as the photosensitive layer. The power conversion efficiency is 0.25% under AM 1.5 simulated sun light ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). The intramolecular charge transfer was also confirmed by the chemical oxidation of the polymer with Fe(bpy) 3 ( PF 6 ) 3 ( bpy ) 2,2′-bipyridine ) . The design and synthesis of novel conjugated polymers attract great attention in the field of organic semiconductors due to their ease of preparation , low processing temperature , and nearly unlimited variability. 1 With the successful application of organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , 2 organic electronics is currently expanding its applications to organic photovoltaic devices ( OPVDs ) 3 and organic field effect transistors ( OFETs ). 4 For these device applications , the charge carrier mobility , band gap and electroactivity are the important parameters that should be considered in the design of conjugated polymers. 5 Combining TTF with linear π-conjugated polymers might be an exciting idea for developing the electroactive organic materials. From the viewpoint of tetrathiafulvalene ( TTF ) chemistry , TTF and its derivatives can exist in three stable states , which are TTF 0 , TTF °+ , and TTF 2+ . Thus , grafting TTF redox centers on conjugated polymer may lead to a significant increase of their charge storage capacity. 6 Also , the TTF - fused polymers constitute highly polarizable species due to the large number of sulfur atoms in the structure. The extended conjugation could decrease the intramolecular Coulomb repulsive energy between the donor units and thus enhance intramolecular and interstack interactions. 7 Furthermore , the strong propensity of TTFs to selfassemble into regular π-stacks , when covalently attached to a π-conjugated backbone , may be an interesting approach for indirectly controlling the long - range order of the conjugated chain. The incorporation of TTF units into the conjugated polymers would increase the dimensionality of the charge transport , due to improved electron mobility along the polymer backbone via π-conjugation , as well as along the enhanced stacking direction via π-orbital overlap. 8 There have been many reports on the preparation of conjugated polymers with TTF derivatives either in the main chains or in the side chain. 7,9 But for most of the polymers with TTF side chains , it is difficult to achieve the coplanarity of the main chain and the TTF units.",

    "sentence": "7a In many cases , they can only have partial stacking for the TTF moieties , rather than continuous stacking of the whole molecules. 9a Although the polymers with TTF - fused main chain can form the continuous stacks , they are generally labile to oxidation due to the strong electron - donating property of TTF units , resulting in poor performance when used in electronic or optoelectronic devices. 9d,10 Recently , Yamashita and co-workers found that introducing electron - deficient nitrogen heterocycles to the TTF skeleton could enhance the stability and charge mobility of the formed donor - acceptor ( D-A ) organic molecules. 10 At the same time , combining TTF donor and nitrogen acceptor heterocycle can effectively tailor the HOMO-LUMO gap. Moreover , it is of great benefit to obtain the ambipolar electroactivity by combining electron - donating and accepting abilities. 11 Herein , we report a novel TTF - fused D-A poly(p-aryleneethynylene) , PAE - TTF , where the linear main chain acts as the electron - deficient acceptor and the π-conjugated TTF units act as the electron - rich donors in the side chains ( Chart 1 ). The coplanarity of the main chain with the TTF units ensures that the polymer can easily form continuous stacks , which has been confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction. EPR and UV - vis spectra of PAE - TTF show that there exists intramolecular charge transfer between the TTF side chains and the acceptor main chain. A photovoltaic device based on PAE - TTF has been fabricated and characterized . To investigate the crystallinity of the polymer in the solid state , X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) pattern was collected on a powder sample of the polymer ( Figure 5 ). The diffraction peak at 2θ of 2.26 ° , corresponding to spacing d 1 ) 39.06 Å , is assigned to a distance between the conjugated main chains separated by the long side chains as reported for other similar π-conjugated polymers with long side chains. 23 However , the length of the rigid portion of the side chain is about 15 Å. Adding the two long alkyl chains , the total length of the side chain will reach 29 Å. If the polymer took the end - to - end packing mode , d 1 should be 58 Å , which is far larger than the observed 39.06 Å. So the polymer is considered to assume an interdigitation packing mode rather than an end - to - end packing mode ( Figure 6 ). The diffraction peak d 2 is the second - order peak ( d 2 ) d 1 / 2 ) of the diffraction at d 1 . 23 The effective cross section of the alkyl chains is about S ) 20 Å and their hexagonal - like aggregation gives about d ) 4.2 Å. 24 This value is in agreement with what we observed for the peak at d 3 ( 4.15 Å ) from the polymer.",

    "sentence": "The value of d 4 observed is close to the π-stacking distances of reported TTF - fused D-A organic compounds , which were observed from their single crystal structures. 10,17 So d 4 is considered to be the layer - tolayer π-stacking distance between the coplanar backbones. This value is somewhat larger than the sheet - to - sheet distance of graphite ( 3.35 Å ). 24 The diffraction peaks of d 1 -d 4 was often observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns of poly(aryleneethynylene)s. 25 On the basis of these results , we can suspect that , in the solid state , PAE - TTF forms a good face - to - face stacking consisting of both the π-extended coplanar backbones and the crystallinity of the long alkyl chains. Photovoltaic Property. The intramolecular charge transfer between the TTF side chains and the acceptor main chain and good π-stacking of PAE - TTF indicate that it could possess photovoltaic properties. So we fabricated the polymer solar cell ( PSCs ) with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PAE - TTF : C 60 ( 2 : 1 w / w ) / LiF / Al. Figure 7 shows I-V curves of the device based on PAE - TTF in dark and under the white light illumination ( AM 1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2 ). Preliminary results showed that the corresponding open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short - circuit current ( I sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the device were 0.42 V , 2.47 mA / cm^2 , 24.2% , and 0.25% , respectively. Although the power conversion efficiency is relative low , to our best knowledge , it excels that of other reported TTF - fused ensembles. 5c,26 The intramolecular charge transfer between the TTF side chains and the acceptor main chain could help the exciton charge separation , which may be the reason for the increasing of the power conversion efficiency. We are currently optimizing the polymer and device for better photovoltaic performance . In summary , we have prepared a novel tetrathiafulvalene-(TTF-) fused poly(aryleneethynylene) with an acceptor main chain and donor side chains. There exists intramolecular charge transfer ( CT ) between the electron - rich TTF side chains and the electron - deficient main chain. The electroactivity of the TTF units is closely associated with the HOMO-LUMO levels of the conjugated polymer. The coplanarity of the acceptor main chain and the donor TTF side chains ensures that the polymer forms effective π-π stacking in the solid state. Initial studies showed the photovoltaic property of the polymer PAE - TTF had significant improvement compared with that of other TTF - fused polymer analogues.",

Recently , some new low - bandgap polymers were reported and exhibited better performance up to 5-6 % , 4 which provides a guideline for the material chemists to design and synthesize new polymer materials. In order to obtain high - performance photovoltaic polymer materials , it is necessary to design and synthesize conjugated polymers with ideal properties , such as low bandgap , broad absorption range , high mobility , and appropriate molecular energy levels. One potential strategy to make suitable lowbandgap donor materials is to incorporate chromophors highly absorbing in visible and near - infrared regions. As a class of brilliant red high - performance pigments , 3,6-diaryl-2 , 5dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) has been applied in paints , plastic ink , electroluminescent devices , and transistors. 5,6 The DPP unit has a well - conjugated structure , which leads to strong π-π interaction , 7 and the lactam part makes the DPP unit exhibit a high electron - withdrawing effect , and hence the DPP unit has high electron affinity. 6b Therefore , these properties make the DPP unit a potential electron - withdrawing unit in photovoltaic polymer materials , and its recent applications in organic solar cells appear hopeful. 8 As we know , the required properties of donor materials include not only strong and broad absorption to get good harvesting of sunlight but also proper molecular energy levels to get good charge separation and transportation as well as high open - circuit voltage. Therefore , it is necessary to design and synthesize DPP - based conjugated polymers with ideal properties for realizing high efficiency by copolymerizing with conjugated moieties having different electron - donating properties. In this work , we selected several typical conjugated building blocks to tune the absorption and molecular energy levels to meet the requirements of an ideal donor toward highly efficient photovoltaic performance. Several commonly used conjugated blocks such as dithienosilole , fluorene , benzo [1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene , and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene were copolymerized with DPP units to investigate the relationships between their structures and properties.

    "sentence": "In order to keep good solubility of the DPP derivative M1 , 2-ethylhexyl chains were added to the lactam NH groups. M2 and M4 were synthesized by the reported methods. 4d,9 Compound 8 was synthesized by zinc power reduction reaction on tetraiodobithiophene , compound 7 , at 0 °C in acid conditions. By Stille coupling reaction in toluene using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as catalyst at 110 °C for 18 h , the polymers PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP were obtained with a yield of 40-60 % . All the polymers are soluble in chloroform ( CHCl 3 ) , chlorobenzene , and dichlorobenznene. The weight - average molecular weights ( M w ) of PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) against polystyrene standards in CHCl 3 eluent , and the detailed GPC data are listed in Table 1. The 1H NMR spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure 1. All spectra show signals of the DPP thienoyl protons at about 8.9 ppm and signals of the ethylhexylsubstituted lactam groups of DPP in the region from 0.7 to 1.8 ppm. The signal of the methylene group adjacent to the lactam N atom appears around 4.2 ppm. In all polymers , for every conjugated subunit such as dithienosilole , fluorene , benzo [1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene , and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene , their aromatic protons showed broader resonance peaks ranging from 6.7 to 7.8 ppm due to the polymeric characters. The resonance peaks of the methylene protons ( marked e positions in Figure 1 ) of the ethylhexylor octyl-substituted side chains appear at 1.8 , 1.9 , 3.9 , and 3.0 ppm. Thermal Stability. Thermal stability of the polymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure 2. The TGA analysis reveals that , in the air , the onset points of the weight loss with 5% weight - loss temperature ( T d ) of PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP are 344 , 349 , 319 , and 352 ° C. This indicates that all of them have good thermal stability against oxygen , which is very important in device fabrication process and other kinds of applications. Optical Properties. The photophysical characteristics of the polymers were investigated by ultraviolet - visible ( UV - vis ) absorption spectroscopy in dilute chloroform solutions and as spin - coated films on quartz substrates. Figure 3a shows the absorption spectra of the PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP in chloroform , and the optical data including the absorption peak wavelength ( λ max,abs ) , absorption edge wavelength ( λ edge,abs ) in both solutions and films , and the optical band gap ( E g opt ) are summarized in Table 2.",

    "sentence": "It can be seen from Figure 3a that all the absorption spectra in dilute chloroform appear as two absorption bands. All of the polymers have an absorption band located at 300-500 nm , and the second broad absorption band from 500 to 900 nm in long wavelength region should correspond to the π-π* transition of the conjugated polymer main chains. Absorption spectra of these four polymers appear as near - infrared absorption , and the peaks are located at 798 , 649 , 750 , and 727 nm for PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP , respectively. It was found that all four polymers in long wavelength regions exhibited shoulder peaks , which are related not only to the intermolecular aggregation state caused by the strong polarity of the lactam groups of DPP units 7 but also to the increased vibronic coupling associated with molecular rigidity imposed by molecular connectivity in solution measurements. From Figure 3b it can be seen that these four polymers show extended absorption edges in films in the NIR region , which can be attributed to the more aggregated configuration formed in solid state. The absorption edges are listed in Table 2 , corresponding to the optical bandgaps Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the redox behavior of the polymer and to estimate its HOMO and LUMO energy levels. 12 Figure 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP films on a Pt electrode in a 0.1 mol / L Bu 4 NPF 6acetonitrile solution. The results of the electrochemical measurements are listed in Table 3. It can be seen from Figure 4 that there are irreversible n - doping / dedoping ( reduction / reoxidation ) processes in the negative potential range for all the polymers. However , there is reversible p - doping / dedoping ( oxidation / rereduction ) process in the positive potential range for PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP. The onset oxidation potential ( E ox ) is 0.34 V vs Ag / Ag þ for PDPP - DTS , 0.53 V for PDPP-F , 0.46 V for PDPP - BDT , and 0.51 V for PDPP - BDP. Among the four polymers , PDPP - DTS possesses the lowest onset oxidation potential of 0.34 V , indicating that the electron - donating ability of dithienosilole is the strongest among these four electron - donating units. From the electrochemical oxidation doping results we can conclude that the oxidation potentials of the polymers of PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP are proportional to their corresponding electron - donating abilities of dithienosilole , fluorene , benzo [1,2b;3,4-b]dithiophene , and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene , which also coincide with their optical absorption properties.",

From the onset oxidation potentials ( E onset ox ) and the onset reduction potentials ( E onset red ) of the polymers , HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the energy gap of the polymers were calculated according to the equations LUMO = -e(E red þ 4.7 ) ( eV ) and HOMO = -e(E ox þ 4.7 ) ( eV ) , where the units of E ox and E red are V vs Ag / Ag þ . The E LUMO and the E HOMO values of the polymers are included in Table 3. Table 3 shows In order to make a clear comparison , properties of two other DPP - based polymers , PBBTDPP2 and PCBTDPP , have also been listed in Table 3 according to the reported works. 8a,8e The results indicate that the bandgap as well as the molecular energy level of DPP - based polymers can be adjusted by copolymerizing with different electron - donating groups. When the electron - donating unit was replaced by carbazole , the HOMO energy level even reached -5.44 eV. The LUMO levels of these polymers also vary from -3.47 to -3.92 eV. Photovoltaic Properties. The bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) were fabricated with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymers : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 2 wt % ) / Ca / Al , where the polymers were used as electron donors and PC 70 BM was used as electron acceptor. Figure 6 shows I-V curves of the devices , and Table 4 lists the corresponding V oc , J sc , FF , and PCE of the devices under the illumination of AM 1.5G , 100 mW / cm^2. Figure 6 shows the I-V curves of the devices , and V oc , J sc , FF , and PCE data were collected and listed in Table 4. It is very clear that the PSC devices based on these four DPPbased polymers exhibit different open - circuit voltages , which are consistent with their HOMO levels. For example , PDPP - DTS exhibits a HOMO level of -5.04 eV , which is the highest value among these four materials ; as a result , the open - circuit voltage obtained by PDPP - DTS was the lowest at only 0.55 V ; accordingly , the highest V oc of these four materials was obtained from PDPP-F , the polymer having the lowest HOMO level. As reported , the photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers are very susceptible to molecular structure. Even for the conjugated polymers with identical conjugated main chains , their photovoltaic properties vary with their side chains.",

    "sentence": "For example , the number of carbons in the alkyl side chain of polythiophene can greatly affect the hole mobility of poly(3-alkylthiophene) 13 as well as its photovoltaic properties , 14 and the PCE of poly(3-hexylthiophene) : PCBM - based solar cell is about ∼ 10 times higher than that of the poly-(3-butylthiophene) : PCBM - based device. Therefore , it is hard to reach a solid conclusion by comparison of the parameters , including FF , J sc , and hence PCE , of the devices based on these four DPP - based polymers. It is worthy to mention that another DPP - based polymer , PBBTDPP2 , exhibited some interesting photovoltaic properties in PSC devices. As reported , by using pure dichlorobenzene as solvent during the spin - coating process , the PCE of the device was 2.9% ; however , PCE of the PDPP - BDPbased PSC device can be improved to 4.0% by using a mixed solvent of chloroform and dichlorobenzene. Since the polymer PDPP - BDP exhibited the highest PCE value in these four materials , it was selected to improve photovoltaic properties by using another different treatment during the device fabrication process. In this work , the annealing process in the glovebox was used to improve photovoltaic properties of the PDPP - BDP - based devices. We tried different annealing conditions of the device , and it was found that the best performance was obtained when the device was annealed under 110 °C for 30 min. As shown in Table 4 , after annealing , the J sc and the FF of the device decreased slightly , but the V oc increased from 0.68 to 0.72 V , and as a result , the PCE was improved to 4.45% from 4.31% . This result indicates that annealing is not an effective approach to improve performance of PDPP - BDP - based devices , and further optimizations are in progress. The absorption spectrum of the PDPP - BDP : PC 70 BM blend film prepared under the same conditions as those described in the device fabrication section is shown in Figure 7. The EQE curve of the PSC device is also plotted in Figure 7 for comparison. It is apparent that the device exhibits a very broad response range , covering from 300 to 850 nm , but the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the device is within 40% for almost the whole absorption range. The main reason for the low EQE of the device is due to the limited absorbance value of the active layer ; as shown in Figure 7 , it is known that the absorption in the long wavelength region is contributed by the polymer , and the absorption in the short wavelength region is mainly from PC 70 BM ; however , the peak value of the absorbance in the long wavelength region is only ∼ 0.18 , which means that only a small part of sunlight is absorbed in the device.",

Additionally , a ∼ 5% difference between the J sc and the integral of the EQE by the solar irritation spectrum , AM 1.5G , 100 mW , is observed , which provides good proof of the reliability for the photovoltaic results . To improve the high efficiency of polymer solar cells , a soluble chromophore of 3,6-dithiophen-2-yl-2 , 5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) was copolymerized with different electron - rich building blocks such as dithienosilole , fluorene , benzo [1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene , and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene to yield the polymers of PDPP - DTS , PDPP-F , PDPP - BDT , and PDPP - BDP. UV - vis absorption spectra revealed that the electron - donating ability decreases in the order of dithienosilole , benzo [1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene , benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene , and fluorene , which coincides with their electrochemical data. By fine - tuning the bandgap and molecular level of DPPbased polymers , proper electrochemical energy levels ( HOMO and LUMO ) and a lower bandgap of ∼ 1.3 eV were realized.

The photovoltaic performances of these polymers varied obviously due to different building blocks copolymerized in DPP - based polymers main chains. The best performance of the PSC device was obtained by using PDPP - BDP as the electron donor material , and a PCE of 4.45% with an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.72 V , a short - circuit current ( J sc ) of 10.0 mA / cm^2 , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 61.8% was achieved , which is the best result thus far for DPP - based polymer materials.

    "sentence": "A series of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) conjugated random terpolymers were synthesized by copolymerizing electron - rich alkylthienyl-substituted benzodithiophene ( BDTT ) and two electron - deficient units , a diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) moiety and isoindigo ( TID ) based side chain. The effects of the DPP and TID units on the thermal , photophysical and electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis , UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra , and cyclic voltammetry. Compared with the parent polymers ( P1 and P2 ) , the optical properties of the random terpolymers ( P3-P6 ) were controlled successfully by tuning the ratio of DPP and TID. The increase in TID content induced an increased absorption between 450 and 600 nm and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , while higher DPP content resulted in stronger absorption between 600 and 900 nm. Bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the as-synthesized polymers as electron donors and (6,6)-phenyl-Cbutyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) as the acceptor were fabricated. The best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 5.62% was obtained from P5 ( DPP : TID = 1 : 1 ) due to its high short - circuit current density ( J sc higher than 15 mA cm^-2 ) , mainly arising from the broadened light absorption. The results have demonstrated that the random terpolymers , with complementary light - absorption , have a great potential for increasing the photocurrent and PCE in polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have been studied intensively as promising energy resources with the advantages of being exible , light - weight , and having a low cost. [1][2][3] In the past few years , signicant progress has been made in PSCs with power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) surpassing 10% . 4,5 Although progress has been impressive , the efficiencies of PSCs are still far from their inorganic counterparts. 5 One of the most effective approaches for enhancing PCEs is the development of novel conjugated polymers which exhibit broad light absorption with strong absorptivity , suitable energy level matching with the electron acceptor ( fullerene derivatives ) , and appropriate morphology to promote charge separation and favorable transport of photogenerated charges. 5 As the limited absorption range results in lower short - circuit current density ( J sc , a key parameter for PCEs ) , a broad and intensive absorption is essential for a high PCE. 6 One potential strategy towards broadening the absorption of the solar spectrum is to develop random terpolymers based on the copolymerization of one electron - rich unit and two different electron - decient groups. 3,7,8 It 's worth noting that a judicious selection of one electron - donating group with two different electron - decient units is critical to achieve complementary and broad visible light absorption , thus maximizing photon harvesting.",

    "sentence": "9 As a class of brilliant red pigments , diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) has emerged as an interesting material in paints , plastic ink , electroluminescent devices , thin - lm transistors , and PSC applications. 10,11 It possesses planar and well - conjugated skeletons that give rise to strong p-p interactions and result in absorptions in the near - infrared ( NIR ) region , especially at 600-900 nm. 12,13 Meanwhile , previous work has demonstrated that a new family of polymers with side chains has been successfully developed for PSCs. [14][15][16][17][18] Notably , the polymers with the side chain containing isoindigo ( TID ) exhibited excellent properties , including good lm - forming and a deep - lying energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ). More importantly , there is strong absorption at 300-650 nm. 16 Based on the considerations above , the combination of DPP and TID electron - decient units in a polymer backbone could be ideal for complementary and broad light absorption. 19 Herein , we designed and synthesized a series of novel random terpolymers ( Fig. 1 ) based on one electron - rich unit , alkylthienyl-substituted benzodithiophene ( BDTT ) , 20 and two electron - decient units , DPP and TID , which have broad light absorption ranging from 300 to 900 nm. The much more broadened absorption of the as-synthesized polymers gave a great potential for improving the PSC performance and provided an ideal system for studying the effect of composition on the PSC performances. In terms of the ratio of DPP to TID , the PCEs of the polymers showed a non-linear compositional dependence from 0.67 to 5.62% . The best PCE value of 5.62% was obtained from the device of P5 ( DPP : TID = 1 : 1 ) blended with (6,6)-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) , showing a high J sc value above 15 mA cm^-2 . To understand the effects of DPP and TID on the non-linear compositional dependence of the PCE , the thermal , optical , electrical , and photovoltaic properties of these random terpolymers were systematically investigated . Scheme 1 outlines the general synthetic strategy that we used to obtain the random polymers. M1 and M2 were purchased from a commercial company. M3 was synthesized according to the literature. 16 The polymerization reactions proceeded by the Stille coupling polymerization. The results and thermal properties of the polymers are summarized in Table 1. All of the polymers synthesized in this work have similar number - average molecular weights in the range of 20-40 kg mol^-1 with high solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , tetrahydrofuran , and chlorobenzene . The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Fig. 2. The TGA revealed that the decomposition temperatures ( T d ) of the polymers ( 5% weight loss ) were over 300 C.",

    "sentence": "Obviously , all of the polymers exhibited excellent thermal stability , which is important for their applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices. 22 The optical properties of all of the polymers in the dilute chloroform solution and thin lms are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table 2. In the solution , the binary copolymer P1 exhibits a major absorption band at 600-900 nm with a relatively high absorption coefficient of 6.6 x 10^4 ( g mL -1 ) -1 cm^-1 . The other binary copolymer P2 has a distinct absorption band in 300-600 nm with an absorption coefficient of 4.2 x 10^4 ( g mL -1 ) -1 cm^-1 . As for the random terpolymers ( P3-P6 ) , the relative position and intensity of the absorption peaks were netuned by changing the composition ratio of DPP and TID. By comparing their absorption spectra , a gradual blue - shi was observed when increasing the content of TID , which could be caused to a certain extent by the backbone twist between the main - chain and the side - chain of TID. 16,23 In addition , the increased amount of TID caused the appearance of a new absorption band around 450-600 nm , owing to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) band from BDTT to TID. Meanwhile , the absorption band around 600-900 nm originating from the ICT band from BDTT to DPP gradually decreased with the increasing content of TID. In the solid lms , the absorption maxima of all the polymer lms red - shied in comparison with their solution absorptions , caused to a certain extent by aggregation of the polymer backbones. 24 Additionally , the optical band gaps ( E opt g ) of P1-P6 were estimated to be 1.74 , 1.51 , 1.44 , 1.46^1.26 , and 1.37 eV , respectively , which were determined by the onset of their light absorptions. 25 Comparing to the parent polymers ( P1 and P2 ) , the broad absorptions of the random terpolymers P3-P6 were observed from 300 to 900 nm , indicating that the incorporation of two different electron - decient units into a polymer backbone is an effective method to broaden the absorption band and control the optical band gap . Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the polymers ( Fig. 4 ). The corresponding data are summarized in Table 2.

The onset potentials for reduction ( E red ) were -0.54 , -0.49 , -0.48 , -0.54 , -0.48 , and -0.48 V for P1-P6 , respectively. Accordingly , the HOMO energy levels of the binary polymers , P1 and P2 , were determined to be -5.18 and -5.41 eV , respectively. And the corresponding values of P3-P6 were tuned by controlling the ratios of DPP to TID , with the data ranging from -5.23 to -5.66 eV. Meanwhile , similar calculations for the LUMO energy levels of all of the copolymers proceeded with the values ranging from -3.65 to -3.71 eV. Given the HOMO and LUMO energy levels , all of the polymers have enough driving force for efficient exciton dissociation with fullerene derivatives. 26 In Table 2 , E ec g was slightly larger than E opt g due to the exciton binding energy of the organic conjugated materials. 10 Film morphology is a key parameter to explain the difference in photovoltaic performance. Therefore , we employed AFM with a tapping - mode to investigate the morphology of the polymer : PC61BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) blend lms. The height images and phase images of the polymers are shown in Fig. 5. It could be observed that the blend lm of P3 and P6 exhibited relatively large phase separation ( Fig. 5a and d ) , which went against the transfer of charge. However , the phase separation of P4 and P5 were improved and relatively homogeneous morphologies were achieved by tuning the ratio of DPP to TID. Compared with P4 , an optimized nanoscale interpenetrating network of P5 and PC61BM was obtained ( Fig. 5c ) , which was benecial for the charge transportation , thus leading to the highest J sc as well as the highest device efficiency ( Table 3 and Fig. 7 ) . The charge carrier transport properties of conjugated polymers play a key role in the performance of PSCs. To understand the inuence of charge carrier mobility of the polymers / PC61BM blend lms on the photovoltaic properties , the hole mobilities of the target polymers were measured by a space charge limit current ( SCLC ) method.",

The hole mobility data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 3. The average hole mobilities ( m h,ave ) of P1 , P2 , P4 , P5 , P6 ranged from 1.0 x 10^-5 to 2.9 x 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which contributed to the enhanced J sc of 6.58 - 13.71 mA cm^-2 and the ll factor ( FF ) of 0.44 - 0.51 ( Table 3 ). 28 As for P3 , the value was 2.2 x 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which was consistent with the inferior morphology measured by AFM in Fig. 5 , leading to the relatively lower J sc of 2.24 mA cm^-2 . To investigate whether the DPP unit and TID side group make a contribution to the power conversion efficiency in the PSCs , the bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs for all of the polymers were fabricated with the ITO / MoO 3 ( 10 nm ) / polymer : PC61BM / LiF(0.5 nm ) / Al(100 nm ) structure. 22,27 More than 10 devices were fabricated and their highest efficiencies and average values are provided in Table 3. The optimized weight ratios of polymers to PC61BM are 1 : 2 , except P1 ( 1 : 3 ). Fig. 6 shows the current density versus voltage ( J-V ) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm^-2 . The photovoltaic parameters , including the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , the ll factor ( FF ) , and the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) , are summarized in Table 3. From Table 3 , the V oc of P1 is 0.71 V , which is comparable to the literature values. 13 P2 exhibited the highest value of 0.94 V , probably caused by the larger backbone twists in the mainchain resulting from the TID side chain and the alkylthienyl substituents on benzodithiophene. 29 It is observed that the V oc of the terpolymers ranges from 0.72 to 0.78 V. The non-linear trend is decided by a couple of other factors besides the HOMO levels of the polymers , such as the bulkiness of the side chains , interchain distances , and morphology of the active layers. 30,31 Furthermore , the PCEs of the random terpolymers showed a non-linear compositional dependence from 0.67 to 5.02% in the order : P5 ( 5.02% ) > P4 ( 4.64% ) > P1 ( 4.05% ) > P6 ( 3.75% ) > P2 ( 2.72% ) > P3 ( 0.67% ).",

    "sentence": "In particular , P5 exhibited the highest PCE value of 5.02% ( J sc = 13.71 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.76 V , FF = 0.48 ) among all of the polymers , which was attributed to the broad absorption and increased V oc due to the deep - lying HOMO energy level. In contrast , the PCE decreased in the device of P3 blended with PC61BM ( 0.67% ) , which mainly results from the signicant decrease of the J sc . Based on the maximum efficiency measured from the device of P5 blended with PC61BM , several optimization processes were taken to improve the PCE. One process involved a mixture of chlorobenzene ( CB ) and chloroform ( CF ) as the processing solvent. The highest PCE of 5.62% ( J sc = 15.13 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.76 V , FF = 0.49 ) was achieved when the volume ratio of CB to CF was 7 : 3.^32 The other process used PC71BM as the electron acceptor. In spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , P5 blended with PC71BM showed a lower PCE value of only 2.49% . In addition , physical blending of P1 and P2 with the weight ratio 1 : 1 was used as a reference with a lower PCE of 3.54% ( J sc = 10.08 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.75 V , FF = 0.46 ). The results demonstrated that developing random terpolymers based on the copolymerization is more effective than physical blending. Meanwhile , PSCs based on the as-synthesized polymers blended with PC61BM were tested for their incident photon - tocurrent conversion efficiencies ( IPCE ). Typical curves are shown in Fig. 7. The IPCE spectra exhibited well - matched curves with their optical absorptions and a close correlation with their photocurrents in the J-V curves. The device based on P1 exhibited two major responses , 300-500 nm and 500-900 nm , with a maximum IPCE of 45% . In comparison with the optical absorption prole of P1 , it is clear that a large proportion of electron charge is generated from the absorption of PCBM. 5 As for P2 , the device only exhibited a response from 300 nm to 650 nm , with a relatively low maximum IPCE of 50% at 447 nm. As shown in Fig. 7 , the IPCE of P3 was extremely low , which corresponds to the bad separation and transport of the photogenerated charges originating from the inferior morphology and the minimum hole mobility. Besides , the IPCEs of P4-P6 in the range 300-900 nm were observed in all devices , suggesting that the photon electron conversion processes were rather effective , which further demonstrated the better performance. Obviously , P5 shows the highest IPCE among them , which is in line with the J sc .",

The optimal ratio of 1 : 1 between DPP and TID in the random terpolymers increased the efficiency to 5.62% due to the improved light absorption and a high J sc value of 15 mA cm^-2 .

    "sentence": "Two donor - acceptor ( D-A ) alternative copolymers of benzodithiophene ( BDT ) donor unit and an acceptor unit of naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione ( NTDO ) with different alkyl side chains , PBDTNTDO-1 and PBDTNTDO-2 , were synthesized for application as donor materials in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). The copolymers show good solubility in common organic solvents , broad visible absorption from 350 nm to 670 nm , and relatively lower HOMO energy levels at -5.14 eV for PBDTNTDO-1 and -5.19 eV for PBDTNTDO-2. The PSCs based on PBDTNTDO-2 as donor and PC 70 BM as acceptor demonstrated power conversion efficiency of 1.52% with an open circuit voltage of 0.88 V and a short circuit current of 5.67 mA cm^-2 , under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure of polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors have been attracting considerable attention due to their unique advantages of low cost , light weight , and mechanical flexibility. [1][2][3][4][5] The central concern of the studies of PSCs is to increase the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the devices. As we know , the PCE is proportional to the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short circuit current ( J sc ) and fill factor ( FF ) of the PSCs. Therefore , for the conjugated polymer donor materials in the active layer of PSCs , the key issues we should consider in their molecular design are broad absorption spectra to enhance sunlight harvest for higher J sc , appropriately lower HOMO ( the highest occupied molecular orbital ) energy levels to maximize the V oc , and higher hole mobility for higher J sc and higher FF of the PSCs. Donor - acceptor ( D-A ) copolymers have drawn great attentions for the conjugated polymer donor materials in recent years , because of easy tuning of their bandgap , absorption spectra and HOMO energy level by using different donor and acceptor units in the copolymers. [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] Benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b 0 ] dithiophene ( BDT ) is the most successful donor unit in constructing high efficiency photovoltaic donor copolymers , not only in the narrow bandgap copolymers with thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit [16][17][18][19] but also in the D-A copolymers with different acceptor units. [20][21][22][23] The advantages of the BDT units include its planar conjugated structure and easy purification of BDT monomers , and the BDT - based conjugated polymers show high hole mobility , for example , the hole mobility of a copolymer of BDT and thiophene reached 0.25 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . 24 In order to enrich the family of the BDT - based D-A copolymers and look for new conjugated polymers for the application as donor materials in PSCs , here we designed and synthesized two new BDT - based D-A copolymers with an acceptor unit of naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione ( NTDO ) , PBDTNTDO-1 , PBDTNTDO-2 ( see Scheme 1 ).",

    "sentence": "NTDO is easy to synthesize , and possesses a relatively simple and planar structure which could be beneficial to the electron delocalization when it is incorporated into the D-A copolymers. Besides , its relatively strong electronwithdrawing ability would lead to lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the D-A copolymers , which is desirable for obtaining higher open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the PSCs. The difference of the two copolymers is the alkyl chain substituent on Scheme 1 Synthetic route for the PBDTNTDO copolymers. Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences , CAS Key Laboratory of Organic Solids , Institute of Chemistry , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing , 100190 , China the NTDO unit. The two copolymers show good solubility in common organic solvents , broad visible absorption from 350 nm to 670 nm and relatively lower HOMO energy levels. The PSCs based on PBDTNTDO-2 as donor and PC 70 BM as acceptor demonstrated PCE of 1.52% with a V oc of 0.88 V and a J sc of 5.67 mA cm^-2 , under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . The general synthetic routes for naphtho [2,3-c]thiophene-4,9dione ( NTDO ) monomer 1 ( M1 ) and monomer 2 ( M2 ) are shown in Scheme 2. Benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b 0 ] dithiophene ( BDT ) was synthesized according to the procedure reported in literature. 16,25 The copolymers of PBDTNTDO-1 and PBDTNTDO-2 were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction , as shown in Scheme 1. The two copolymers possess good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , toluene , and chlorobenzene. Molecular weights of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration. The number - average molecular weight ( M n ) is 24 K for PBDTNTDO-1 and 13 K for PBDTNTDO-2. The polydispersity indices ( PDIs ) of PBDTNTDO-1 and PBDTNTDO-2 are 2.48 and 3.07 respectively. The molecular weights and PDI values of the copolymers were listed in Table 1. Thermal stability of the copolymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Fig. 1. The TGA analysis reveals that the onset temperatures with 5% weight - loss ( T d ) of PBDTNTDO-1 and PBDTNTDO-2 are 308 and 334 °C respectively. The thermal stability of the two copolymers is similar , and it is adequate for the applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices . Fig. 2 shows the ultraviolet - visible ( UV - vis ) absorption spectra of the polymer dilute solutions in chloroform and films spincoated on quartz substrates. PBDTNTDO-1 and PBDTNTDO-2 solutions display broad absorption spectra in the wavelength range of 350-650 nm with the absorption maxima at 549 and 541 nm respectively. The absorption peak of PBDTNTDO-1 solution is 8 nm red - shifted compared to that of PBDTNTDO-2 solution. PBDTNTDO-1 and PBDTNTDO-2 films show almost same absorption peak wavelength at ca. 554 nm.",

    "sentence": "Various low ratio of platinum complexes ( 0 , 1 , 1.5 and 5 mol % ) are introduced as the third monomer to the conjugated backbone of famous donor polymer PTB7-Th through random terpolymer molecular design approach. All the polymers show similar absorption behavior and comparably HOMO / LUMO energy levels due to the very small amount of Pt complex. When blended with PC71BM in polymer solar cells , enhanced power conversion efficiency to 8.45% is obtained in 1.5 mol % Pt containing PTB7 - ThPt1.5 based device compared to 7.92% of the control PTB7 - Th. It should be noted that the apparently lower molecular weight of PTB7 - ThPt1.5 ( Mn / Mw : 46 / 70 kg / mol ) than PTB7-Th ( Mn / Mw : 62 / 97 kg / mol ) ensures a more convincing comparasion. Through a combination of physical measurement , such as optoelectrical characterization , grazing incident wide - angle X-ray diffraction ( GIWAXS ) and pico - second time - resolved photoluminescence , the efficiency enhancement are contributed from comprehensive factors of higher hole mobility , less bimolecular recombination and more efficient slow process of charge separation . Bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted intense attention as the potential photovoltaic technology due to the merits of simple fabrication , low cost , light weight , flexibility and large area mass production. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Donor - acceptor type conjugated copolymers utilizing the electron push - pull concept which consists of alternatively linked electron - donating ( D ) and electron - accepting ( A ) units along the polymer chain have been attracted great attention for high performance BHJ PSCs. [8][9][10] The solubility , film forming property , absorption range , bandgaps , HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as charge transport properties can be facially tuned by reasonable molecular design on the appropriate combination of donor and acceptor structural units. Although a huge number of donor and acceptor units have been reported , only a few D-A alternating copolymers exhibits power conversion efficiency over 9% in polymer / fullerene or polymer / polymer single junction photovoltaic devices. 11 Further exploration of new D-A alternating copolymers seems to face the bottleneck , as the involvement of challenging multi-step synthesis for the new donor or acceptor units may lead to higher costs , which are not beneficial for large - scale production. Recently , a new structural design strategy of random terpolymers has been found to be effective approach for designing new conjugated polymer materials. Unlike the conventional D-A alternating copolymers , terpolymers comprise of three different monomeric units as the repeating group in the conjugated polymer backbone. [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The judicious selection of the newly involved third monomeric moieties plays a key role in fine - tuning of physical and optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers.",

    "sentence": "Normally , two architectures employed for random terpolymers are D1-A-D2-A by utilizing two donor units for copolymerizing with one acceptor unit and A1-D-A2-D by involving two acceptor and one donor units. For example , in our previous work , replacing 25 mol % of rather expensive 3-fluorothieno [3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate accepting monomer by a 34-times lower - cost bithiophene third donor monomer in the famous D-A conjugated copolymer PTB7-Th , the new terpolymer PTB7-Th-T2 exhibited PCE of 8.19% , which was even slightly higher than 7.89% of the control PTB7-Th at the same device fabrication conditions. 21 By introducing two electron deficient 5,6-difluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole - based monomers and one electron rich benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene containing monomer to form the random terpolymer , the PCE of the polymer / PC71BM BHJ device could be increased from 4.9% ( Th00 ) and 6.9% ( Th100 ) of the two alternative copolymers to 8.0% of the terpolymer Th25. 22 It is noted that only a few random terpolymers have been successfully obtained with PCE values over 8% . [21][22][23][24][25] On the other hand , up to date , the reported third monomers which have been Journal Name 2 | J. Name. , 2012 , 00 , 1-3 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins classified either as electron - donating ( D ) or accepting ( A ) units for terpolymers are mostly pure organic components. However , other third monomers such as organometal complexes were scarcely demonstrated in random terpolymers for high efficiency BHJ PSCs. The few representatives were limited to Zinc porphyrins derivatives which was incorporated into the D-A conjugated backbone of diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) containing PBT - DPP or difluorobenzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole based PTh4FBT , as well as the cyclometalated heavy metal iridium complex which was linked to PTB7 polymer backbone through ancillary ligand. 20,23,24 In this work , we adopted the terpolymer approach by embedding various low ratio of heavy metal Pt complex to the famous donor polymer of PTB7-Th through the cyclometalated main ligand. By using 1.5 mol % of PyTPAPtacac as the third monomer for random polymerization , the Pt containing PTB7 - ThPt1.5 exhibited the best PCE in polymer / PC71BM blended BHJ devices. At the same device fabrication condition , increased PCE with an average value of 8.25% was obtained for PTB7 - ThPt1.5 compared to 7.81% of PTB7 - Th. Particularly , the molecular weight for PTB7 - ThPt1.5 ( Mn / Mw : 46 / 70 kg / mol ) was obviously lower than the control PTB7-Th ( Mn / Mw : 62 / 97 kg / mol ) , which further indicated the successful terpolymer strategy for the enhancement of PCE on the introduction of extremely low ratio of Pt complexes as the third monomer. Through a combination of optical and electrical investigations , the positive effect could be ascribed to higher hole mobility , less bimolecular recombination and more efficient slow process of charge separation .",

The maximum absorption peaks in the solid film were slightly red - shifted compared with solution. All polymers exhibited similar absorption behavior in the range from 300 to 800 nm. The short wavelength absorption bands ( 300-400 nm ) could be attributed to the π-π* transitions within the aromatic monomer , while the long wavelength absorption bands ( > 500 nm ) were originated from the intramolecular charge - transfer ( ICT ) transitions between the electron donating and accepting segments. As the real content of Pt in terpolymers was even lower than the dBrTPAPyPtacac monomer ratio for polymerization , the absorption features for Pt complex was negligible due to the extremely low content. However , the ~ 300 nm absorption bands which partially assigned to the triphenylamine - centered n-π* transition for polymer PTB7 - ThPt5 exhibited the highest intensity , indicating the highest content of cyclometalated TPA containing Pt complex. Almost identical optical bandgaps ( Eg opt ) of 1.53 - 1.56 eV for all polymers were calculated from the corresponding absorption edge at film state. Besides , the HOMO ( highest occupied molecular orbital ) and LUMO ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) energy levels measured by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) ( Figure 2 ) for different polymers were determined from -5.29 to -5.39 eV and -3.42 to -3.50 eV ( Table 1 ) , respectively , suggesting little difference on the energy levels ( < 0.1 eV ) by incorporation small amount of Pt complexes .

However , further increase the Pt monomer to 5 mol % , PCE significantly dropped to an average value of 7.11% , as demonstrated by the lowest JSC of only 13.50 mA / cm^2 , possible reason might be ascribed that the introducing of too much poor charge transport Pt complex as the third monomer dramatically reduced the polymer molecular weight and charge transport properties of the polymer. Figure 3b demonstrated the EQE curves for the PTB7 - ThPtx ( x = 0 , 1 , 1.5 , and 5 ) based photovoltaic devices to verify the measured JSC values. All devices showed a broad and strong absorption in the range of 350-750 nm. The maximum EQE was approaching 72% at ~ 630 nm for PTB7 - ThPt1.5 containing device. In the range of 600-750 nm , the EQE for devices using 1.5 mol % of Pt complex containing PTB7 - ThPt1.5 as donor material exhibited the highest values , followed by 1% of PTB7 - ThPt1 , the control PTB7-Th and the 5 mol % Pt complex based PTB7 - ThPt5. The measured JSC from the BHJ PSC devices were well - matched with the values calculated from the integration of EQE curves ( within 5% error ) , which confirmed the accuracy of PCE from the measurement. Grazing incident wide - angle X-ray scattering ( GIWAXS ) of the polymer / PC71BM blended films was carried out to investigate possible structural changes in the series of Pt complex containing terpolymers compared to the control PTB7 - Th. The twodimensional GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding scattering profiles in the in-plane and out - of - plane directions for representative blended samples with or without Pt content are shown in Figure 4. At the first glance , no significant differences on their pattern properties were found for all samples , especially similar peaks becomes clearer in the 1D profile either at the inplane and out - of - plane directions , which is originated from the extremely low ratio of Pt complex to the PTB7-Th polymer backbone. However , after further careful observation , the pattern intensities for the broad peak arisen at q ≈ 1.37 Å the increase of Pt content in the polymer backbone , and the 5 mol % Pt containing PTB7 - ThPt5 / PC71BM blends exhibited the lowest intensity , indicating the least aggregation of PC71BM.",

Similarly , PTB7 - ThPt5 / PC71BM blends displayed the lowest intensity , indicating reduced lamellar stacking. Meanwhile , as previously reported , the intensity of the ( 010 ) face-on π-π stacking peak with qz ≈ 1.6 Å -1 for PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends was significantly weaker than the pure PTB7-Th film due to PC71BM destroys the crystallinity of PTB7 - Th. 32 In addition , the introduction of Pt complex in the terpolymers further reduced the originally weakened π-π stacking peak in PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends , and this peak even disappeared in PTB7 - ThPt5 based film , indicating the poorest molecular packing of the donor polymer , which was ascribed to the lowest molecular weight and the introduce of excess Pt complex. 33 It is suggested that the conjugation of a third monomer to PTB7-Th destroyed the essential symmetry and integrality of the polymer backbone , and thus lead to slightly reduced molecular stacking of the donor polymers and the aggregation of PC71BM. To give more insights of the enhanced PCE by the terpolymer approach of Pt complex , hole mobilities of the active layers for PTB7 - ThPtx / PC71BM blends were measured by the space chargelimited current ( SCLC ) method with the device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymers : PC71BM / Au. As shown in Figure 5a , the hole transport mobility ( μh ) for PTB7-Th and PTB7 - ThPtx / PC71BM ( x = 1 , 1.5 and 5 ) blends , was estimated to be 1.36 × 10^-3 , 2.68 × 10^-3 , 5.3 × 10^-3 and 4.86 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. The PTB7 - ThPt1.5 blends including 1.5 mol % of Pt complex displayed the highest hole mobility , followed by PTB7 - ThPt1 and PTB7 - Th. The PTB7 - ThPt5 with the most Pt content and the lowest molecular weight demonstrated the poorest charge transport property. It is found that the trends of hole mobility for the polymer / PC71BM blends are in good agreement with the PCE values of the BHJ PSCs. We further studied the light intensity ( P ) dependencies on the short - circuit current density ( JSC ) to determine the non-geminate recombination losses in the devices. Generally , the relationship between JSC and light intensity follows the formula of JSC ∝P S . 34,35 If all free carriers were swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination , S should be equal to 1 , while S < 1 indicates some extent of bimolecular recombination.",

The value of the PTB7 - ThPt1.5 containing device is much more close to 1 , indicating a more efficient transport of carriers and the mostly suppressed bimolecular recombination , which agrees very well with its highest PCEs. To further investigate the influence of Pt complex on the PCE of polymer / fullerene BHJ PSCs , pico - second time - resolved photoluminescence ( PL ) was conducted to compare the PL decay dynamics ( Figure 6 ). It is reported that ultrafast coherent longrange charge separation as well as the slower process of charge separation via multiple hopping steps between localized states due to morphology and disorder determines the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices. 36 All PL dynamics exhibited a bi-exponential decay. The fast picosecond decay channel is similar for all blends and may result from the dissociation of charge - transfer state excitons at the polymer / fullerene D-A interface , while the longer decay channel with several hundred picoseconds can possibly be explained by the effective radiative lifetime of PC71BM. 37 Compared with the control polymer PTB7-Th , the relative contribution on the ARTICLE Journal Name 6 | J.

And this more efficient slow process of charge separation is beneficial to the photovoltaic device performance. 33,38 However , the PTB7 - ThPt5 / PC71BM blends exhibited the slowest longer time PL decay , which possibly suggest the poorest slow process of charge separation. As demonstrated from the GIWAXS study , the PC71BM aggregation was mostly reduced , the somewhat amorphous state of PC71BM in PTB7 - ThPt5 / PC71BM blends greatly reduced the singlet exciton transport . In inclusion , we have introduced various low ratio of heavy metal Pt complex ( 0 , 1 , 1.5 and 5 mol % ) as the third monomer for polymerization through cyclometalated main ligand. The 1.5 mol % Pt containing PTB7 - ThPt1.5 based BHJ PSCs exhibited enhanced PCE of 8.45% compared with 7.92% of the control copolymer PTB7-Th even at obviously lower molecular weight condition.

    "sentence": "Solution - processed bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) 1 polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have received considerable attention because of their appealing features including low - cost , light - weight , flexibility and good compatibility with the roll - to - roll process for making large area devices. 2 Over the past few years , extensive efforts have been devoted to developing low bandgap polymers consisting of electron donating ( D ) and electron accepting ( A ) unit by utilizing the electron push - pull concept. [3][4] The optical bandgaps , absorption ranges and frontier orbital energy levels have been successfully tuned by varying the electron donors or acceptors. 5 Blends of these conjugated D-A polymers with appropriate electron acceptors have led to PSCs with high power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) . Bandgap , HOMO / LUMO energy and thin film crystallinity are the key metrics of conjugated D-A polymers. Various electron rich-or deficient - conjugated frameworks have been linked and optimized to construct conjugated D-A polymers for high performance PSCs. 4,[6][7][8][9] Recently , conjugated D-A polymers incorporating additional acceptor or donor moieties in the backbones , which are referred to as conjugated donoracceptor terpolymers , have received increasing attentions. [10][11][12] The electron donor - acceptor interactions within the D-A polymers can red - shift the absorptions , but the absorptions in the short wavelength regions , in particular in the visible region , are usually weakened. 13 However , the incorporation of appropriate additional electron acceptor or donor moieties may enable to finely tune and optimize the absorptions. Moreover , by properly choosing co-monomers ( D or A ) and varying the copolymerization molar ratios , HOMO / LUMO energies and thin film morphologies of conjugated polymers can be finely tuned. [10][11][12] For these reasons , conjugated donoracceptor terpolymers are of significant interests as electron donors for high performance PSCs. 12 For instance , Jo and coworkers reported conjugated random terpolymers entailing diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) and isoindigo as co-acceptors ; in comparison with the respective DPP - based and isoindigobased D-A polymers the terpolymers showed strong absorptions and low - lying HOMO levels which led to higher J SC ( short - circuit current ) and V OC ( open - circuit voltage ) for the PSCs. 12a They further prepared the terpolymer with thiophenecapped DPP and pyridine - capped DPP as co-acceptors , and PSCs with PCE up to 8.11% were fabricated with such terpolymer. 12b TBPD shown in Scheme 1 , as a derivative of Pechmann dye 14 with two capped-thiophenes , owns planar and polar structure with bis-amide as electron withdrawing units. Being similar to DPP , TBPD can function as electron acceptor. Some of us investigated both alternating D-A copolymers and small D-A-D molecules with TBPD as the accepting moieties , and both ambipolar and p - type semiconducting behaviors with charge mobilities above 1.0 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 were observed. 15 thiophenes in TBPD with two phenyl groups in order to lower the HOMO energy.",

    "sentence": "Then , we describe the preparation and photovoltaic application of three conjugated random D-A terpolymers PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 ( see Scheme 1 ) , which entail BBPD and dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole ( TDPP ) as coacceptors with different molar ratios , and thiophene as the electron donor. The results reveal that the HOMO energy levels , absorption ranges and thin film morphologies can be tuned by varying the BBPD / TDPP molar ratios. The blend thin film of PBPD1 : PC71BM exhibits better photovoltaic performance with PCE up to 5.21% than the respective ones of PBPD2 and PBPD3 , and the homopolymer PDPP3T as well . Fig. S2 shows the cyclic voltammograms of dibromo-BBPD and dibromo-TBPD , and their absorption spectra in solution. For calibration the redox potential of ferrocene ( Fc ) was measured under the same condition. The respective onset oxidation and reduction potentials of dibromo-BBPD were presented by reference to the redox potential of ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) ( see ( -3.60 eV ). Dibromo-BBPD shows absorptions in the range of 400^-650 nm with a maximum at 563 nm , which is blue - shifted by comparing with that of dibromo-TBPD ( λ max = 615 nm ). In a similar way , the HOMO / LUMO energies of PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 were estimated and listed in Table 1. By comparing with those of PDPP3T , the HOMO energies of these 18a-18c D-A terpolymers were lowered , while their LUMO energies increased slightly by increasing the content of BBPD in the backbones ( see Fig. 1 ). For instance , the HOMO / LUMO energies of PBPD3 were estimated to be -5.24 eV and -3.63 eV , respectively. Conjugated D-A polymers with low HOMO levels are expected to increase V OC of the PSCs. 18 But , bandgaps of PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 based on the cyclic voltammetric data are larger than that of PDPP3T and increase in the following order : PBPD1 ( 1.53 eV ) < PBPD2 ( 1.56 eV ) < PBPD3 ( 1.61 eV ). Thus , it is necessary to adjust the content of BBPD in the backbone to afford D-A terpolymers with wide absorptions and appropriate HOMO / LUMO levels simultaneously. It is noted that the HOMO levels of these terpolymers are slightly changed when increasing the content of BBPD. This is consistent with the DFT calculations with the following repeated units : thiophene-TDPP-thiophene-TDPP ( M1 ) , thiophene-BBPD-thiophene-TDPP ( M2 ) , thiophene-BBPDthiophene-BBPD ( M3 ) in Fig. 2 as discussed below. The alteration of HOMO / LUMO levels for PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 in comparison with PDPP3T is in good agreement with the density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations ( see Fig. 2 and Supporting Information ). DFT calculations at the B3LYP / 6-31G ( d ) level were performed for the corresponding repeating units.",

    "sentence": "To simplify the calculations , we just took the following repeated units : thiophene-TDPP-thiophene-TDPP ( M1 ) , thiophene-BBPD-thiophene-TDPP ( M2 ) , thiophene-BBPDthiophene-BBPD ( M3 ) for studies , and the branching alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. HOMO / LUMO energies of M1 , M2 , M3 were calculated to be -4.58 / -2.74 eV , -4.63 / -2.71 eV and -4.65 / -2.68 eV , respectively. Although discrepancies exist between the calculated HOMO / LUMO energies and those determined based on the respective cyclic voltammetric data , the calculation results also indicate that the incorporation of BBPD lowers the HOMO level and increases the LUMO level. It should be noted both HOMO and L U M O orbitals of M1 , M2 and M3 are well distributed over their conjugated backbones ( see Fig. 2 ) , which are beneficial for charge carrier transporting. 19 Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of the solutions and thin films of all the polymers. Solutions of PBPD1 , PBPD2 , P B P D 3 and PDPP3T exhibit strong absorptions at 722 nm ( ε max = 48000 M -1 cm^-1 ) , 686 nm ( ε max = 33000 M -1 cm^-1 ) , 650 nm ( ε max = 28000 M -1 cm^-1 ) and 808 nm ( ε max = 56000 M -1 cm^-1 ) , respectively ( Table 1 ). In comparison , absorptions of thin films of PBPD1 , PBPD2 , PBPD3 and PDPP3T are red - shifted compared to the respective maxima absorptions of their solutions , which may be owing to the π-π interactions between the conjugated polymer chains according to previous studies. 20 It is obvious to note that the absorptions of both solutions and thin films of PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 are blueshifted compared to PDPP3T ; as the ratio of BBPD unit increases , the degree of blue - shift increases. As shown in Fig. S3A and the absorptions can be broadened by introducing appropriate amounts of BPD in the DPP polymers. PDPP3T exhibits a strong absorption at 808 nm and a shoulder peak at 748 nm in solution , whereas thin film of PDPP3T show absorptions at 834 nm and 770 nm. Similarly , the solution of PBPD1 absorbs strongly at 722 nm and two absorptions at 808 nm and 754 nm are detected for its thin film. Thus , the absorptions around 834 nm and 808 nm for thin films of PDPP3T and PBPD1 may be ascribed to the respective interchain interactions. Compared to PDPP3T and PBPD1 , the thin film absorptions of PBPD2 and PBPD3 are blue - shifted. As discussed below , thin morphologies of PBPD2 and PBPD3 are obviously different from those of PDPP3T and PBPD1 , indicating the interchain interactions for thin films of PBPD2 and PBPD3 are likely different from those of PDPP3T and PBPD1.",

    "sentence": "This may explain the observation that thin films of PDPP3T and PBPD1 show two absorption peaks in the long wavelength region , while PBPD2 and PBPD3 exhibit one absorption peak in the range of 700-800 nm. On the basis of the respective onset absorptions of their thin films , their optical gaps were estimated to be 1.33 eV for PBPD1 , 1.39 eV for PBPD2 , 1.41 eV for PBPD3 and 1.31 eV for PDPP3T , respectively. The cyclic voltammetric and spectral studies demonstrate that HOMO / LUMO levels and absorption ranges of these D-A terpolymers can be tuned and broadened by varying the two acceptor ( BBPD and TDPP ) ratios. The photovoltaic parameters of the best performance devices are shown. The data are based on more than 10 devices ; b As-casted thin films ; c o-dichlorobenzene / 1,8-diiodooctane ( 100 / 3 , v / v ) ; d data were provided in \" average(highest) \" form respectively , after thermal annealing at 80 °C . The respective blends of PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 with PC71BM at weight ratios of 1 : 2 gave the best photovoltaic performances. As listed in Table 2 , the open circuit voltages ( V OC ) of PSCs with PBPD1 : PC71BM , PBPD2 : PC71BM and PBPD3 : PC71BM are higher than that with PDPP3T:PC71BM. This can be explained by considering the fact that HOMO energies of PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 are lower than that of PDPP3T , and they decrease in the following order : PBPD1 > PBPD2 > PBPD3 ( see Table 1 ). But , J sc and FF are relatively small for PSCs with these blending thin films and as a result PCEs are not significantly high. Among the blending thin films PBPD1 : PC71BM yields the highest PCE up to 5.21% . This is in agreement with the IPCE spectra shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 6 depicts the two dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction ( 2D GIXRD ) patterns for these blends. Only one diffraction arc along the q z direction , corresponding to ( 100 ) diffraction , at q z = ~ 0.34 Å -1 ( corresponding a d-spacing of 18.4 Å ) , was detected for all the blending thin films. In comparison , relatively strong ( 100 ) diffraction was observed for PBPD1 : PC71BM as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S4. No diffractions for interchain π-π stacking were detected for all blending thin films. The differences in surface morphology and packing order degree may explain the observation that PBPD1 : PC71BM shows higher IPCE than PDPP3T:PC71BM , although the difference between the absorptions of PBPD1 and PDPP3T is small. To conclude , these AFM images , TEM images and 2D GIXRD data agree well with the observation that PBPD1 : PC71BM shows relatively good photovoltaic performance , while other blends exhibit low power conversion efficiencies .",

BBPD has been successfully incorporated into the backbone of DPP - based conjugated polymer to afford three conjugated D-A terpolymers PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 with different molar ratios of BBPD vs TDPP ( Scheme 1 ). The results reveal that HOMO levels become gradually lower by increasing the BBPD content in the terpolymers. The absorptions of these terpolymers are blue - shifted in comparison with that of PDPP3T without BBPD , and PBPD1 shows strong and broad absorptions in the range of 500-1000 nm. PBPD1 , PBPD2 and PBPD3 exhibit ambipolar semiconducting properties , and among these terpolymers PBPD1 shows highest hole and electron mobilities up to 0.604 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and 0.225 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . They have been also examined as electron donors for PSCs after blending with PC71BM.

    "sentence": "A series of novel thiophene-and selenophenebased low - bandgap polymers were synthesized using a Stille crosscoupling reaction ; these polymers contained quinoxaline and diketopyrrolopyrrole as acceptors. Various acceptors were introduced into the selenophene backbones , and the solubility , absorption spectra , energy levels , charge transport , blend film morphology , and photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers were investigated. The weight - averaged molecular weights ( M w ) of Organic solar cells based on conjugated polymers have the potential to be applied as a clean energy source. In addition , such cells have the advantages that they can be fabricated at low cost via solution - based processing and that they have mechanical flexibility appropriate for foldable or rollable substrates. 1-4 Bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) devicesin which a donor polymer ( p - type ) is blended with a fullerene derivative or other acceptor ( n - type ) materialhave emerged as the most efficient polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) developed to date. 5-7 One of the main factors limiting the performance of PSCs is the mismatch between their absorption and the terrestrial solar spectra. Polymer materials with low bandgaps are therefore needed to harvest solar photons at longer wavelengths , particularly in the near-IR region , and with a broader spectrum. Conjugated polymers that incorporate alternating donor and acceptor units produce significant decreases in the bandgap , due to the introduction of intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) structures. 8-10 Several types of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) conjugated copolymers have been synthesized for use in highperformance organic photovoltaic ( OPV ) applications. The use of thiophene as a donating moiety and quinoxaline ( Qx ) and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) as accepting moieties has been closely investigated and provides a successful strategy to achieve low - bandgap materials. 11,12 Compared with their thiophene analogues , selenophene - containing polymers have been studied to a lesser extent , possibly due to the difficulties associated with their synthesis. As a class , polyselenophenes are expected to have advantages over polythiophenes. For example , interchain charge transfer should be facilitated by the intermolecular Se- Se contact , which means that polyselenophenes should have higher bulk conductivities and mobilities than polythiophenes. 13 Furthermore , selenophene substitution in conjugated polymers reduces the bandgap energy , mainly by stabilizing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) level more effectively than the corresponding polythiophenes. 14-16 Poly(3hexylselenophene) ( P3HS ) displays a bandgap energy ( 1.6 eV ) lower than that of P3HT ( 1.9 eV ). 15 The photovoltaic properties of P3HS : PCBM devices result in a high power conversion efficiency ( 2.7% ) because P3HS provides a more extensive photon absorption cross section than P3HT. 14 Poly(3,3-dialkylterselenophene) ( PSSS ) also exhibits high charge - carrier mobilities and ambipolar behaviors in organic field effect transistor devices ; the low LUMO energy levels are thought to facilitate both electron injection and transport.",

These polymers were synthesized using a Stille cross-coupling reaction , with terselenophene as a donor and quinoxaline ( Qx ) and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) as acceptors. The Qx - containing polymers are denoted as P3SDTQ , and those containing DPP are denoted as P3SDTDPP. These polymers have lower bandgaps in πconjugated polymers , thereby increasing the overall photon absorption by extending the spectral sensitivity. We examined the effects of the incorporation of different acceptors in the selenophene backbones on the absorption , energy levels , charge transport properties , morphologies , and photovoltaic properties of the donor / acceptor blends. In addition , terthiophene - based D-A polymers ( with terthiophene as a donor and quinoxaline ( Qx ) ( P3TDTQ ) and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) ( P3TDTDPP ) as acceptors ) were also synthesized using the same polymerization method , to allow a comparison between the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of the terthiophene - based D-A polymers and those of the selenophene - based polymers . . The weight - average molecular weights ( M w ) of P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP were determined using gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , using a polystyrene standard in a chloroform eluent ; they were found to be 12^300 ( PDI = 1.46 ) , 15^500 ( PDI = 1.85 ) , 13^300 ( PDI = 1.58 ) , and 17^200 ( PDI = 1.63 ) , respectively. The polymer readily dissolved in common organic solvents such as toluene , chloroform , and THF and formed good films. Thermal analysis of the polymers was conducted using differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure 1. The results showed that both polymers had good thermal stability over 300 °C , and no obvious thermal transitions were observed between 50 and 200 °C . The polymerization results for the synthesized copolymers are summarized in Table 1. Optical and Electrochemical Properties. The UV - vis absorption spectra of the copolymers are shown in Figure 2 for copolymers in a dilute chlorobenzene solution and in thin films ; the absorption data for the polymers are summarized in Table 2.",

    "sentence": "The λ max of P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP in solution occurred at 549 , 599 , 679 , and 702 nm , respectively , whereas those in the thin films occurred at 587 , 619 , 716 , and 753 nm , respectively ; these values were significantly red - shifted compared with those of poly(3,3dialkylterthiophene) ( PTT , λ max,film = 510 nm ) and poly(3,3dialkylterselenophene) ( PSSS , λ max,film = 614 nm ). 16,21 The UV - vis absorption spectra of the P3S - based polymers ( P3SDTQ and P3SDTDPP ) were red - shifted by about 20- 50 nm with respect to those of the P3T - based polymers ( P3TDTQ and P3TDTDPP ) , both in solution and in thin films ; this resulted from the presence of selenium atoms in the polymer repeat units. Selenium atoms are more electron - rich than sulfur atoms ; hence , aromatic rings containing selenium are more easily delocalized than those containing sulfur atoms. 15,22,23 Moreover , the absorption spectra of the DPPcontaining polymers ( P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP ) were redshifted by over 130 nm compared with the spectra of the Qxcontaining polymers ( P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ ) , suggesting the presence of stronger π-π interchain associations and aggregation in the solid state. Such aggregation is beneficial for improving charge mobility in thin films. The optical bandgaps of the polymer thin films were determined from the UV - vis absorption onsets in the solid state ( E g = 1240 / λ onset eV ). The optical bandgaps ( E g ) in the thin films were 1.70 , 1.63 , 1.27 , and 1.25 eV for P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP , respectively ; these values were significantly lower than those found for poly(3,3-dialkylterthioophene) ( PTT , 2.1 eV ) and poly(3,3-dialkylterselenophene) ( PSSS , 1.8 eV ). This successful reduction in the bandgap was mainly due to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) effects between the terthiophene donor or terselenophene donors and the Qx or DPP acceptor groups. The DPP moiety was a stronger acceptor than Qx , which led to a smaller E g for P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP than for P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ. The low bandgaps of P3TDTDPP ( 1.27 eV ) and P3SDTDPP ( 1.25 eV ) may have resulted from the planarity and high degree of conjugation in the DPP acceptor , which would enhance the π-π interactions and ICT among the polymer main chains. 24-26 Moreover , the optical bandgaps of the P3S - based polymer thin films were smaller than those of the P3T - based polymers because of the electron - rich selenium atoms in the core repeat units. The significant broadening in the absorption spectra of P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP ( relative to P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ ) may have indicated better ordering of the molecules in the bulk phase , which was manifested in the behavior of the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ).",

The HOMO levels of the polymer films were estimated from the cyclic voltammograms , using the equation E HOMO = -(E ox + 4.8 ) eV , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential relative to the ferrocene standard material. 27 The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy levels of P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP were calculated to be -5.37 , -5.35 , -5.21 , and -5.16 eV , respectively , using the ferrocene reference value of -4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The LUMO levels of P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP were calculated to be -3.67 , -3.72 , -3.94 , and -3.91 eV , respectively , as estimated from the optical bandgaps and HOMO energy levels. The deep HOMO levels may have contributed to the improved oxidative stability and higher open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) compared with those of PTT ( -5.2 eV ) and PSSS ( -4.9 eV ). 16 The above results indicated that the bandgap and molecular energy levels of P3T-or P3S - based polymers could be efficiently tuned by incorporating appropriate electron - withdrawing Qx and DPP groups. The electrochemical potentials are summarized in Table 2. Field - Effect Transistor Characteristics. The effects of the shape and position of the side chains on the electrical transport properties of the resulting polymers were examined by measuring the field - effect transistor ( FET ) mobility. The field - effect carrier mobilities of the polymers were investigated by fabricating thin - film transistors with a bottom - contact geometry , using Au electrodes. The FET characteristics were determined under ambient conditions , and no precautions were taken to insulate the materials and devices from exposure to air , moisture , or light.

    "sentence": "The hole mobility values for the P3S - based polymers were ∼ 1.5 times higher than those for the P3T - based polymers. The hole mobilities of the DPP - containing polymers ( P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP ) were 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of the Qx - containing polymers ( P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ ). The higher mobilities measured for P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP can be understood in terms of an improved intermolecular π-π stacking , which corresponds well with the UV - vis results. In addition , P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP yielded higher hole mobilities than P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ ; this was attributed to the more efficient charge extraction in the P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP solar cell devices ( Table 3 ). Organic Photovoltaic Characteristics. Polymer solar cell devices were fabricated using the P3T-and P3S - based polymers as electron donors and [6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) as an electron acceptor. The device structure was ITO / PEDOT : PSS(50 nm ) / polymer : PC61BM / LiF(0.6 nm ) / Al(130 nm ). The photovoltaic performances of the polymer : PC61BM devices are summarized in Table 3 and Figure 4. The PCEs varied considerably with the polymer : PCBM blend ratio used in the devices ; the details of the variation depended on the polymer backbone. Thus , the PCE of the Qx - containing polymer devices was higher for a blend ratio of 1 : 3 than 1 : 1 , while for DPP - containing polymer devices , the PCE was better with a 1 : 1 blend ratio than with a ratio of 1 : 3. The PCEs of the P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP devices were found to be 0.30% , 0.52% , 1.88% , and 1.85% , respectively. The open - circuit voltages ( V OC , which is related to the difference between the HOMO level of the donor polymer and the LUMO level of the acceptor ( PC61BM ) ) of the P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP devices were found to be 0.68 , 0.67 , 0.56 , and 0.50 V , respectively , for a blend ratio of 1 : 1. The high V OC values for the P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ devices could be explained by the low HOMO energy levels of P3TDTQ ( -5.37 eV ) and P3SDTQ ( -5.35 eV ) compared with those of P3TDTDPP ( -5.21 eV ) and P3SDTDPP ( -5.16 eV ). Among the devices using the P3T-and P3S - based polymers , the P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP devices demonstrated better photovoltaic performances than did those using P3TDTQ and P3SDTQ because the photon absorption fraction and the FET mobility were higher in the DPP - containing polymer films than in those containing Qx. The DPP - containing polymer devices therefore exhibited a high short circuit current density ( J SC ).",

    "sentence": "In the case of the Qxcontaining polymer devices , the P3S-Qx devices showed higher PCE values than their thiophene analogues ; however , the PCEs of the P3S-DPP devices were slightly lower than those of the P3T-DPP devices. The PCEs of the P3T-and P3S - based devices were heavily dependent on the electron - withdrawing accepting units. Interestingly , regardless of the PCE values of the devices , the P3S - based devices ( Qx and DPP ) always showed higher J SC values than the corresponding thiophene analogues ( for the same PCBM blend ratio ). The increased short circuit currents of the P3S - based devices could be attributed to the increased spectral breadth of the absorbed photons and hole mobilities. To better understand the origin of the differences in the photovoltaic performances of the polymer solar cells , AFM images of the surface morphologies of each solar cell device were collected ( Figure S2 , Supporting Information ). Generally , nanoscale phase separation should be established to allow efficient charge separation ; this is true due to the short exciton diffusion length ( ∼ 10 μm ) of the donor polymers. 29 As can be seen in Figure S2 , the P3TDTDPP : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) and P3SDTDPP : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) films showed a smoother and more interconnected network of polymer - PCBM domains , which accounted for the high photocurrent density in these films. In contrast , relatively high levels of aggregation were observed in the P3TDTQ : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) and P3SDTQ : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) films , which reduced the area for charge separation , leading to a low photocurrent. There were no significant differences between the morphologies of the P3T - based films and those of the P3S - based films. The performances of the solar cells based on P3TDTDPP : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) and P3SDTDPP : PCBM ( 1 : 1 ) films were further enhanced via the use of [6,6]-phenyl C 71butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as an electron acceptor and the use of a mixed chlorobenzene ( CB ) / 1,8-diiodoctane ( DIO ) ( 97% : 3% by volume ) solvent. Figure 5 shows the current- voltage characteristics resulting from the use of the PC71BM and the mixed solvent in the polymer solar cell devices ; the data are summarized in Table 4. The P3TDTDPP:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 ) and P3SDTDPP:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 ) devices showed PCE values similar to those shown by the corresponding PC61BM devices. In contrast , dramatic improvements were observed in the J SC and PCE values for the 3% DIO-containing devices. The PCE increased from 1.88% to 3.18% for the P3TDTDPP:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 ) device and from 1.85% to 2.81% for the P3SDTDPP:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 ) device.",

The improvement in the OPV performances was caused by the changes in the morphology of the blend film. AFM images ( Figure . 6 ) clearly showed that there were large domains in the blend film prepared using only chlorobenzene ; these large domains would diminish exciton migration to the donor / acceptor interface and are not favorable for charge separation. The morphology of the blend film prepared using the chlorobenzene / DIO mixed solvent was much more uniform , with no significant phase separation. Good miscibility between the donor polymer and the PC71BM was shown , and interpenetrating networks were formed ; these factors may have led to increases in the J SC value. EQE values ( which were measured to evaluate the photoresponses of the fabricated solar cells as a function of w a v e l e n g t h ) a r e s h o w n i n F i g u r e 5 b f o r t h e P3TDTDPP:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 ) and P3SDTDPP:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 ) devices prepared with 3% DIO. The P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP devices yielded an EQE plot that was similar to the absorption spectra of P3TDTDPP and P3SDTDPP in the long wavelength region , indicating that excitons were mainly generated in the polymer phase. The spectral responses of the P3TDTDPP device showed that in the region from 350 to 950 nm photons contributed significantly to the EQE , with a maximum EQE of 35% at 550 nm. The P3SDTDPP device , however , exhibited an even better spectral response in the range 350-1000 nm , with a maximum EQE of 38% at 550 nm. The P3SDTDPP:PC71BM blend film exhibited a wide absorption spectrum ( 650-1000 nm ) , which resulted in a much higher J SC of 12.33 mA / cm^2 . In summary , we successfully synthesized novel thiophene-and selenophene - based low - bandgap polymers , using the Stille coupling reaction. The P3TDTQ P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP polymers showed good solubility in common organic solvents because of the presence of alkyl side chains. P3TDTQ , P3SDTQ , P3TDTDPP , and P3SDTDPP exhibited long - wavelength UV - vis absorption peaks at 587 , 619 , 716 , and 753 nm , respectively.",

    "sentence": "Bandgap and molecular energy level control are of great importance in improving photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers. A common approach to tuning these parameters is to modify the structure of conjugated polymers by copolymerizing with different units. In this paper , research work focuses on the synthesis of benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) with different conjugated units and their photovoltaic performance. Eight new BDT - based polymers with commonly used conjugated units , including thiophene , benzo [c][1,2,5]thiadiazole ( BT ) , thieno [3,4-b]pyrazine ( TPZ ) , etc. , were synthesized. The bandgaps of the polymers were tuned in the range of 1.0 - 2.0 eV , and their HOMO and LUMO energy levels could also be tuned effectively. The absorption spectra as well as electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these polymers were investigated systematically. Some units exhibiting the same effect of bandgap lowering exhibited different effects on molecular energy levels of the polymers. For example , the TPZ unit can reduce the bandgap by lowering the LUMO energy level and elevating the HOMO level of the polymer , but the BT unit can lower the bandgap only by depressing the LUMO level. Since open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the heterojunction polymer solar cell is believed to be inversely proportional to the HOMO level of electron donor material , V oc of the devices based on H9 , the copolymer of BDT and TPZ , was ca. 0.5 V lower than that of the device based on H7 , the copolymer of BDT and BT. The effects of seven commonly used units on bandgap , molecular energy level , and photovoltaic properties of the BDT based polymers are studied and discussed in this paper , which can provide a guideline not only for design of photovoltaic materials but also for materials of various other electronic devices. In addition , the PCE of the device based on PCBM and H6 , one of the BDT - based polymers , reached 1.6% , and V oc , I sc , and FF of the device were 0.75 V , 3.8 mA / cm^2 , and 56% , respectively , which indicates that BDT is a promising common unit for photovoltaic conjugated polymers. Since we have developed the synthetic method of the 4,8-bisalkoxy-BDT monomer , the BDT unit will play an important role in future research on conjugated polymer design . Conjugated polymers have attracted considerable attention due to their versatile applications in the fields of conducting polymers and conjugated polymer optoelectronic devices.

    "sentence": "6 For conjugated polymers used in PSC devices , bandgap and molecular energy levels are of crucial importance for device performance. The mismatch between absorption spectra of conjugated polymers and the solar irradiance spectrum is one of the main reasons for low efficiency of PSC devices. As shown in Figure 1 , the spectrum of photon flux of sunlight exhibits a broadband in the range from 350 to 3000 nm with a peak at about 680 nm. However , the active layer of PSC devices can absorb only a small portion of sunlight. In fact , the absorption spectrum of poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , a widely used photovoltaic material , only covers the range of 300-650 nm. 7 In order to improve light harvesting by PSCs , some small - bandgap polymers were introduced into PSCs. 8 For example , poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′] dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) ] ( PCPDTBT ) provides a better overlap with the solar spectrum than P3HT and was successfully used in application of PSC. 9 However , the molecular energy levels of the materials were not ideal yet , in that a great deal of energy of absorbed photons was lost during the photon - electron conversion process , which is another important reason for low efficiency of PSC devices. As shown in Figure 1 , the energy of photons absorbed by active layer materials is more than 1.5 eV , but V oc of the devices is only around 0.6 V. For PCPDTBTbased solar cells , more than 60% of the energy of absorbed photons is lost during the photon - electron conversion process ; for P3HT - based solar cells , this kind of energy loss can get to more than 75% . As reported , V oc of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell varies directly with the gap between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit ( LUMO ) level of electron acceptor material and the highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) level of electron donor material. 10 Therefore , to pursue higher V oc , the electron donor material with a deeper HOMO level or electron acceptor material with a higher LUMO level should be employed in polymer solar cells. HOMO and LUMO energy levels of conjugated polymers as well as their bandgaps are tunable by copolymerizing with different units. For example , the bandgap of poly(3-alkylthiophene) can be lowered from 1.85 to 1.55 eV after substituting with alkoxy groups at the 3-position. Correspondingly its HOMO level is elevated from -4.75 to -4.47 eV as a result of which V oc of the PSC devices dropped from 0.6 V ( for poly(3alkylthiophene - based device ) to 0.02 V ( for poly(3-alkoxythiophene) - based device ). 11 The polymer of 4,4-dioctylcyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene exhibited a bandgap of 1.8 eV and a HOMO level of -5.15 eV , 12 and after being copolymerized with 4,7-diylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole , the band gap of the polymer was lowered to 1.4 eV , but its HOMO level had little change.",

These results reveal that it is necessary to investigate effects of copolymerized functional units on bandgap and molecular energy levels of conjugated polymers. In this paper , effects of seven different but commonly used units on bandgap and molecular energy levels of conjugated polymers were investigated systematically , and these results provide some useful reference to control bandgap and molecular energy levels of conjugated polymers. Additionally , a family of conjugated polymer photovoltaic materials was designed , synthesized , and characterized systematically. Furthermore , the photovoltaic properties of the new polymers were also investigated by fabricating the PSC devices . All of these BDT - based polymers exhibited very similar thermal stability , and Figure 2 shows the thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) plots of H6 and H7 as representative samples. The onset decomposition temperatures of the polymers are around 270 °C without protection of inert gas , due to leaving of alkoxy groups. Obviously , the thermal stability of the BDTbased polymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was performed to determine the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers. 18 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the BDT - based polymer films on Pt electrode in 0.1 mol / L Bu 4 NPF 6 , CH 3 CN solution. From the value of onset oxidation potential ( ox ) and onset reduction potential ( red ) of the polymers , the HOMO and the LUMO as well as the bandgaps ( E g ec ) were calculated and listed in Table 1 .

Structure of BDT - Based Polymers rich units , ethylene , thiophene , and ethylenedioxythiophene ( EDOT ) , affect bandgap of BDT polymer slightly. In films , the peak of absorption spectrum of the homopolymer of BDT , H2 , is at about 495 nm. In comparison with H2 , absorption spectra of H3 and H6 show a red shift by 10 nm , and the absorption spectrum of the polymer H8 shifts to the red direction by about 40 nm because of the strong electron - donating effect of EDOT. However , the four electron - deficient units exhibit a strong effect in lowering the bandgap of the BDT - based polymers. The order of bandgap - lowering ability of these four units was thieno [ 3,4- b]pyrazine ( TPZ ) .",

Although TPZ and BT have the same molecular formula and similar structure , TPZ affects the absorption spectrum of the BDT - based polymer much more distinctly than BT. As shown in Figure 4 , the absorption spectrum of H7 exhibits a peak at 591 nm and an absorption edge at 730 nm corresponding to a bandgap of 1.7 eV. In comparison with H7 , the absorption spectrum of H9 shifts toward a longer wavelength by about 240 nm. The main reason for the difference between their absorption spectra is attributed to the different stabilities of their electron quinoid forms. Both TPZ and BT are fused aromatic heterocyclic compounds constituted of a six - member ring and a five - member ring. However , as shown in Scheme 3 , TPZ is linked with adjacent aromatic units at the 5 and 7 positions on the fivemember ring , but BT is linked with adjacent aromatic units at the 4 and 7 positions on the six - member ring. In the quinoid structure of TPZ , the six - member ring can form a more stable aromatic electron structure , whereas the electron structure of the five - member ring of BT has no change in its aromatic and quinoid structures. So , the six - member ring of TPZ will stabilize the quinoid structure better than the five - member ring of BT , and thus a more stable quinoid structure will be formed in polymer H9 than in H7. Since the quinoid form has a smaller bandgap than the aromatic form , 19 the bandgap of H9 is lower than H7 . Figure 5 shows the I-V curves of the PSC devices with champion performances under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2 , and Table 2 lists the photovoltaic properties obtained from the I-V curves. Polymer H2 exhibited good solubility in toluene and chlorobenzene above 80 °C but can not be dissolved in cold solvent. So , a uniform film can not be prepared for solar cell device , and photovoltaic properties of H2 are not presented in this paper. As listed in Table 2 , the photovoltaic properties of these materials are different from each other. For example , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of H6 - based device is more than 10 times higher than that of H9. As known , the short circuit current ( I sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) are very susceptible to molecular structure of the polymers. For instance , the number of carbons in the alkyl side chain of polythiophene can greatly affect the hole mobility of poly(3-alkylthiophene) 20 as well as its photovoltaic properties , 21 and under same conditions , the PCE of poly(3-hexylthiophene) : PCBM - based device is about 10 times higher than that of poly(3butylthiophene) : PCBM - based device.",

In order to reveal the relationship between HOMO level of electron donor material and V oc of the device , the variation of V oc of the devices based on BDT polymers as a function of HOMO level is shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that , in general , V oc of the devices varies inversely with HOMO level of the electron donor material. As listed in Table 1 , the onset points of oxidation and reduction of H2 are 0.44 V ( E ox ) and -2.05 V ( E red ) , corresponding to a HOMO level of -5.16 eV and a LUMO level of -2.67 eV. Polymer H8 has a similar E red potential as H6 , but E ox of H8 is 0.49 V higher than that of H6 , which is due to the strong electron - pushing effect of the 3,4ethylenedioxythiophene units. As a result , V oc of H6 - based device was 0.38 V higher than the H8 - based device , which indicates that insertion of electron - donating functional groups for lowering bandgap is not a feasible method in terms of photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers. The four electron - deficient units also exhibited different effects on molecular energy levels of the BDT - based polymers. E g of the polymer H9 reached 1.05 eV , which is the smallest among these polymers , and its absorption spectrum matched the spectrum of solar irradiation very well. However , V oc of the H9 - based device is only 0.21 V because the HOMO level of H9 is too high. The BT unit has little influence on the HOMO level of the BDT - based polymer , and the HOMO of H7 is similar to that of H2. The LUMO level of H7 is lower than H2 by about 0.52 eV , which indicates that the BT unit can the lower bandgap by depressing the LUMO level only. As a result , V oc of H7based devices was 0.68 V , which is much higher than that of H9. The BSe unit , the analogue of BT , exhibited more effect on depressing the LUMO level of BDT - based polymer , but it also exhibited a small effect on elevating the HOMO level. The LUMO level of H11 is higher than H7 by 0.12 eV , and the LUMO level of H11 is lower than H7 by 0.14 eV.

We are working on investigating the relationship between morphology of active layers and performance of the BDT polymer - based devices and will report in the near future. Since the polymer H9 exhibits a broad absorption spectrum extending to 1000 nm , we measured the input photon to converted current efficiency ( IPCE ) curve to investigate the response range of the material. As shown in Figure 7 , the shape of the IPCE curve of the device based on H9 is very similar to its absorption spectrum , indicating that all the absorption of the polymer contributed to the photovoltaic conversion . In this paper , eight BDT - based conjugated polymers ( see Scheme 1 ) were designed and synthesized , and seven commonly used aromatic units were used to tailor the bandgap of the polymers as well as molecular energy levels. By copolymerizing with different units , bandgaps and molecular energy levels of the polymers can be tuned effectively. The effects of these units on bandgaps and molecular energy levels were investigated systematically by absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltam - metry methods. The PSC devices based on the polymers were fabricated and characterized. We found that the V oc of the devices varied inversely with the HOMO level of the electron donor materials , and some units such as ethylenedioxythiophene and TPZ can not be used as bandgap - lowering units in BDT polymers due to the fact that HOMO levels of the polymers were elevated too much after being copolymerized with these units. However , the BT unit can lower the bandgap by reducing the LUMO level only , and the BSe unit exhibits similar properties as BT. So , for optimization of bandgaps and molecular energy levels of BDT - based polymers , BT and BSe are preferable to TPZ and BPQ. These results provide some good reference to bandgap and molecular energy level control of BDT - based polymers and should also be useful for molecular structure design of other kinds of conjugated polymers serving in various electronic devices. Although photovoltaic performance of the devices based on the new materials was lower than the device based on classic materials such as P3HT , the device based on H6 : PCBM exhibited promising photovoltaic properties without any posttreatment. V oc , I sc , and FF of the H6 - based device were 0.75 V , 3.8 mA / cm^2 , and 56% , respectively , corresponding to a PCE of 1.6% , which indicates BDT is a promising common unit of photovoltaic conjugated polymers.",

In this work , a new medium bandgap conjugated D-A copolymer , HFAQx-T , based on 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT-T ) as donor unit , 4-alkyl-3,5-difluorophenyl substituted quinoxaline ( HFAQx ) as the acceptor unit , and thiophene as the spacer , was designed and synthesized. HFAQx-T is a well - compatible donor polymer ; OSCs based on HFAQx-T exhibit excellent performance in both fullerene and fullerene - free based devices. The optimized conventional single junction bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) OSCs of HFAQx-T:PC71BM showed a PCE of 9.2% , with an open circut voltage ( V oc ) of 0.9 V , a short circuit current ( J sc ) of 14.0 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 0.74.

This work demonstrates that the 4-alkyl-3,5-difluorophenyl substituted quinoxaline ( Qx ) is a promising electron - accepting building block in constructing ideal D-A copolymers for OSCs . Solution - processed organic solar cells ( OSCs ) with bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) architecture , based on the blend of a conjugated polymer ( p - type organic semiconductor , p-OS ) donor and a n - type organic semiconductor ( n-OS ) acceptor , have been intensively investigated in recent years due to their advantages of light weight , mechanical flexibility , and roll - to - roll solution processability. 1-4 In the past few years , rapid and significant progress has been made , and the power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) over 10% have been realized. 5-8 The application of fullerenes and their derivatives ( e.g. , [6,6]phenyl-C 61 / C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM / PC71BM ) ) as electron acceptors has greatly contributed to the advancement of the OSC field owing to their high electron mobility even in blended films , isotropic electron transporting properties , and formation of appropriate phase separation with donor materials. 9-11 However , fullerene materials have some inherent limitations , such as weak absorption in visible and near - infrared ( NIR ) region , high production costs , and poor morphology stability , which is a bottleneck to the development of fullerene solar cells.",

    "sentence": "12,13 Thus , to address these problems and to further promote the development of OSCs , considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of fullerene - free acceptors ; recently , fullerenefree acceptors have made big progress , especially small - molecular acceptors ( such as ITIC , 14 IEIC , 15 IDIC , 16 etc. ) are successfully designed and synthesized toward fullerene free solar cells because of strong and broad light absoption , easily tunable energy levels , and better morphology stability. The most representative fullerene - free acceptors are low bandgap n-OS , for instance , ITIC. This fused ring - based \" push - pull \" structured acceptor ITIC exhibits good miscibility with polymer donors , strong absorption in the wavelength range of 600-800 nm , and suitable energy levels. 14 To date , some highly efficient fullenrene - free devices based on ITIC and derivatives were fabricated ; the performances of 10-13 % with single - junction structure have been realized by using medium bandgap conjugated polymer materials. 17-22 Further improvement of PCE is still required for commercialization. In order to obtain high efficiency OSCs , it is necessary not only to design high - performance acceptors but also to develop matched polymer donors. In principle , the donor material should possess the following features : ( i ) the absorption spectra of donor and non-fullerene acceptor should be complementary that results in high incident photon - to - electron conversion efficiency ( IPCE ) values in the 400-600 nm region and the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) ; ( ii ) the energy levels of the donor should be appropriate for keeping efficient charge separation with low energy loss and high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) ; ( iii ) the selection of donor should have morphology compatibility with the acceptor to form nanoscale phase separation , bicontinuous interpenetrating networks , and high fill factor ( FF ). 23-25 A conjugated polymer can be divided into two constituting parts : ( a ) π-conjugated backbones and ( b ) peripheral flexible solubilizing side chains. 26 The development of novel π-conjugated backbones has always been the central issue in this field due to π-conjugated backbones which determine the optoelectronic properties of the polymers. It is also wellestablished that side - chain engineering has played crucial role in key properties of conjugated polymers , such as molecular weight , absorption , emission , inter-and intramolecular interactions , charge transport , and active layer morphology. 27,28 Selecting appropriate side chain is as important as selecting conjugated backbones. Currently , the development of conjugated polymers with donor - acceptor ( D-A ) alternating molecular structure is a successful and universal strategy for preparing high efficiency donor materials , which can tune molecular energy levels , optical absorption properties , and carrier mobility by selecting different donor or acceptor units.",

    "sentence": "29,30 Therefore , the design of new donor and acceptor building motifs has always been one of the most important researches to construct D-A copolymers for high efficiency OSCs. Until now , a large number of D-A copolymers have been developed and shown good photovoltaic properties with PCEs as high as 10% in single - junction OSCs. 31-33 This indicates that the development of novel conjugated polymers will certainly play a pivotal role in driving this research. Among the huge variety of D-A polymers for optoelectronic applications , a series of polymers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) unit and quinoxaline ( Qx ) unit were synthesized. Indeed , similarly to BDT , Qx is a popular and promising building block. 34-36 It has already been widely utilized in industry to inhibit metal corrosion , in pharmacology against bacteria , malaria , and cancer , etc. , 37,38 and also BHJ solar cells. 39,40 The two nitrogen atoms at the 1,4-positions make the quinoxaline unit as an electron - deficient building block. Futhermore , the Qx motif can provide the versatility of introducing different substituents easily on the 2-and 3-positions , which could be used to tune the solubility , bandgap , and energy levels of the resulting polymers ( see Scheme 1 ). Some Qx - based conjugated polymers have been described previously with PCE increasing from 0.3% 41 to 11.47% . 42 Recently , intensive researches have been devoted to exploring fluorination in conjugated polymers for solar cells since it has a relatively small van der Waals radius of 147 pm , which can minimize the undesired steric interactions. Meanwhile , the introduction of fluorine onto backbone of conjugated polymer has been proven to be an effective method to reduce HOMO and LUMO levels due to the most electronegative element of the fluorine atom with a Pauling electronegativity of 4.0. In addition , noncovalent interactions exist for fluorine , such as F°°°H , F°°°S , and F°°°π , resulting in a better charge mobility of the polymers. 43-45 Our group first introduced six fluorine atoms on the Qx unit and obtain an ideal acceptor unit HFQx. 46 Therefore , developing new methods to utilizing the fluorination more effectively is of great importance to design conjugated polymer for photovoltaic applications. Motivated by the above-mentioned considerations , in this work , we reported a new D-A copolymer by using 4,8-bis(5-(2ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT-T ) as electron donor unit , 5,8-dibromo-2,3-bis(4-(2ethylhexyl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline as the acceptor unit , and thiophene as the spacer , namely , poly{5-(5-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,3-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)-6,7-difluoro-8-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-quinoxaline} ( HFAQx-T ) , which was synthesized and used as donor material for OSCs. The 4-alkyl-3,5-difluorophenyl group was first introduced as the lateral side chain to Qx unit ( HFAQx ). Interestingly , HFAQx-T is a typical medium bandgap donor material due to the weak electron donating ability of the 4-alkyl-3,5-difluorophenyl 47 substituted Qx unit. The photovoltaic performance of the p - type polymer was investigated by fabricating fullerene - free OSCs with the HFAQx-T as donor and narrow bandgap n - type ITIC as acceptor.",

Single - junction OSCs based on HFAQx-T as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor have also been fabricated. A PCE of 3.49% without any solvent additives and postannealing treatments.

More importantly , HFAQx-T is among a few D-A copolymers that can deliver > 9% efficiency in both fullerene and fullerene - free solar cells. 32 The results indicated that this novel donor polymer HFAQx-T is a well - compatible donor material and probably work as another platform with various small molecular acceptor materials to achieve high performance OSCs . Synthesis of the Polymer. As outlined in Scheme 2 , the polymer HFAQx-T was synthesized via a typical Stille polymerization using toluene as solvent and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium ( 0 ) [ Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 ] as catalyst. The detailed synthetic procedures are described in the Supporting Information. The polymer HFAQx-T was carefully purified by S4 ) , evaluated by hightemperature gel permeation chromatography ( HT - GPC ) at 150 °C using 1,2,4-tricholorobenzene as the eluent and monodispersed polystyrene as the standard. The thermal property of the polymer was determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ). As shown in Figure S5a , the TGA results reveal that the onset temperature with 5% weight loss ( T d ) for HFAQx-T is 388 °C ; this value indicates that the thermal stability of the HFAQx-T is suitable for OSCs. Figure 1a presents the molecular structures of materials employed in this work. HFAQx-T was used as a donor material.

The maximum absorption peak for HFAQx-T in chloroform and film states is located at 618 and 635 nm , respectively. Compared with the solution , the 17 nm red - shift in the film state indicates that there is some aggregation of HFAQx-T backbone and π-π intermolecular interaction in the solid film state.",

Moreover , at the short wavelength range ( 300-500 nm ) , HFAQx-T showed distinct peaks. The maximum absorption coefficient of pure HFAQx-T film ( α film = 5.2 × 10^4 cm^-1 ) was measured as shown in Figure S5b and listed in Table 1. We also measured the absorption spectra of the blend films of the HFAQx-T:PC71BM and HFAQx - T : ITIC , as illustrated in Figure S5c,d. The blend film of HFAQx - T : ITIC provides a better complementary absorption range from 500 to 750 nm with thermal annealing , in comparison with that of the blend film of HFAQx-T:PC71BM. This strong and broad absorption of the blend film of HFAQx - T : ITIC will benefit the J sc enhancement of OSCs based on HFAQx - T : ITIC. The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) levels of HFAQx-T can be determined by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). The CV curve is shown in Figure 1c , and the electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. The onset potentials for oxidation ( E ox ) and reduction ( E red ) are 1.09 and -0.97 V , respectively. The HOMO level and the LUMO level of HFAQx-T were caculated according to the equations HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.41 ) ( eV ) and LUMO = -e(E red + 4.41 ) ( eV ) , respectively , 48 corresponding to a HOMO level of -5.50 eV and a LUMO level of -3.44 eV , respectively. Obviously , HFAQx-T prensents a similar E HOMO value and larger E LUMO value than the previous analogue of HFQx-T ; 46 that is , grafting two alkyl side chains at the phenyl have little influence on the HOMO energy level , but they can cause a higher LUMO level for HFAQx-T. The electrochemical bandgap ( E g ec ) of the HFAQx-T calculated from the difference As is well - known , it is essential to match energy levels of donor and acceptor materials for high performance OSCs. The molecular energy level alignments in the two types of the blends are shown in Figure 1e. For the HFAQx-T:PC71BM system , the gaps of HOMO and LUMO are larger than 0.3 eV , which is 49,50 or perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide ( PDINO ) 51 / Al ( 100 nm ) were fabricated under the illumination of AM 1.5G ( 100 mW cm^-2 ) , where PEDOT : PSS is used as the hole transport layer ( HTL ) ; ZrAcac and PDINO are adopted as the cathode buffer layer for lowering the work function of Al.

    "sentence": "The typical current density versus voltage ( J-V ) characteristic curves and corresponding external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra for the solar cells are shown in Figure 2a,b. The photovoltaic data are listed in Table 2 and Table S1. For HFAQx-T:PC71BM solar cells , the best devices gave a PCE of 9.2% , with a V oc of 0.90 V , a J sc of 14.0 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 0.74. These devices have a D / A ratio of 1 : 1.2 ( w / w ) , an active layer thickness of 95 nm , and 0.25% DIO ( v / v ) as the additive ( see Table S1 ). The PCE of 9.2% is the highest efficiency reported in the literature to date for Qx - based polymer / fullerene OSCs , which might be due to the good light - harvesting capability of HFAQx-T and the ideal phase separation in the active layer. DIO was found very crucial in improving the performance of HFAQx-T:PC71BM devices. The devices without DIO gave a poor PCE of 3.5% , with reduced J sc and FF of 8.9 mA cm^-2 and 0.43 , respectively. After adding 0.25% ( v / v ) DIO , the EQE maximum increased from 49.9% to 74.2% at 500 nm , accounting for the enhancement of J sc . Highly efficient photovoltaic performance is achieved when ITIC is used as acceptor material. For these fullerene - free based OSCs , the as-cast device of HFAQx - T : ITIC ( 0.8 : 1.0 , w / w ) exhibited a PCE of 8.8% , while it was distinctly enhanced to 9.6% efficiency after annealing at 130 °C for 10 min , with a V oc of 0.94 V , a J sc of 15.4 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 0.66. Compared to the as-cast devices , the increased PCE of the devices with thermal annealing treatment is largely a result of the increased J sc and FF. Furthermore , compared with PC71BM devices , ITIC based devices gave a higher V oc and J sc , which is due to the enlarged energy gap between donor 's HOMO and acceptor 's LUMO and the increased absorption in the NIR region , respectively. According to the EQE curves , the calculated J sc values of the devices agree well with J sc from J-V measurements within 5% mismatch , indicating that our photovoltaic results are reliable. The series resistance ( R s ) and shunt resistance ( R sh ) of OSCs are measured to elucidate the effects of additive and thermal annealing from their respective J-V curves under illumination. As shown in Table 2 , the optimized fullerene - and fullerene - free based devices present a relatively lower R s and higher R sh in comparison to their corresponding as-cast devices , suggesting better overall diode characteristics after the optimization process.",

    "sentence": "However , good α values of 0.97 and 0.99 were obtained for optimized fullerene - and fullerene - freebased devices ; the results showed that bimolecular recombination was more suppressed after optimization and should make a great contribution to the enhanced FF and J sc . Moreover , we investigated the process of exciton generation , exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency of the BHJ OSCs by measuring the photocurrent density ( J ph ) versus the effective voltage ( V eff ) curves. V eff can be described as V eff = V 0 - V bias , where V 0 is the voltage when J ph = 0 and V bias is the applied external voltage bias. J ph can be described as J ph = J L - J D , where J L and J D are the current densities under illumination and in the dark , respectively. Figure 2d shows a log - log plot of J ph versus V eff for HFAQx - T : acceptor blend films. As shown in Figure 2d , J ph reaches saturation ( J sat ) at V eff ≥ 2 V , indicating that almost all of the photogenerated free carriers in the devices can be collected by electrodes. The charge collection probability at short - circuit condition can be calculated from J ph / J sat . The J ph / J sat value for the optimized devices of HFAQx-T:PC71BM and HFAQx - T : ITIC is 92.4% and 90.0% , respectively , implying that both optimized fullerene - and fullerene - free OSCs based on HFAQx-T have highly efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection. Morphology Investigation. The morphology of the active layer has a significant influence on photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Here , we studied the morphologies of the blend films by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( Figure 3a-d ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( Figure 3e-h ). For the HFAQx-T:PC71BM blend film , the AFM image exhibits a relatively serious self - aggregation with a large root-mean-square ( RMS ) value of 5.12 nm which would limit the probability for exciton dissociation and suffer serious trap - assisted recombination consistent with the charge separation and recombination studies ( Figure 3a ). The corresponding TEM image shows high phase separation and severe aggregation ( Figure 3e ) , which may be attributed to the poor miscibility of HFAQx-T with PC71BM. However , a smooth surface morphology was observed ( RMS = 1.57 nm ) after optimizing by 0.25 vol % DIO additive treatment ( Figure 3b ) , which would be favorable to get more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport for OSCs , and thus higher FF and PCE can be achieved , while HFAQx - T : ITIC film with thermal annealing became rougher , with RMS roughness increasing from 0.97 to 1.04 nm ( Figure 3c,d ) , indicating that slightly enhanced aggregation which would be benefit the charge transport.",

    "sentence": "As shown in Figure 3g,h , TEM images from the blend films exhibited a similar tendency with AFM studies to develop more uniform and well - distributed interpenetrating nanoscale networks after thermal annealing. We also carried out grazing - incidence wide - and small - angle Xray scattering ( GIWAXS / GISAXS ) on pure HFAQx-T film and blend films with different acceptors for a better understanding on the bulk morphology. 54 Two - dimensional ( 2D ) GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding intensity profiles in the out - ofplane and in-plane directions are presented in Figures S8 and S9. HFAQx-T in the pure film ( Figure S8a ) is preferentially face-on oriented with the lamella peak concentrated along the q x axis ( q = 0.30 Å -1 ; d = 20.9 Å ) and the π-π peak concentrated along the q z axis ( q = 1.74 Å -1 ; d = 3.61 Å ). The favorable face-on ordering of the HFAQx-T crystalline domains is preserved in the blended films of HFAQx - T : ITIC as the π-π peak can still be observed along the q z axis ( Figure S8f,g ). In contrast , the blended films of HFAQx - T : PCBM exhibit relatively isotropic molecular packing , evident by the ringlike scattering features. 2D GISAXS patterns and the corresponding horizontal intensity profiles are shown in Figure 4a-e and Figure S10 to estimate the sizes of each phase. Here , the scattering contribution from pure HFAQx-T or ITIC phases is fitted by the fractal - like network model , 6 whereas the pure PC71BM phases are modeled as poly dispersed hard spheres. 55 The Debye-Anderson-Brumberger ( DAB ) model is used to account for the scattering due to amorphous intermixing region. The scattering of the as-cast HFAQx-T:PC71BM blend film presents a clear shoulder at q ∼ 0.004 Å -1 , indicating the formation of excessively large PC71BM domains ( R g = 67.3 nm ) , which is detrimental to the device performance. With the DIO treatment , the PC71BM domain size shrinks to a reasonable value of R g = 19.0 nm , in agreement with the observed improvement in device performance. The GISAXS profiles of blended HFAQx - T : ITIC with or without thermal annealing are very similar : the estimated domain sizes of the intermixing region , pure ITIC , and pure HFAQx-T phases are 44.1 , 4.52 , and 43.7 nm for the as-cast film and 32.7 , 5.55 , and 37.7 nm for the annealed film , consistent with the similar device performance with or without thermal annealing . In summary , a new medium bandgap Qx copolymer , HFAQx-T , was synthesized and used as the donor polymer in OSCs.",

When blended with ITIC , the HFAQx-T based device showed a PCE of 9.6% , attributing to the more complementary absorption and better energy level match of the HFAQx-T and ITIC. HFAQx-T is among a few D-A copolymers that can deliver > 9% efficiency in both fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells , which is inspiring for the design of new donors compatible with fullerene and fullerene - free acceptors. The results indicated that incorporation of two weak electrondonating alkyl side chain onto the 4-positions of the phenyl at the Qx unit by side - chain engineering would be a feasible approach to improve photovoltaic properties.
