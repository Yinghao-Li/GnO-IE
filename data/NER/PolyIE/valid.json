    "sentence": "We present controls of nanomorphology of polymer : fullerene BHJ films via synthesis of a series of push - pull - type copolymers with various molar percentages of side chains terminated with o-dichlorobenzyl ( DCBZ ) groups. As the molar percentage of the DCBZ-containing repeat units increases , the miscibility of the polymers in the series with PC71BM increases with respect to that of the polymer ( PTBBO ) that does not contain DCBZ. In the optimal film morphology , which consists of a polymer containing 25 mol % DCBZ-terminated side chains in the electron - pull unit ( PTBDCB25 ) , the polymer / PC71BM interface area is sufficiently large for efficient charge separation and percolated pathways is present for efficient charge carrier transport. In contrast , the BHJ film prepared from PTBBO has smaller interfaces and larger PC71BM aggregates. Furthermore , the intermolecular interaction between PC71BM and DCBZ induced changes in the PC71BM 's electronic structure at the polymer : PC71BM interface , resulting in an increase of the PC71BM 's LUMO level and thereby the improved open - circuit voltage. As a result , the BHJ solar cell device fabricated with PTBDCB25 exhibits significantly improved performance with a PCE of 8.30% , whereas the PCE of PTBBO is 6.90% . Nanomorphology controls of polymer : fullerene bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) films are of great importance for achieving high solar cell efficiencies in BHJ organic photovoltaics ( OPVs ) devices. 1-8 To maximize free charge carrier generation and collection , the polymer and fullerene materials should develop a nanostructure such that their interface area is maximized , while typical dimensions of phase separation are within the exciton diffusion range ( ∼ 10 nm ) and continuous pathways for charge carrier transport to the electrodes are ensured. 7,9-12 Additionally , it is required to form optimal polymer : fullerene nanostructures of the blend film in such a way to maximize open - circuit voltages ( V oc s ) because variations in the film morphology can modulate the device V oc . 13-15 To achieve high solar cell efficiencies , a thorough understanding of the relationship between the molecular structures of the polymer and the BHJ nanomorphology and the solar cell properties is necessary. In particular , it is important to identify a correspondence between polymer - fullerene interactions and photovoltaic properties at a molecular level. 16,17 One of challenging tasks in the morphology control is to design conjugated polymers with good compatibility with fullerene derivatives. Most attempts to improve the miscibility of the polymer with the fullerene derivatives have been limited to tuning the properties of the polymer through modifying alkyl side chains such as the alkyl chain length and the bridging point. 18-24 In some cases , fullerene molecules were found to intercalate between the neighbored polymer side chains and formed well intermixed morphology. 25,26 Morphology control at a nanoscale was performed by introducing various polymer end - cappers , which effectively change the surface energy of the polymer and thus the miscibility with fullerenes.",

    "sentence": "27 The miscibility of the molecules can be characterized in terms of the Hansen solubility parameters ( δ ) of the blend components ; materials with similar values of δ are likely to be mutually miscible via intermolecular interactions. 28-31 Therefore , to increase the miscibility of the polymer with fullerenes , it would be beneficial to introduce functional moieties with Hansen solubility parameters close to those of fullerene derivatives as side chains , such as the o-dichlorobenzyl group ( DCBZ ). 28 o-Dichlorobenzene ( ODCB ) is a good solvent for fullerene derivatives as well as conjugated polymers and has been used as a representative solvent for processing polymer BHJ films. In addition , dipole moments generated on the ODCB side chain terminal are expected to play favorably for better molecular packing of the polymer and thereby better charge carrier transport. Herein , we investigated morphological properties of polymer : fullerene BHJ films of push - pull - type random copolymers containing the DCBZ group at the ends of their alkyl side chains. In our study , we chose poly(thienothiopheneco-benzodithiophene) as the basic polymer backbone because it is a good low bandgap polymer for the BHJ solar cells. 32,33 Tuning the molar portion of the DCBZ functionalized side chain in the polymer effectively controlled the miscibility of the polymer and PC71BM and thus optimized the nanoscale phase separation in the polymer : PC71BM BHJ active layer , resulting in the improved short - circuit current ( J sc ). Moreover , the introduced DCBZ group was demonstrated to induce changes in the PC71BM 's electronic structure , which resulted in the increased lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of PC71BM at the interface of polymer / PC71BM and thereby the enhanced V oc of polymer BHJ solar cells. As a result , DCBZ-based polymer solar cells achieved a high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) up to 8.30% . We introduced the DCBZ group into the polymers via random copolymerization of 2-butyloctyl 4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno- [ 3,4- b]thiophene-2-carboxylate ( TT-BO ) , 4-(3,4- dichlorobenzyloxy)butyl 4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]- thiophene-2-carboxylate ( TT-DCBZ ) , and 2,6-bis-(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT-EH ). These monomers were synthesized by following modified literature procedures 21,34 and the polymerization was carried out via the Stille coupling polymerization 35 with the prepared monomers at feed ratios of TT-BO:TT-DCBZ = m : n ( mol : mol ) = 1 : 0 , 0.75 : 0.25 , 0.5 : 0.5 , and 0 : 1 to produce PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 , respectively ( Figure 1a ). The polymerized products were precipitated in methanol , and purified by performing successive Soxhlet extractions with methanol , hexane , and chloroform. The molecular weights of PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 were estimated with gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) at 80 °C and found to be M n = 69 , 70 , 65 , and 51 kg / mol with polydispersity indices ( PDI ) of 2.8 , 2.5 , 2.3 , and 2.5 , respectively.",

    "sentence": "The UV - vis absorption spectra of the polymers in a film are shown in Figure 1b and their characteristic data are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectrum is slightly red - shifted as the proportion of TT-DCBZ in the polymer increases and thus the onset point ( λ onset ) and maximum peak ( λ max ) are redshifted by ∼ 10 nm from PTBBO ( λ onset = 745 nm , λ max = 675 nm ) to PTBDCB100 ( λ onset = 756 nm , λ max = 683 nm ). The optical energy bandgaps ( E g s ) of PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , and PTBDCB50 are estimated to be ∼ 1.66 eV from the onset points of the absorption spectra and PTBDCB100 shows a decreased E g value of 1.64 eV. The electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ). The electron affinity ( EA ) and the ionization potential ( IP ) energies of the polymers were determined from the onset of the reduction and oxidation potentials , respectively as shown in Table 1. 33,36 Both of the IP and EA energies of the polymers were shifted up as the molar ratio of the TT-DCBZ in the polymer backbone increased and thus , the IP energy of PTBDCB100 ( 4.95 eV ) was 0.22 eV lower than 5.17 eV of PTBBO. Incorporation of the DCBZ group would induce conformational changes of the polymer backbone , which resulted in the red - shifted UV - vis absorption spectra and the change in electrochemical properties. We fabricated solar cells utilizing the prepared polymers in active layers composed of polymer : PC71BM blends. The solar cell device structure is indium tin oxide ( ITO ) / poly ( 3,4ethylenedioxythiophene ) : poly(styrenesulfonate) ( PE - DOT : PSS ) / polymer : PC71BM ( 1 : 1.5 wt / wt ) / TiO2 / Al. The current - voltage ( J-V ) curves of the polymer solar cell devices are shown in Figure 2a and the best and average values of their characteristic photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 2. Overall , the polymers containing DCBZ exhibit better solar cell performances than PTBBO due to their improved J sc values. In the histograms of statistical J sc values ( Figure 2d ) , the DCBZbased polymer showed ∼ 1 mA / cm^2 higher values. In the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of the polymer solar cells ( Figure 2b ) , the EQE values for the range 450-800 nm of all the polymers containing DCBZ are higher than that of PTBBO. The onset point of the PTBDCB100 EQE spectrum is slightly red - shifted with respect to those of the other polymers due to its lower energy bandgap.",

    "sentence": "The highest PCE of 7.87% was obtained for the PTBDCB25 device with an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.77 V , a fill factor ( FF ) of 0.651 , and a J sc of 15.70 mA / cm^2 ( Table 2 ). However , when the DCBZ content of the polymer is increased above that of PTBDCB25 , the solar cell efficiency gradually decreases , which is mainly due to decreases in FF. As a result , PTBDCB100 showed the lowest PCE of 6.96% among the DCBZ based polymers with a FF of 0.589. The V oc values of the polymer devices are in the range 0.76 - 0.77 V and notably , higher than 0.74 V of PTBBO despite that the IP energies of the DCBZ based polymers ( 4.95 - 5.10 eV ) are 0.07 - 0.22 eV lower compared with PTBBO ( 5.17 eV ). Furthermore , the V oc of PTBDCB100 ( 0.76 V ) is a significantly improved value compared with PTB1 ( 0.58 V ) and PTB2 ( 0.60 V ) polymers in spite of their similar polymer structures and IP energies ( 4.8 eV for PTB1 , 4.94 eV for PTB2 , and 4.95 for PTBDCB100 ) to each other. 21 Regarding this , we will discuss further in the next \" theoretical study \" section. By tuning the weight ratio of the polymer : PC71BM composite from 1 : 1.5 to 1 : 1 , the solar cell efficiency of PTBDCB25 was further improved up to 8.30% with a J sc of 16.22 mA / cm^2 , a V oc of 0.76 V , and a FF of 0.673 ( Figure 2c ). To investigate the influence of the DCBZ functionalization of the polymer on the polymer solar cell properties , we investigated the nanostructural properties of the polymer : PC71BM BHJ films in the solar cell devices with transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ). Figure 3 shows the TEM images of the BHJ blend films. It is found that the size and density of dark regions due to PC71BM aggregation decreases as the TT-DCBZ content in the polymer increases. The PTBBO blend film contains 100-200 nm PC71BM - rich domains , whereas the PTBDCB25 and PTBDCB50 blend films have more uniformly intermixed morphologies with nanoscale percolating networks. PTBDCB100 has a homogeneous morphology with very fine features , which indicates that the miscibility of PTBDCB100 with PC71BM is very high. The improved nanomorphology of the DCBZ incorporated polymer blend film is advantageous for enhancing charge carrier generation at the polymer / PC71BM interface in the polymer BHJ solar cells and thereby improve J sc s ; the nanoscale phase separation will increase the probability that the exciton reaches the interface and is dissociated into charge carriers when considering the limited exciton diffusion lengths of conjugated polymers due to the short exciton life times.",

    "sentence": "9,37 On the other hand , if the degree of intermolecular mixing between the polymer and PC71BM is too high such as in PTBDCB100 , poor charge transport pathways and thus bimolecular recombination are likely to result. The decreased FF and lower EQEs of the PTBDCB100 solar cell in 500-800 nm are probably due to such morphology. We performed a TOF - SIMS to investigate the compositional gradient of each polymer : PC71BM blend and Cl - / C 2 - signal ratios were obtained for active layers prepared using different polymers with a film structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM ( Figure S2 ) ; For all blend films , in common , each Cl - / C 2 - and F - / C 2 - signal is constant throughout the active layer , suggesting that there is a homogeneous distribution of the polymer phases in the vertical direction. To obtain a deeper understanding of the nanomorphologies of the polymer : PC71BM blend films at a molecular level , grazing incidence X-ray diffraction ( GIXD ) patterns were recorded for the pristine polymers and the blend films. Figure 4 shows these GIXD patterns and the q z line cut profiles. The patterns for the pristine films of the polymers all contain ( 010 ) diffraction peaks along the q z direction at 1.62 - 1.64 Å -1 , which indicates that their π-π stacking distances are similar in the range 3.83 - 3.87 Å and that the polymer chains mainly remain in the face-on conformation after the introduction of the DCBZ group. In in-plane profiles of the pristine polymer ( Figure S3 ) , the ( 100 ) peaks of PTBDCB50 ( 0.30 Å -1 ) and PTBDCB100 ( 0.31 Å -1 ) are positioned at higher values than PTBBO ( 0.28 Å -1 ) and PTBDCB25 ( 0.28 Å -1 ) , showing the lamellar stacking distances of PTBDCB50 ( 20.9 Å ) and PTBDCB100 ( 20.3 Å ) are shorter than PTBBO ( 22.4 Å ) and PTBDCB25 ( 22.4 Å ). This is because PTBBO and PTBDCB25 contain relatively large portions of the long 2-butyloctyl group when compared with the other polymers. The π-π stacking peaks of PTBDCB50 and PTBDCB100 are more intensive than those of PTBBO and PTBDCB25 although the peaks corresponding to the lamellar spacing are similar in their intensities. This suggests that introduction of the DCBZ group is favorable for effective π-π stacking of the polymer chain. After blending with PC71BM , the lamellar distances of all polymers were slightly decreased by about 2 Å ( Figure S4 ) , and the resulting distances are summarized in Table S1. The GIXD patterns for the polymer : PC71BM blend films contain a scattering peak at q z = ∼ 1.34 Å -1 , which is due to the Bragg diffraction of PC71BM.",

    "sentence": "38 As shown in the out of plane GIXD profile of the polymer : PC71BM blend film , the incorporation of the DCBZ group into the polymer results in a weaker scattering peak of PC71BM than that of PTBBO. Full widths at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of scattering peaks correlated to nanocrystallite sizes via the Scherrer equation ( DL = 2 ( ln2 / π ) 1 / 2 2π(Δq) -1 , where Δq is the intrinsic fwhm of the peak ). 39 In the in-plane GIXD profile ( Figure S5 ) , Gaussian fits were used to determine peak FWHMs , as represented using black solid lines for the peak profiles. The measured Δq values are 0.266 , 0.293 , 0.296 , and 0.274 Å -1 for PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 , respectively. Thus , the calculated PC71BM crystallite sizes in the blend films are estimated to be 22.17 , 20.13 , 19.92 , and 21.52 Å , for PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 , respectively. This result implies that the crystallinity and sizes of the PC71BMnanocrystallites were reduced after incorporation of the DCBZ unit. The high crystallinity of PC71BM in the PTBBO : PC71BM film would correlate with the high level of PC71BM aggregation evident in the TEM image of the PTBBO : PC71BM film. In general , conjugated polymers with high π-π stacking properties exhibit lower miscibility with fullerene derivatives because their selforganization properties disturb intermixing with other compounds and thus lead to large scale phase segregation. 40,41 The nanoscale phase separation of the PTBDCB50 and PTBDCB100 blend films is much improved although PTBDCB50 and PTBDCB100 show more effective π-π stacking structures than that of PTBBO. This is probably due to the enhanced intermolecular interactions between the DCBZ group and PC71BM such as the chlorine-fullerene or dipole-π interactions , 42,43 which result in better compatibility between the polymers and PC71BM and thereby in the well intermixed polymer : PC71BM blend films. Taken together , the TEM and GIXD results show that the introduction of DCBZ groups into the polymers dissolves aggregated PC71BM clusters in the polymer : PC71BM blend films by making the polymer chains more miscible with PC71BM. We compared the surface energies of the polymers calculated using Owens - Wendt geometric mean equation. It is reported that when the surface energy values of the individual components of the blend films are similar , they exhibit better miscibility , which leads to more homogeneously mixed film morphologies. 16,44 software package. We used B3LYP correlation functional with a 6-311G ( d,p ) standard basis set on all atoms in a gas phase. Athough DFT with B3LYP functional has been commonly used , it has been proved that this method could not properly describe dispersive interactions. Therefore , we employed D3 version of Gremme 's dispersion with Becke - Johnson damping ( GD3BJ ) to investigate the intermolecular interaction of PC71BM - polymer complexes adequately.",

    "sentence": "45 The configurations of the energy optimized structures of PC71BM - monomer and PC71BM-side chain complexes are shown in Figure 6. The interaction energy of PC71BM with 3,4-dichlorobenzyloxybutane ( DCBB ) ( 14.61 kcal / mol , Figure 6b ) is larger than that with 2-butyloctane ( BO ) ( 10.45 kcal / mol , Figure 6a ). Interestingly , the enhancement value of 4.16 kcal / mol is comparable to the increase of the interaction energy from 41.1 to 47.71 kcal / mol in the PC71BM - monomer complex system when a 2-butyloctyl side chain in the monomer is replaced by a 3,4-dichlorobenzyloxy)butyl group in Figure 6c,d. The stabilization energy values of the PC71BM-DCBB complex were calculated with varying the distance between PC71BM and DCBB and recorded in Figure S6. The distance yielding the highest stabilization energy ( 3 Å ) is identical to that between the PC71BM and DCBZ group in the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ complex ( Figure 6d ). This result indicates that the incorporation of the DCBZ into the polymer makes PC71BM - polymer interactions energetically favorable and thus increases the miscibility of the polymer with PC71BM. Moreover , the DCBZ group may act to hold the PC71BM molecules so as to prevent large scale phase segregations when polymer : PC71BM blends form BHJ films in polymer solar cell devices. Frontier orbitals and energy diagrams of the PC71BM - monomer complexes are shown in Figure 7a. For both monomers , the HOMO of the complex is essentially confined on the monomer donor while the LUMO is on the PC71BM acceptor. The HOMO energy levels of the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ and PC71BM-PTBBO complexes are , in common , shifted up by 0.13 - 0.14 eV from the HOMO levels of their respective isolated monomer molecules. Interestingly , compared with the computed LUMOs of PC71BM , the LUMO of PCBM-PTBDCBZ is increased by about 0.05 eV while that of PC71BM-PTBBO is decreased by about 0.01 eV. As a result , the energy bandgap of PC71BM-PTBDCBZ is 0.08 eV larger than that of PC71BM-PTBBO. This is consistent with the observation of the larger V oc values for the DCBZ incorporated polymers ( 0.76 - 0.77 V ) than for PTBBO ( 0.74 V ) despite that the former polymers have 0.07 - 0.22 eV lower IP energy levels , as determined by the CV experiment. For a deeper understanding of the effects of the intermolecular interaction between the DCBZ group in the polymer and PC71BM on the energy levels of the complex , we detached the DCBZ group from the complex and observed the resulting energy levels ( Figure 7b ) ; the LUMO energy level was lowered to -3.45 eV and became similar to that of the isolated PC71BM ( -3.46 eV ) while the HOMO level ( -5.18 eV ) remained close to that of PC71BM-PTBDCBZ ( -5.19 eV ) , suggesting that the DCBZ group in the polymer predominantly influenced the LUMO energy level of the PC71BM - polymer complex.",

    "sentence": "In addition , we investigated how the LUMO energy level of PC71BM is affected by the interactions with DCBB because the LUMO of the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ complex is mostly localized on PC71BM and reflected by PC71BM 's LUMO. As shown in Figure S7 , on forming a PC71BM-DCBZ complex , the LUMO level of PC71BM is increased to -3.41 eV , which is identical to the LUMO level of the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ complex. By contrast , the LUMO level of PC71BM is shifted down when the polymer interacts with BO , in agreement with the result obtained for the PC71BM-PTBBO complex. As shown in Figure S8 , changing the distance between PC71BM and DCBB resulted in different frontier orbital energy levels of PC71BM. In particular , the LUMO level at 3 Å , which was found to be the optimal distance for the effective interaction between PC71BM and DCBZ , is identical to that of the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ complex. From the computational results , it is expected that the DCBZ in the polymer induced the increase of the LUMO level of PC71BM positioned at the PC71BM / polymer interface of the BHJ solar cell devices by the intermolecular interactions between the PC71BM and the DCBZ group , resulting in the V oc enhancement of the DCBZ-based polymer solar cells. It is observed that the geometry of the PC71BM detached from the PC71BM-PTBDCBZ ( PC71BM cpx ) complex differs from that of the original structure ( PC71BM org ) ( Figure S9 ) , leading to a decrease in the dipole moment from 4.59 D for PC71BM org to 4.55 D for PC71BM cpx. The computed total energy of PC71BM is increased by about 0.48 kcal / mol after the deformation. It is expected that the intermolecular interaction between PC71BM and the DCBZ group in the complex led to the changes in both the geometry and the electronic structure of PC71BM , resulting in the increase in the LUMO energy level. To further clarify the effects of the morphological changes on the photovoltaic properties , we performed a series of experiments as follows. First , we assessed the charge carrier mobilities of the devices ; a high charge carrier mobility reduces bimolecular charge recombination after free charge carrier generation. 46,47 The hole mobilities of the polymer : PC71BM BHJ films were measured by using the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method ( Figure S10 ). The mobilities of the blend films were found to be 1.6 × 10^-4 , 1.3 × 10^-4 , 9.8 × 10^-5 , and 7.0 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 , respectively ; as more DCBZ is incorporated into the polymer , the mobility in its blend film gradually decreases. This gradual decrease probably arises because charge transport is more disturbed by the limited transport pathway as the polymer is more miscible with PC71BM.",

    "sentence": "This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the mobility in the PTBDCB100 blend film is the lowest among the polymer blend films despite its high π-π stacking property in the GIXD result of the pristine polymer film. The lower FF value of the PTBDCB100 device compared with those of the other devices is related with the decreased charge transport of PTBDCB100 , which may lead to the increase of bimolecular recombination in the solar cell device. Thus , the higher photocurrent levels of the DCBZ-based polymer devices can not be explained in terms of charge transport and other factors need to be explored. Next , the efficiency of charge carrier generation at the polymer / PC71BM interfaces should be considered. From the calculated energy offsets between the LUMO energy levels of the polymer and PC71BM ( ∼ -3.7 eV ) , 21 each polymer solar cell is expected to have sufficient driving force to produce efficient charge transfer / separation at its polymer / PC71BM interface. In fact , the photon energy losses of the polymer devices , which are defined by E g - eV oc , are similar , with values of 0.92 , 0.89 , 0.90 , and 0.88 eV for PTBBO , PTBDCB25 , PTBDCB50 , and PTBDCB100 , respectively. These results suggest that the polymers have similar quantum efficiencies of charge generation. 48 Third , photocurrent generation is usually explained in terms of nongeminate recombination. We determined the dependence on light intensity of the photocurrent density for each of the PTBBO and PTBDCB25 solar cell devices , in order to characterize their recombination mechanisms. This dependence can be modeled with a power law relationship J ∝ P α where P is the power generation rate and the deviation of α from unity is due to bimolecular recombination and the buildup of space charges in the active layer. 49-51 Figure S7 shows the photocurrent densities ( J ph = J L - J D ) as functions of light intensity at the various effective voltages , where J L and J D are the current density under illumination and in the dark , respectively. The effective voltage is defined as V eff = V 0 - V appl , where V 0 is the compensation voltage at J ph = 0 and V appl is the applied voltage. For both of the polymer devices , there is a linear relationship between the logarithmic scales of the photocurrent density and the light intensity at V eff values of 0.1 V , short - circuit , and 1.5 V , respectively , and at the given V eff , the slops of the polymers are very similar to each other ; the slopes are ∼ 0.91 at the short - circuit condition and V eff = 1.5 V , and 0.81 - 0.82 at V eff = 0.1 V. The result indicates that the degrees of bimolecular recombination and space charge effects are similarly small for both of the polymer solar cells.",

    "sentence": "50,51 Finally , the enlarged interface area in the polymer : PC71BM blend films with the introduction of DCBZ into the polymers might result in increases of the probabilities that the photogenerated excitons reach the polymer : PC71BM interfaces and separate into free charge carriers. To verify this hypothesis , we examined the photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching of polymer : PC71BM blend films prepared under the same conditions as the solar cell active layers. Parts a and b of Figure 8 show the PL spectra recorded with excitations at 380 and 675 nm , respectively , and the maximum PL peaks of PC71BM and the polymers are at 700 and 750 nm , respectively. In the pristine polymer films , all polymers showed almost identical PL spectra to each other. It is found that the PL quenching degree at both 700 and 750 nm is correlated with the DCBZ content of the polymer ; the polymers with a higher DCBZ proportion exhibit a higher degree of PL quenching. In particular , because the PL from excitation at 380 nm is PC71BM emission dominant , 6,52 the degree of PL quenching after 380 nm excitation is able to stay relative to nonradiative quenching of excitons within the PC71BMnanoclusters by the polymer. Two mechanisms possibly contributed to the quenching of PC71BM emission in the blend film : hole transfer to the polymer or resonant energy transfer ( RET ) to the polymer. The PL spectrum of PC71BM is well overlapped with the absorption spectra of the polymers in the range of 670-800 nm. Both of the quenching processes are dependent on the distance from the exciton to the polymer chain present near the polymer : PC71BM interface. 53-55 Therefore , from the relative PL intensity for the 380 nm excitation , we can estimate the relative sizes of the PC71BMnanoclusters and the total polymer / PC71BM interface areas of the blend films : for the PC71BMnanocluster sizes PTBBO > PTBDCB25 > PTBDCB50 > PTBDCB100 and for the interface areas PTBDCB100 > PTBDCB50 > PTBDCB25 > PTBBO. These results confirm that the incorporation of DCBZ at the terminal of the side chains makes the polymer chains more miscible with PC71BM and thus increases the polymer : PC71BM interface area , which results in more efficient charge carrier generation and thereby the J sc enhancement in the solar cells. As a result , the improvement in the photocurrent densities of the devices with the polymers containing DCBZ is mainly due to the improved exciton dissociation into free charge carriers. This is mostly contributed by the increased polymer / PC71BM interface area resulting from the better miscibility of the polymers containing DCBZ with PC71BM. However , excessive DCBZ incorporation resulted in decreases in FF ( for the PTBDCB25 device , FF = 0.651 , and for the PTBDCB100 device , FF = 0.589 ) , which are due to the reduction in charge transport arising from limited pathways in the excessively intermixed BHJ film.",

    "sentence": "Therefore , it is vital to optimize the morphology of the polymer : PC71BM blend film with respect to phase separation by incorporating an proper amount of the DCBZ group into the polymer . We have presented the control of the molecular interaction of polymer and PC71BM via the synthesis of push - pull - type random copolymers containing various ratios of TT-DCBZ and TT-BO accepting units and their effects on photovoltaic properties. Introduction of the DCBZ group into the polymer resulted in several positive effects. First , the DCBZ group enhanced the compatibility of the polymer with PC71BM without having detrimental effects on the polymer 's physical properties such as its optical properties or polymer packing structures in the solid state. Therefore , we can obtain optimal film morphology for achieving high solar cell efficiencies. More importantly , the interaction between PC71BM and DCBZ induced the PC71BM 's molecular geometry to a higher energy state and changed the PC71BM 's electronic structure. This led to the increase of the PC71BM 's LUMO level and thereby the enhanced V oc . Additionally , because of the versatility of this copolymerization - based approach , it can be readily extended to other conjugated polymeric systems for use in polymer : fullerene BHJ based solar cells. As a result , by tuning the ratio of TT-DCBZ and TT-BO monomers , the polymer solar cell employing PTBDCB25 was fabricated with a PCE of 8.30% . We believe that the random copolymerization of monomers with fullerene - compatible functional groups is an effective way for simultaneously enhancing J sc and V oc by controlling the nanomorphology and the electronic structure of acceptors in donor : acceptor BHJ solar cells. We are exploring other fullerene - compatible functional groups to obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of formation of polymer : fullerene BHJ films and their effects on the photovoltaic properties .",

The effects of the different conjugated side groups on the thermal , photophysical , electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these copolymers were investigated. As the length of the conjugated side groups increased , the absorption of the UV - vis region in solution was red - shifted. By changing the different side groups , the energy levels and band gaps of the resulted copolymers were effectively tuned. The three copolymers exhibit deep HOMO energy level and relatively high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ). Bulk heterojunction solar cells with these copolymers as electron donors and (6,6)-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) as an electron acceptor exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 2.48% , 4.18% and 1.16% for PT-ID , PT - DTBT , and PT - DTBTID , respectively . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their potential for low cost , lightweight , and good compatibility with the roll - to - roll process for making flexible large area devices. 1-3 So far , the most successful polymer solar cells are bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) devices , 4-7 which use a phase separated blend of organic electron donor and acceptor components , where the conjugated polymer is often used as the donor and the fullerene derivative is used as the acceptor. 8 It has been realized that an ideal polymer donor in PSCs should exhibit broad absorption with high absorption coefficient in the visible region , high hole mobility , suitable energy level matching with the fullerene acceptor , and appropriate compatibility with the fullerene acceptor to form nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network. 9 Optimizing the properties of the polymer donor will offer higher short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , fill - factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the PSCs. One feasible approach toward broadening the absorption spectrum and tuning the energy levels is to design alternating donor - acceptor ( D-A ) copolymers , in which the hybridization of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) located on the donor moiety with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) located on the acceptor moiety provides a means of narrowing the band gap and tuning the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers. 10,11 Among these main chain D-A copolymers , it has been demonstrated that benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene ( BDT ) is the most potential and effective electron - rich donor unit. 12 In the past two years , a series of new D-A low band gap polymers based on BDT have been reported.",

    "sentence": "For example , the solar cells based on a BDT copolymer PBDTTT have achieved a series of high PCE values in the range of 5-7 % . 9,13 Although main chain D-A copolymers have been witnessed great success for achieving high performance PSCs , they may suffer from lower hole mobility due to the influence of the acceptor units on the polymer main chain. 14 A new family of polymers with conjugated side groups or side chains has been developed by several research groups , including ours. 8,15,16 This type of polymers features high hole mobility benefiting from the overlapping of the conjugated side chain interactions with the conjugated main chains , and broad absorption spectra deriving from both the main chains and the conjugated side chains , thus demonstrated prominent device performances in PSCs. 15 Here , we designed and synthesized three copolymers PT-ID , PT - DTBT , PT - DTBTID ( as shown in Figure 1 ) based on BDT and thiophene with different conjugated side groups. In order to broaden the absorption spectra of the π-conjugated polymers , 1,3-indanedione ( ID ) and 4,7-dithien-5-yl-2,1,3-benzodiathiazole ( DTBT ) as electron - deficient units are to be introduced into side chains of PT-ID and PT - DTBT , respectively. Furthermore , a long side chain ( DTBT-ID ) composed of DTBT and ID is introduced to form the polymer PT - DTBTID. These conjugated side groups attached to the main chains via vinylene groups. The vinylene linkage serves to enhance coplanarity of the polymer backbone and extend the π-conjugation by further eliminating torsional strains between the main chain and electron - deficient side groups , leading to a lower optical band gap and tunable frontier molecular orbital energy levels. The effects of the conjugated side groups on the thermal , photophysical , electrochemical , and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers were investigated in detail . PT-ID , PT - DTBT , and PT - DTBTID exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as CHCl 3 , THF , CH 2 Cl 2 and chlorobenzene at room temperature. Table 1 summarized the polymerization results and thermal properties of the copolymers. The number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of PT - CHO and PT - DTBTCHO are 11.6 and 11.4 kg mol^-1 with polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 1.66 and 2.00 , respectively. The M n of the target copolymers PT-ID ( 12.1 kg mol^-1 ) and PT - DTBTID ( 12.5 kg mol^-1 ) show a slight increase than those of PT - CHO and PT - DTBTCHO due to the reaction between of 1,3-indanedione and aldehyde group.

    "sentence": "As shown in Figure 2 and Table 1 , the TGA curves reveal that the degradation temperatures ( T d ) of 5% weight loss of PT-ID , PT - DTBT , and PT - DTBTID , are 321 , 368 , and 301 °C , respectively. And the glass transition temperatures ( T g ) are 160 , 155 , and 165 °C for PT-ID , PT - DTBT , and PT - DTBTID , respectively ( Figure 3 ). We have also measured the DSC curves at different scan rates , and no crystallization or melting peaks are observed upon further heating beyond the T g . The results indicate that these copolymers are amorphous. It is clear that the introduction of 1,3-indanedione group in the side chains of the conjugated polymers improves the glass transition temperature. The good thermal stability of the copolymers retards the deformation of the polymer morphology and the degradation of the active layer at elevated temperatures , which are desirable for polymers in PSCs applications. 20 Photophysical Properties. The photophysical properties of the copolymers were investigated by UV - vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The correlative data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 2. Figure 4 gives the UV - vis absorption spectra of PT-ID , PT - DTBT , and PT - DTBTID in diluted CHCl 3 solution. All copolymers show two distinct absorption bands. The first absorption bands with the absorption maxima ( λ s,max ) at 423 nm for PT-ID , 390 nm for PT - DTBT and 387 nm for PT - DTBTID can be identified with a delocalized excitonic π-π* transition and the second absorption bands of them with λ s,max at 565 , 504 , and 526 nm , respectively , can be attributed to a localized transition between donor - acceptor charge transfer states. 21,22 PT - DTBTID exhibits the broader absorption which derived from the ICT interaction between the main chain and the conjugated side chains. 23 Obviously , the ICT interactions of the PT - DTBTID are progressively enhanced due to the increase of the electron affinity of the DTBTID group. 10 In comparison with the absorption spectra of the polymer solutions , the absorption spectra of the films are broadened and the peaks are red - shifted. This phenomenon results from the enhanced interchain interaction in the solid films , which is probably related to the increased extent of π-π stacking of the backbones and increased polarizability of the film , or both. 24-26 The optical band gaps ( E g opt ) of PT-ID , PT - DTBT and PT - DTBTID are 1.75 , 1.92 , and 1.66 eV , respectively , calculated from the onset of the film absorptions. The photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of copolymers in the diluted CHCl 3 solution are shown in Figure 5. The copolymers are excited at the wavelength corresponding to the two λ s,max .",

    "sentence": "For example , PT - DTBT exhibits the same PL spectra when it is excited at 390 and 504 nm , respectively , which indicates that there is a thorough intramolecular energy transfer of the excitons from the conjugated side chains to the main chains. This phenomenon ensures that all photons absorbed by the copolymers are useful for the photovoltaic conversion. 27 In CHCl 3 solution , PT-ID exhibits a maximum emission peak ( λ f,max ) at 663 nm. With DTBT and DTBTID as the conjugated side groups , the λ f,max of PT - DTBT ( 682 nm ) and PT - DTBTID ( 705 nm ) are redshifted by 19 and 42 nm , respectively , compared with that of PT - ID. All the results clearly indicate that the photophysical properties of these copolymers could be tuned by changing conjugated side groups. Electrochemical Properties. The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the conjugated polymers are important parameters in the design of optoelectronic devices , and they can be estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials of cyclic voltammogram ( CV ). 28 Figure 6 shows the CV curves of the three copolymers and that of ferrocene for potential calibration. The redox potential of ferrocene is 0.51 V vs SCE. On the basis of 4.8 eV below vacuum for the energy level of Fc / Fc + , the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of as well as the electrochemical energy gaps ( E g ec ) of copolymers were calculated according to the following equations : The onset potentials for oxidation ( E ox ) were observed to be 0.93 , 1.15 , and 0.96 V for PT-ID , PT - DTBT , and PT - DTBTID , respectively. On the other hand , the onset potentials for reduction ( E red ) of them were found to be -0.89 , -0.85 , and -0.75 V , respectively. Accordingly , the HOMO energy levels of PT-ID , PT - DTBT , and PT - DTBTID , are -5.22 , -5.44 , zand -5.25 eV , respectively. Regarding the threshold HOMO energy level for air stable conjugated polymers being estimated to be -5.2 eV , 29,30 the deep HOMO levels of the three copolymers with acceptor groups ( DTBT , ID , and DTBTID ) should be beneficial to their chemical stability in ambient conditions. In addition , the deep HOMO levels of the copolymers are desirable for higher open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the PSCs with copolymers as donor materials 31 because the V oc is usually proportional to the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor. The HOMO energy level of PT - DTBT is ∼ 0.2 eV lower than those of PT-ID and PT - DTBTID , predicting that PT - DTBT would achieve the highest V oc value.",

    "sentence": "That is because the electron deficient nature of the DTBTID group provides a wider photo responsive range ( Figure 8 ) , but it can also act as a trapping site , inhibiting electron transfer from the main chain to the acceptor and as a result to produce low IPCE values and poor photovoltaic performance for PT - DTBTID. 37 In addition , the bulky side chain ( DTBTID ) of the PT - DTBTID leads to a significant decrease in J sc , consequently , a decrease in the PCE of the solar cell. PT - DTBT with DTBT as the side chains shows the highest PCE due to the highest J sc and V oc . Therefore , the side group DTBT seems to be better than ID , and ID seems to be better than DTBTID. To further understand the cause of variation in solar cell performance , the hole mobility of these copolymers was measured using the OTFT technique under the same conditions. The mobility values of the copolymers are listed in Table 3. PT - DTBT with the DTBT side chain demonstrated a relatively high hole mobility of 3.2 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 which is two order higher than those of PT-ID ( 6 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) and PT - DTBTID ( 3 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) ( Table 3 ). Furthermore , the hole mobility of PT-ID is double of PT - DTBTID. Therefore , the high hole mobility of the PT - DTBT further clearly explain why the photovoltaic properties of the PT - DTBT are better than those of PT-ID and PT - DTBTID . In summary , three novel alternating copolymers based on benzo 1,2-b:4,5-b′ dithiophen and thiophene with different conjugated side groups have been successfully synthesized and characterized. The three copolymers show good solubility and film - forming ability. Through manipulating the length of the acceptor groups attached at the conjugated side chains of the copolymers , the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the copolymers are effectively tuned. The best power conversion efficiency of the PSCs based on PT - DTBT / PC61BM ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) reached to 4.18% under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . The broad absorption spectrum , deep HOMO level and the noticeably high hole mobility of PT - DTBT contribute to the outstanding J sc , V oc as well as the high device efficiency .",

    "sentence": "Three novel isoindigo based donor - acceptor ( D-A ) conjugated polymers P1-3 have been synthesized by Suzuki polycondensation and utilized as donor materials for polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). These three polymers are of the same backbone , but have different substituents. All these polymers exhibit high thermal stability and broad absorption in the range of 300 to 770 nm. Hole mobilities of polymer films spin coated from 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) solutions are 7.00 x 10^-4 , 2.37 x 10^-3 and 2.90 x 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for P1 , P2 and P3 , respectively. PSCs based on P2 : PC71BM ( 1 : 2 by weight ) with a 2% DIO additive displayed a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.41% with a short - circuit current density ( J sc ) of 7.57 mA cm^-2 , an open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.85 V , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 53% , under the illumination of AM 1.5G ( 100 mW cm^-2 ). XRD diffraction measurements have shown that these polymers have a short p-p stacking distance in the solid state. The results demonstrate that these conjugated polymers could be promising donor materials in the application of polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells have experienced two rapid development periods aer the appearance of the bulk heterojunction concept for the active layer and the use of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) conjugated polymers as the donor materials. 1 The innovations in materials and device structure have boosted the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs to higher than 10% . 2,3 The active layer of a bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell is a blend of donor and acceptor , which forms an interpenetrated network for highly efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation and the transportation of the formed free charges. 4,5 To achieve high efficiency polymer solar cells , some design criteria of p - type polymer donors are ( i ) low lying HOMO energy level to increase the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) ; ( ii ) narrow band gap to broaden the absorption range to achieve higher short - circuit current ( J sc ) ; ( iii ) high hole mobility for charge transport. Alternating the D-A approach , which involves the copolymerization of an electron rich monomer with an electron decient monomer , is the most attractive and successful strategy for controlling the energy level and optical band gap of copolymers through the intramolecular charge transfer from donor to acceptor unit. [6][7][8][9] On the basis of this concept , a large number of novel D-A type low band gap polymers have been synthesized and used in PSCs.",

Isoindigo , which is an easily synthesized strong electron withdrawing unit , constitutes a planar moiety capable of forming strong p-p stacks in the solid state. Many isoindigo based D-A alternating conjugated polymers have been synthesized and used for PSC and eld effect transistor ( FET ) applications. The hole and electron mobilities of isoindigo based D-A conjugated polymers have reached 0.81 and 0.66 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. 37 PSCs based on isoindigo containing D-A conjugated polymers furnished PCEs up to 6.2% . 38 Among the commonly used acceptor units , BT , which is a widely used planar acceptor unit , can be facilely modied by substitution at the 5-and 6-positions. Many D-A alternating conjugated polymers containing BT have been synthesized and used for PSCs. Especially , D-A alternating conjugated polymers with BT as the acceptor unit , carbazole or uorene as the donor unit , and thiophene as the spacer have furnished good PSC device performance. 10,39,40 Although the polymer solar cells gave a high open circuit voltage ( V oc ) , the short circuit current ( J sc ) is still low due to the narrower absorption. To broaden the absorption , BT has been used to polymerize with strong electron donors such as dithienosilole to achieve D-A type conjugated polymers with broad absorption. 41,42 Conjugated polymers based on a strong electron donor unit and BT usually have a higher HOMO energy level , which is prone to result in lower V oc . 2,3,[43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50] To achieve conjugated polymers with broad absorption and a deeper HOMO energy level , we designed and synthesized a series of conjugated polymers containing BT as the acceptor unit , isoindigo as the second acceptor unit , and thiophene as the spacer. As expected , these polymers as thin lms exhibit intense and broad absorption and a deep HOMO energy level ( < 5.44 eV ) with a band gap in the range of 1.60 - 1.63 eV.

    "sentence": "Among these three copolymers , the PSC based on P2 : PC71BM ( 1 : 2 by weight ) with diiodooctane ( DIO ) ( 2% by volume ) as the additive showed the best performance with a PCE of 3.41% and a V oc of 0.85 V under an illumination of AM 1.5G ( 100 mW cm^-2 ). Thermal properties of P1-3 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) at a scanning speed of 10 °C min -1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. A 5% mass loss is dened as the thermolysis threshold. As shown in Fig. 1 , P1-3 exhibited good thermal stability and the thermolysis onsets of P1 , P2 , and P3 are located at 316 , 438 , and 399 °C , respectively. The data are also summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. S1 ( see ESI ) , † for all polymers , no noticeable thermal transition was observed from 25 to 300 °C by DSC measurements , which is probably attributed to the stiff backbone that limits the chain motion . The packing of polymer chains in the solid state plays a pivotal role in determining the hole mobility of polymer lms and the power conversion efficiency of PSCs. Therefore , X-ray diffractions ( XRD ) of P1-3 powdery samples were performed to investigate the packing of polymer chains in the solid state and the diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. S2. † P1 and P3 exhibited ve sharp diffraction peaks ; whereas the diffraction peaks for P2 became weaker and broader. The rst peak ( d 1 ) , usually denoted as the ( 100 ) reection , 53 at the small angle region can be attributed to the distance the conjugated polymer chains were separated by the two extended alkyl chains. The interchain separation distances are 20.45 , 20.75 , and 20.11Å for P1 , P2 , and P3 , respectively. The last diffraction peak ( d 2 ) , usually denoted as the ( 010 ) diffraction , 53 at the wide angle region probably corresponds to the p-p stacking distance between polymer backbones. The p-p stacking distances are 3.49 , 3.61 , and 3.47Å for P1 , P2 , and P3 , respectively. These results indicated that P1 and P3 formed a more ordered and closer packing in the solid state than P2. The close packing of P1 and P3 polymer chains in the solid state is probably due to the following two reasons. For P1 , the existence of intramolecular S-O interactions endows the polymer backbone with a more planar conformation ; 54,55 whereas for P3 , the existence of uorine atoms in the polymer backbone usually enhances the interchain interactions and makes the polymer chains pack closer. [56][57][58] To access a good deal of information about the electronic structure of polymers , photophysical properties of P1-3 were investigated by UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy.",

    "sentence": "The absorption spectra of P1-3 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) solutions at room temperature and elevated temperature and as thin lms are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2a , P1 in DCB solution at room temperature exhibited a broad absorption in the visible region with one weak absorption peak located at a Determined by GPC using polystyrene standards with THF as the eluent. b The 5% weight - loss temperatures under a nitrogen atmosphere. Fig. 1 TGA plots of P1-3 at a heating rate of 10 °C min -1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. 347 nm , one intense absorption peak located at 633 nm , and one shoulder at 496 nm. P1 in DCB solution at elevated temperature showed almost the same absorption spectrum , only the intensity of the shoulder absorption at 496 nm decreased. Compared with solution absorption spectra , the absorption spectrum of P1 as a thin lm became broader and red - shied. A new absorption peak at 700 nm appeared , which can be ascribed to the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. The absorption spectra of P2 in DCB solutions at room temperature and elevated temperature are almost the same ; whereas the absorption spectrum of P2 as a thin lm is broader and red - shied with two absorption bands in the long wavelength region with peaks at 621 and 668 nm , respectively , indicating the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. P3 in DCB solution at room temperature displayed a broad absorption in the visible region with two peaks at 331 and 608 nm and a shoulder at 497 nm. At elevated temperature , the absorption spectrum of P3 in DCB solution is blue shied and the two peaks are located at 328 and 575 nm , respectively. As a thin lm , the absorption spectrum of P3 is markedly red shied and broadened and exhibited two absorption peaks located at 627 and 684 nm , respectively , in the long wavelength region. These results indicated that P1 and P2 formed real solutions in DCB at room temperature and elevated temperature ; whereas P3 aggregated in DCB solution at room temperature , which can be dissociated at elevated temperature. The high energy band is attributed to the p-p* transition and the low energy band originates from the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) from the donor unit to the acceptor. Optical band gaps ( E opt g ) of P1 , P2 , and P3 lms estimated from absorption edges of lm spectra are 1.60 , 1.63 , and 1.62 eV , respectively. The narrower band gap of P1 than that of P2 and P3 is probably due to the incorporation of electron donating alkoxy side groups on the benzothiadiazole moiety of P1 , which elevates the HOMO energy level and decreases the band gap. The broad absorption and small optical band gap make these polymers promising materials for PSCs. The photophysical parameters are also tabulated in Table 2 .",

    "sentence": "Electrochemical properties of P1-3 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) with a standard three - electrode electrochemical cell in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexa-uorophosphate ( TBAPF 6 ) solution in acetonitrile using polymer lms on the Pt working electrode with a scanning rate of 50 mV s^-1 under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. CV curves of the polymer lms are shown in Fig. 3 , and the electrochemical data are also summarized in Table 2. HOMO energy levels of P1 , P2 , and P3 were calculated to be -5.44 , -5.49 and -5.52 eV , respectively , from the onset of oxidative peaks using the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ) , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential in volts. Considering that the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of PSCs is correlated to the difference in the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , the deep HOMO level of P1-3 is prone to give high V oc PSCs. The two substituents on the benzothiadiazole unit can slightly affect the HOMO energy level of copolymers. The HOMO energy level of non-substituted benzothiadiazole based P2 is -5.49 eV. P1 with two electron donating octyloxy substituents on the 5,6-positions of the benzothiadiazole unit showed the highest HOMO energy level of -5.44 eV within these three polymers. The introduction of two electron withdrawing uoro substituents on the 5,6-positions of the benzothiadiazole unit can lower the HOMO energy level of copolymers. P3 has the lowest HOMO energy level of -5.52 eV. Therefore a higher V oc is expected for P3 - based PSCs. According to the equation E LUMO = E HOMO + E bandgap , the LUMO energy levels of P1 , P2 , and P3 are calculated to be -3.84 , -3.86 , and -3.90 eV , respectively . High efficiency polymer solar cells require that the donoracceptor blend lms are of balanced charge carrier mobility. Carrier transport properties of polymers were therefore investigated by fabrication of bottom-gate / top - contact organic thin lm eld effect transistors ( FETs ). Thin lm FETs were fabricated by spin coating the polymer solutions in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene ( TCB ) on the OTS - modied Si / SiO 2 substrates. The as-prepared spin - coated P1-3 lms did not exhibit observable eld effects ; therefore polymer lms , which were subjected to thermal annealing at 160 °C for 30 min , were used for the FET measurements. The output and transfer characteristic curves of P1 , P2 , and P3 lms on OTS - treated Si / SiO 2 substrates are shown in Fig. 4.",

In contrast to P2 , PCEs of P1 and P3 based PSCs were drastically decreased aer the addition of DIO ( 2.0% , by volume ) as an additive. Devices showed a PCE of 1.97% with a J sc of 5.03 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.76 V , and an FF of 0.51 for P1 and a PCE of 1.50% with a V oc of 0.78 V , a J sc of 3.58 mA cm^-2 and an FF of 0.54 for P3. The higher V oc of P3 based PSCs is ascribed to the deepest HOMO energy level of P3 among these three polymers , due to the strong electron withdrawing effect of the uorine atoms. Current density - voltage ( J-V ) curves of the optimized photovoltaic cells are shown in Fig. 5. All devices are tested under 1 sun of simulated AM 1.5G solar radiation ( 100 mW cm^-2 ) and the data are summarized in Table 3. To evaluate the accuracy of the J sc measurement results , external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) of PSCs were measured under illumination by monochromatic light. As shown in Fig. 5b , PSCs based on P1-3:PC71BM ( 1 : 2 , by weight ) fabricated without ( P1 and P3 ) and with 2% DIO as additive ( P2 ) exhibited a signicant broad photoresponse ranging from 400 to 750 nm , which is consistent Fig. 4 Output and transfer characteristics of ( a and b ) P1 , ( c and d ) P2 , and ( e and f ) P3 devices ( spin - coated from TCB solutions , 10 mg mL -1 ) at V SD = -60 V ( L = 50 mm , W = 2.5 mm ) after thermal annealing at 160 °C for 30 min. with the UV - vis absorption spectra of the blend lms shown in Fig. 2d.

    "sentence": "The ability to increase light harvesting while maintaining a deep highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and high solubility remains challenging when designing new conjugated polymers as materials for polymer photovoltaic applications. 9 In attempts to harvest more photons and to tune the energy levels , several polymers have been developed featuring conjugated electron donor / acceptor ( D / A ) units in their main chain 10-25 or two - dimensional ( 2-D ) conjugated configurations. 26-38 At present , the efficiencies of PSCs are now reaching beyond 10% as a result of our better understanding of the photon - to - electron conversion mechanism and the development of novel materials and tandem device architectures. 39-42 Thiophene - containing polymers are among the materials most investigated for use in BHJ PSCs because of their π-conjugated character and high synthetic versatility ; accordingly , an effective method to modify the optical and electronic properties of such polymers is to replace the sulfur ( S ) atoms within their aromatic rings with selenium ( Se ) atoms. Selenophene is a chalcogenophene homologue that has chemical and physical properties similar to those of thiophene ; the relatively lower aromaticity of selenophene increases the ground - state quinoid resonance character of its resulting polymers , leading to improved planarity , increased effective conjugation length , and lower band - gap energy. The Se atom is much larger and less electronegative than the S atom ; thus , Secontaining polymers are generally more effective at extending the absorption spectrum toward the infrared region. In addition , the Se - containing units are more polarizable than their S - containing analogues , often resulting in greater charge mobility of the polymer as a result of interchain Se°°°Se interactions. Indeed , Se - based conjugated polymers provide the opportunity to enhance the interchain interactions and the carrier transport phenomena because the heteroaromatic interactions of Se atoms are generally stronger than those of S atoms , favorable for applications in organic field effect transistors ( OFETs ). 43-45 Similarly , the conductivity and charge mobility of selenophene - based polymers are greater than those of corresponding thiophene - based polymers because of greater π-overlap resulting from the larger π-orbitals of Se atoms. 46 Recently , it was reported that replacing the S atoms with Se atoms in the π-bridges of conjugated polymers can decrease the band - gap energy and enhance the charge transport properties in OFETs. 44,45 The photovoltaic performance of these Secontaining polymers was , however , lower than that of corresponding polymers containing thiophene π-bridges , primarily a result of higher HOMO energy levels and , thus , lower values of V oc for the photovoltaic devices. 47-52 Nevertheless , a low-band-gap polymer containing selenophene π-bridges that provided a promising PCE of 7.2% , significantly higher than that ( 5.01% ) of the corresponding polymer incorporating thiophene π-bridges , was reported.",

    "sentence": "53 Another useful Se - containing electron - deficient building block is benzoselenadiazole ( BS ) , a benzothiadiazole ( BT ) analogue in which the S atom has been replaced by a Se atom. 54-57 When BS - based polymers have been used in PSCs , however , they have generally provided unsatisfactory PCEs ( up to only 2.5% ) because of relatively low values of V oc and poorer morphologies than their corresponding BT - based polymers. 54 Nevertheless , Tajima et al. reported a low-band-gap , BS - based polymer that provided PCEs ( up to 5.18% ) that were slightly higher than that ( 5.01% ) of the corresponding BT - based analogue. 58 Furthermore , some Se - substituted D-π-A copolymers in which the Se atoms were located in the side chain or in the electron - donating building block have also provided unsatisfactory PCEs. 59-62 Promising results have been obtained , however , when using selenolo [3,2-b]thiophene , a new electron - rich building block ; its polymers have provided similar values of V oc and FF and higher values of J sc than those of its corresponding S - based derivatives , with the device efficiencies increasing from 5.6 to 6.8% . 63 The seemingly contradictory results detailed above suggest that there is a need to develop novel Se - based D-A - type copolymers while further investigating the effects of Se - atom substitution. The incorporation of Se atoms into polymers decreases PCEs primarily because of higher HOMO energy levels 47-52,54-57 and limited solubility , 54,55 thereby leading to lower values of V oc and less - appropriate nanomorphologies of their PCBM - blended thin films. Nevertheless , the questions remain on how and why the performances of such organic electronic devices differ so greatly. Elucidating the relationship between structure - manipulated molecular aggregates and device performance is fundamentally important for both device optimization and the structural design of new copolymers. In this study , we chose benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) , a weak electron donor , 64,65 as the electron - rich unit ; it is attractive for use as an electron - donating unit because of its structural symmetry and rigid fused aromatic systemfeatures that can enhance electron delocalization and improve charge mobility. 66 To improve the solubility of polymers containing the Se - containing versions of this heterocycle , we added two alkoxy groups to the electron - deficient moieties to form benzooxadiazole ( BO ) as the acceptor ; we also used thiophene as the π-bridge for mitigating the torsion angle between the BDT and BO units. To investigate the effect of the Se atom substitution , we synthesized eight 2-D conjugated D-π-A copolymers having different modes of Se substitution on the side chain , the πbridge , and the electron - deficient building block. We would like to probe the effects of their structures on their absorption spectra , energy levels , hole mobility in their films , and photovoltaic performance.",

Scheme 1 outlines our design concept for the preparation of the 2-D conjugated polymers ; Scheme S1 outlines our syntheses of the designed 2-D conjugated polymers.

Physical and Thermal Stability. Table 1 summarizes the physical characteristics of all of the copolymers prepared in this study. They all exhibited high polymerization yields ( 60-80 % ) and high molecular weights ( M n = 31.2 - 67.3 kg mol^-1 ) after a series of Soxhlet extractions , a result of the good solubilities of the copolymers after adding the alkyl chains to both the D and A moieties. It has been reported previously that solubilizing alkyl chains can have a very significant influence on the polymerization yields and molecular weights of D-A copolymers. 70,71 Heteroatom substitution on these D-A copolymers slightly affected their polymerization yields and molecular weights , due to the same polymer backbone being shared by the S-and Se - containing copolymers. All of the copolymers had 5% weight - loss temperatures ( T d ) of over 300 °C ( Figure . 1 ) , indicating their good thermal stability. In addition , copolymers having the same polymer backbone exhibited similar values of Td. We ascribe this behavior to the thermal decomposition of the copolymers beginning at their soft parts ( alkyl chains ) , which were identical for the same type of copolymer. Optical Properties.",

Figure 2a displays the absorption spectra of solutions of P1-P8 in DCB at room temperature ; each absorption spectrum , recorded from a dilute DCB solution , featured two absorption bands : one at 300-500 nm , which we assign to localized π-π* transitions , and the other , a broad band from 500 to 750 nm ( i.e. , in the long wavelength region ) corresponding to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the D and A units. The absorption spectra of the eight polymers in the solid state were similar to their corresponding solution spectra , with only slight red - shifts of their absorption maxima , suggesting the presence of a few intermolecular interactions in the solid state. This behavior is in contrast to that of many conjugated polymers , in which a greater red - shift occurs upon proceeding from solution to the solid state , due to the aggregation of the polymer chains in the latter. Table 2 summarizes the optical data , including the absorption peak wavelengths ( λ max,abs ) , absorption edge wavelengths ( λ onset ) , and optical band gaps ( E g opt ) of the eight polymers. Notably , although the absorption profiles of the Se - substituted polymers were similar to that of the thiophene analogue , PBDTTTBO ( P1 ) , the absorption onsets of the Se - substitution polymers were red - shifted significantly ( by 40-100 nm ). The absorption onset is red - shifted by 40 nm when Se - substitution replaced the chalcogenophene units of the 2-D conjugated polymer in a single moiety , such as the π-bridges or electron - deficient building blocks. Furthermore , when we replaced both the πbridge and electron - deficient building block with Se atoms simultaneously , the absorption onset red - shifted by 100 nm. In contrast , modifying the side - chain groups , by changing thiophene to selenophene units , did not affect the absorption edge but did enhance the absorption coefficient ( Figure . 2b ). Replacing the thiophene moieties with selenophene units decreased the optical band gaps as a result of the increased quinoid character of the polymer backbone. A closer look at the film absorptions revealed that the full widths at half - maximum ( FWHMs , Table 2 ) of the Se - substituted polymers were wider than that of PBDTTTBO ( P1 ) , the result of characteristic strong intermolecular Se°°°Se interactions , which could potentially increase the value of J sc further.

First , when we replaced the side chain group from thiophene to selenophene ( e.g. , P1 ↔ P4 , P2 ↔ P6 , P3 ↔ P7 , P5 ↔ P8 ) , the HOMO energy levels did not drift. Second , when a selenophene moiety replaced a thiophene unit in the 2-D conjugated polymer in the π-bridge , the HOMO energy level increases slightly , from -5.46 to -5.4 eV ( e.g. , P3 and P7 ). Third , when the Secontaining units replaced the electron - deficient building blocks , the BS moiety dominated , increasing the HOMO energy level to -5.29 eV ( e.g. , P2 , P5 , P6 , and P8 ). Thus , by replacing S atoms with Se atoms , the HOMO energy levels increased slightly , while those of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( LUMOs ) decreased slightly. The narrowing of the band gap arose mainly through the electron - stabilizing effect of the selenophene moieties because Se is a more polarizable atom than either an S or O atom. Theoretical Calculation. We used density functional theory ( DFT ) to calculate the geometrical structures and absorption spectra of two repeating units ( dimer - like structure ) of each of the eight polymers ( Scheme 1 ). We replaced all of the side - chain substituents ( C 8 H 17 and EH ) of the polymer units with CH 3 groups for computational simplification , presumably with minor effects on the electronic properties. Geometric optimization of these molecules was performed at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d) 75,76 level using the Gaussian 09 simulation package , 77 with vibrational analysis undertaken at the same level to ensure no negative frequencies. Only the lowest energy conformations are reported herein. We also calculated the frontier molecular orbitals ( HOMO , LUMO ) at the same level of theory. We investigated the electronic nature of the absorption bands through TDDFT 78 calculations at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d) level in vacuo media , up to 10 excited states. Table S1 summarizes the main geometric parameters for the ground states in terms of various dihedral angles in the main backbones and side chains.

In the case of Se substitution in both the π-bridge and the BS acceptor unit , the dihedral angles in the polymers P5 and P8 increased slightly ( to 7.5 ° ) relative to that ( 6.9 ° ) in the unsubstituted polymer PBDTTTBO. Particularly , when we substituted Se atoms in the π-bridge on both sides of the BS units , giving the polymers P3 and P7 , the torsion angle decreased by 1.3 ° relative to P1. Finally , for the polymer P4 , in which the Se atoms appeared only on the side chains , we calculated no change in the dihedral angle in the main backbone. Indeed , for all the polymers with Se atoms substituted into the side chain thiophene units , the torsion angles remained unchanged. Next , we investigated the changes that occurred upon substituting Se atoms into various groups in the two repeating units of PBDTTTBO ( P1 ) and examined the properties of the frontier orbitals ; Table S2 lists the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the HOMO-LUMO gaps ( HLGs ) calculated at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d) level. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P1 were -4.82 and -2.71 eV , respectively , giving an HLG of 2.11 eV. Substitution with Se atoms in the BS acceptor units of the π-bridges of polymers P2 , P5 , P6 , and P8 increased the energies of the HOMOs by 0.15 eV relative to that of P1 ; notably , the LUMO energy levels of polymers P2 and P6 increased by 0.04 eV , while those of P5 and P8 remained unchanged. Accordingly , the HLGs for these four polymers decreased considerably ( by ca. 0.18 eV ). After substituting Se atoms on both sides of the BS units in the π-bridges of the polymers P3 and P7 , the HOMO and LUMO energy levels increased slightly , to -4.79 and -2.75 eV , respectively.

Table S1 also displays the frontier molecular orbitals ( FMOs ) , the HOMOs and LUMOs , of the P1-P8 dimers , calculated at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d) level.

Electronic Absorption Spectra. We used quantum - chemical calculations to analyze the absorption spectra and the nature of the electronic transitions for each of the eight polymers. We calculated the electronic absorption properties using the TD - DFT method at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d) level. From these calculations , we predicted ( Table S2 ) the absorption wavelengths ( λ abs ) , oscillator strengths ( f ) , and ground state dipole moments ( μ g ) and their transitions , along with the ground - toexcited state transition dipole moments ( μ ge ). In the case of the unsubstituted polymer PBDTTTBO ( P1 ) , the absorption maximum appeared near 684 nm with an oscillator strength of 2.116 ; its S^0 → S^1 transition resulted mainly from the HOMO → LUMO transition , which contributed more than 96% . For all of the polymers , the S^2 state was contributed mainly by the H → L + 1 configuration with a low oscillator strength. The ground state dipole moments for all the molecules were less than 1.0 D. The calculated transition dipole moment ( μ ge ) for P1 was 16.58 D. Our results reveal that the ground - to - excited state transition dipole moments for all of these molecules , based on the Cartesian coordinate system , were oriented in the XY - plane , with charge transfer being dominant mainly on the X-axis and perpendicular to the dipole moments , lying on the backbones of the molecules. After substituting Se atoms in the BS acceptor units of P2 and P6 and in both the π-bridge and BS groups of P5 and P8 , the absorption maxima ( λ abs ) increased by approximately 51 and 78 nm , respectively , relative to that in the unsubstituted PBDTTTBO ( P1 ). These four polymers ( P2 , P5 , P6 , P8 ) have high torsional angles , significantly smaller oscillator strengths ( ca. 1.5 ) , and lower transition dipole moments when compared with those of P1. In the polymers P3 and P7 , the substitutions with Se atoms in the π-bridges led to increased conjugation and , thus , an increase in the absorption maxima ( λ abs ) by 22 nm , relative to that of P1. These two polymers have high transition dipole moments ( μ ge = 18.51 D ) and high oscillator strengths ( ca. 2.287 ). According to our calculations , Se atom substitutions in the side chains of the polymer P4 had no effect on its dihedral angles or HOMO / LUMO energy levels , but the oscillator strengths and transition dipoles did increase.",

The highest FF was that of the device incorporating PBDTSTBO ( P4 ) in the active layer , most likely as a result of its high hole mobility. In the 2D GIWAX images of the polymer P4 in Figure 7 , we observe evidence for strong π-π stacking [ d(010) = 3.63 Å ] along the out - of - plane direction , indicating an isotropic structure with a slight preference for the face-on orientation. In contrast , the image for PBDTSSBS ( P8 ) suggested an ordered structure with arc - shaped lamellar scattering [ d(100) = 18.9 Å ] and a π-π stacking [ d(010) = 3.91 Å ] along the out - of - plane direction , indicating both faceon and edge-on orientations. Such a face-on orientation enhances vertical charge carrier transport in PSC devices. 80-82 When exploring the decisive factors affecting the efficiencies of PSCs , we must consider not only the absorption behavior and energy levels of the polymers but also the surface morphologies of their blends. Figure 8 displays the surface morphologies of our blend systems , determined using AFM. We prepared samples of these polymer / PC71BM blends using a More than 10 devices were fabricated. The effect of the molecular weight of the polymers on their photovoltaic performances depends on whether the numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) reaches their critical values. For some polymers that have M n between 2 and 30 kg mol^-1 , the PCEs of the BHJ solar cells can have large variations from 1.2 to 5.9% as reported in the literature. 83,84 When the M n of the polymers is larger than 30 kg mol^-1 , the effect of the molecular weight on the PCEs of the BHJ solar cells is minimized ; in fact , much higher M n results in a slight decrease in the PCEs of the BHJ solar cells such as in the case of the PTzBT-14HD polymers. 85 For understanding the effect of the molecular weight of our synthesized polymers on their photovoltaic devices ' performances , we chose P4 , which has the highest M n among the molecular weights of these 2-D conjugated Se - atomsubstituted polymers , for varying its molecular weight for comparing the resulting devices ' photovoltaic properties.

To explore the potential of the Se - substituted polymers as efficient active materials in solar cells , we systematically investigated the influence of the different Se - substitution patterns on the structural , optical , electrochemical , and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. Mobility measurements , morphological studies , quantumchemical calculations , and grazing - incidence X-ray diffraction patterns have provided us with a greater insight into the different behavior of the polymers. Through rational structural modification of the 2-D conjugated Se - substituted polymers , the resulting power conversion efficiency could vary over 3-fold ( from 2.4 to 7.6% ) , highlighting the importance of careful selection of appropriate chemical structures when designing efficient D-π-A polymers for use in solar cells.

    "sentence": "A novel alcohol - soluble n - type conjugated polyelectrolyte ( n-CPE ) poly-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-alt-2,5-bis [6-(N,N,N-trimethylammonium)hexyl]-3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione ( PDPPNBr ) is synthesized for applications as an electron transport layer ( ETL ) in an inverted polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) device. Because of the electron - deficient nature of diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) backbone and its planar structure , PDPPNBr is endowed with high conductivity and electron mobility. The interfacial dipole moment created by n-CPE PDPPNBr can substantially reduce the work function of ITO and induce a better energy alignment in the device , facilitating electron extraction and decreasing exctions recombination at active layer / cathode interface. As a result , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the inverted devices based poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl-C 61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) active layer with PDPPNBr as ETL achieves a value of 4.03% , with 25% improvement than that of the control device with ZnO ETL. Moreover , the universal PDPPNBr ETL also delivers a notable PCE of 8.02% in the devices based on polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene ( PTB7 ) : (6,6)-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ). To our best knowledge , this is the first time that n - type conjugated polyelectrolyte - based cathode interlayer is reported. Quite different from the traditional p - type conjugated and nonconjugated polyelectrolytes ETLs , n-CPE PDPPNBr as ETL could function efficiently with a thickness approximate 30 nm because of the high conductivity and electron mobility. Furthermore , the PDPPNBr interlayer also can ensure the device with the improved long - term stability. The successful application of this alcohol solution processed n - type conjugated polyelectrolyte indicates that the electron - deficient planar structure with high electron mobility could be very promising in developing high performance and environmentally friendly polymer solar cells . Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer cells ( PSCs ) have achieved tremendous progress in the past decade due to their advantages such as low - cost manufacturing , mechanical flexibility , and easy fabrication for large - scale production. 1-5 Recently , the power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) of the state - of - the - art devices have already exceeded 10% . 6-11 Especially , the so - called inverted structure PSCs are of particular interest for the superior efficiency and stability compared with the conventional devices. For the inverted PSCs , the BHJ active layer is coated between the bottom cathode of indium tin oxide ( ITO ) and top anode of a high work function ( WF ) metal ( Ag or Au ). To obtain a more brilliant performance , the most common and successful strategy is developing an original photoactive layer material and fabricating a desirable device structure. Nevertheless , the interface engineering in the device also plays a significant role for a breakup in the superior efficiency and stability.",

    "sentence": "An excellent interlayer can not only build a tunable energy level alignment between the contact interface to facilitate the charge extraction and transportation but also promote interfacial stability for a high - efficiency and stable device eventually. 17,18 In the inverted devices , the inorganic metal oxides such as titanium oxide ( TiO x ) or zinc oxide ( ZnO ) have always been incorporated as cathode interlayers or electron transport layers ( ETLs ) to modify ITO cathode due to their high charge mobility and electron selective properties. 19,20 However , these inorganic ETLs are not well compatible with the organic active layer. Moreover , most of them typically require a hightemperature annealing process to yield high charge carrier mobility , which do not meet with the high throughput roll - to - roll manufacturing techniques for commercial application. In order to overcome the weakness of the inorganic metal oxides , a series of organic interlayer materials have already been explored , including small molecule - based organic interlayers and polymer - based organic interlayers. The successful smallmolecular interlayers are the fullerene derivatives , perylenediimide salt , and so on. 21,22 However , it is limited due to the difficulty of product purification and an unfavorable film of the interlayer. The typical polymer - based interlayers are mainly polyelectrolytes ( PEs ) , such as poly [ (9,9-bis(3′-(N,Ndimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene ( PFN ) and polyethylenimine ethoxylated ( PEIE ) , which have been paid more attention for the reasons of good film forming properties and easy to preparation. 11,23-25 It has been reported the PEs were introduced as interlayers to afford remarkable performance improvement in the PSCs , and the power conversion has broken through 10% . 26 The ionic or polar pendant groups of the PEs side chain render the conjugated polymers soluble in water , methanol , dimethylformamide , and other polar solvents , which can efficiently avoid the erosion from the active layer dissolved in the chlorinated solvents. More importantly , the different polar groups in these PEs can form a strong interfacial dipole moments in the cathode interface , resulting in a shift of the vacuum level at the PE / cathode interface and an adjusted work function of cathode electrodes ( such as Cu , Ag , and Au ). Therefore , electron transport and injection from the active layer to the cathode can be effectively regulated. 27,28 However , the present research about the PEs mainly focuses on the pendent polar groups but neglects the influence of PEs backbone on the characteristics of the interlayer materials. What is more , most of reported PEs are based on ptype conjugated or nonconjugated polymer backbones , such as polythiophenes , polyfluorenes , polycarbazoles , and polyethylenimine.",

    "sentence": "29-32 Theoretically , these p - type conjugated or nonconjugate backbone as ETLs would hamper the electron extraction and transportation , so that the thickness of these PEs interlayers is extremely limited to only a few nanometers ( usually less than 10 nm ) , 33 which is not helpful to high throughput commercial application in the near future. Although metal - containing conjugated polymers interlayer , e.g. PFEN-Hg , with a thickness ∼ 20 nm demonstrated a good device performance , the toxic metal Hg has been incorporated. 34 In this study , we concentrate in the PEs backbone to design and synthesize a novel n - type conjugated polyelectrolyte ( n-CPE ) poly-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo [ 3,4- c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-alt-2,5-bis-[6-(N,N,N- trimethylammonium)hexyl]-3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-pyrrolo- [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( PDPPNBr ) ( Scheme 1 ). We find that the feature of the conjugated backbone of the polyelectrolyte has a significant impact on the properties. Because of the electrondeficient nature and strong interactions of diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) backbone , this novel n-CPE shows high conductivity and electron mobility. 35 Moreover , the introduced ammonium salt polar pendant groups in the n-CPE PDPPNBr can not only create favorable dipole moments to provide better energy alignment in solar cells but also endow n-CPE PDPPNBr with good solubility in methanol and other environmentally friendly solvents. Subsequently , the n-CPE PDPPNBr as ETL has been successfully applied in the inverted device with a structure of ITO / n-CPE / P3HT:PC61BM / MoO 3 / Ag , and a desirable PCE of 4.03% is obtained , which is about 24% enhancement than the value obtained from the control device with ZnO ETL. Replacing the active layer with the low - bandgap donor polythieno [3,4-b]thiophene-co-benzodithiophene ( PTB7 ) and acceptor [6,6]phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) , a prominent PCE as high as 8.02% is achieved. It is worthy to note that this is the first time that n - type conjugated polyelectrolyte - based interlayer is reported. Inspiringly , quite different from p - type conjugated or nonconjugated PEs , the high electron mobility and conductivity benefitted from the n - type feature and solid - state packing can effectively alleviate the thickness limitation and make PDPPNBr capable of functioning efficiently in a wide thickness range of 6 to ∼ 30 nm. This characteristic of the solution processed n-CPE ETL provides the feasibility of large - area rollto - roll manufacturing techniques. Additionally , the PDPPNBr interlayer also can ensure the device with an improved long - term stability. These findings indicate this unprecedented alcoholsoluble n - type CPE could be a desirable candidate for the interfacial layer materials in highly efficient and stable PSCs . The synthesis and structure of the n - type conjugated polyelectrolyte PDPPNBr are shown in Scheme 1 ( synthesis details are provided in the Supporting Information ). Compound 1 reacted with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxoborolane to afford DPP - based compound 2. Then , the copolymer PDPPBr was first prepared by the Suzuki coupling polymerization between compounds 2 and 3.",

The final dark - purple solid was easily soluble in the common organic solvents such as chloroform , chlorobenzene , and toluene at room temperature. The ionized copolymer PDPPNBr was obtained through an almost quantitative quaternization by treating the copolymer with a trimethylamine in tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) solutions at low temperature. 24,36 Because of the existence of the ammonium salt polar pendant groups , the resulted n-CPE PDPPNBr can be readily dissolved in polar solvents including methanol , dimethylformamide ( DMF ) , and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ). The comparison photographs of the copolymer PDPPBr and its corresponding n-CPE PDPPNBr dissolved in methanol solution are shown in Figure 1. It can be observed that the copolymer PDPPBr presents a large amount of precipitate at the bottom of the bottle , while the n-CPE PDPPNBr shows a clearly blue methanol solution , thanks to the ammonium salt polar groups. In addition , all the intermediates and final product have been thoroughly purified , and the chemical structures of the products were characterized by spectroscopic methods , from which satisfactory analysis data were obtained ( for the corresponding 1H NMR and 13 °C NMR of the intermediates and final product see the Experimental Section in Figures S1-S3 of the Supporting Information ). The ultraviolet - visible ( UV - vis ) absorption spectra of the copolymer PDPPBr and the conjugated polyelectrolyte PDPPNBr in solution and solid states are shown in Figure 1. Owing to the same backbone of PDPPBr and PDPPNBr , the copolymer and conjugated polyelectrolyte solutions maintain similar absorption bands. However , the maximum absorption wavelength ( λ max ) of both thin films displays an obvious red - shift ( ∼ 150 nm ) relative to that of their corresponding solutions , resulting from intermolecular interactions of the diketopyrrolopyrrole backbone favoring the strong solid - state packing. The frontier molecular orbital energy of copolymer PDPPBr and the conjugated polyelectrolyte PDPPNBr was calculated from the cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) , which is presented in Figure S4. Based on the reduction potential ( -0.78 eV ) and the oxidation potential ( 0.75 eV ) , the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) and the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of PDPPNBr are estimated to be -3.62 and -5.15 eV , respectively. The physiochemical properties of the copolymer are summarized in Table S1. The energy levels are well consistent with density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations with the Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP / 6-31g(d) level for copolymer PDPPBr , as shown in Figure S5. After optimizing the geometrical structures with a fixed repeating structure , the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are -4.89 and -2.96 eV , respectively. Furthermore , the torsion angle between the two thiophene rings is only 6 ° tilted from the planar geometry , which would be in favor of the charge transfer.",

    "sentence": "37,38 The polar side chain in the polyelectrolyte is preferable to form an aligned dipole moment at metal / organic material interface , which can modify the work function ( WF ) of the electrode by inducing a vacuum - level shift. 39 To characterize the WF change of PDPPNBr - modified ITO electrode , ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( UPS ) was carried out. A thin layer of PDPPNBr with a thickness of approximately 12 nm was deposited on the ITO substrate. As shown in Figure 2a , the bare ITO exhibits a typical WF value of 4.84 eV , in accordance with the literature , 17 while the WF moves to 4.12 eV by 0.72 eV shift when ITO is modified with PDPPNBr. Upon deposition of PDPPNBr on ITO , the negative bromide counterions tend to be located near the hydrophilic ITO , whereas the hydrophobic conjugated polymer backbone preferentially locates on the surface ( as shown schematically in Figure 2b ) , 39,40 which would spontaneously give rise to the formation of interfacial dipole at the ITO / PDPPNBr interface. The dipole moment pointing away from the ITO surface to active layer makes the substantial reduction of WF through the swift down of the vacuum level ( E vac ) of the substrates closer to that of the active layer. Consequently , the interfacial dipole formation at ITO / PDPPNBr interface can lower the Schottky barrier and favor a better energy alignment to facilitate the electron injection and transport from the photoharvest layer to ITO. In order to further confirm the electronic property variation obtained from the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy , the Kelvin probe method was employed to determine the work function of ITO / PDPPNBr , and result of the commonly efficient 19 deposited on ITO substrate ) was also presented for comparison. Figure 2c demonstrates that the bare ITO and the reference ITO / ZnO exhibit the work function value of -4.70 and -4.41 eV , respectively , in agreement with the literature. 17 Coating a layer of PDPPNBr on ITO leads to a remarkable reduction of WF compared with the bare ITO ( -4.25 eV vs -4.70 eV ). Note that the WF of ITO / PDPPNBr is even lower than that of ITO / ZnO ( -4.25 eV vs -4.41 eV ). The reduced WF of ITO / PDPPNBr is very close to the LUMOs of PC61BM and PC71BM , which can form an ohmic contact with the active layer and smoothly transport the electrons from fullerene acceptor to the ITO cathode ( Figure 2d ). Figure S6 displays the hydrophilic alteration of bare ITO , ITO / ZnO , and ITO / PDPPNBr. The bare ITO exhibits a water contact angle of ca. 73 ° . After a layer of the so - gel ZnO nanoparticles spin - coated on the ITO , the contact angle to deionized water of ITO / ZnO decreases to ca. 60 ° .",

    "sentence": "Replacing the ZnO to PDPPNBr leads to the surface of ITO / PDPPNBr with an increased water contact angle of ca. 89 ° . The more hydrophobic surface of ITO / PDPPNBr again gives a direct proof to verify that the negative bromide counterions tend to locate at the hydrophilic ITO , whereas the hydrophobic conjugated polymer backbone preferentially locates at the side of organic active layer ( Figure 2b ). The increased hydrophobic surface of ITO / PDPPNBr allows for the more imitated contact with upper active layer. Moreover , the calculated surface energy of ITO / PDPPNBr ( 30.67 mN / m ) is closer to PC61BM and PC71BM ( 28.1 mN / m ) than P3HT ( 23.8 mN / m ) , which would be beneficial to a vertical phase separation of the active layer. 42 Additionally , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was also employed to determine the morphology of the bare ITO , ITO / ZnO , and ITO / PDPPNBr. As shown in Figure 3 , the bare ITO exhibits a roughness root-mean-square ( rms ) of 3.29 nm. After being spin - coated with a thin layer ZnO nanoparticles , the surface becomes smoother with a decreased rms of 1.23 nm , while upon deposition of the PDPPNBr on ITO substrate , a relatively rougher surface with a rms of 3.59 nm is obtained. Since the surface wettability and morphology of electrode have been altered by covering a layer of PDPPNBr , it is expected to influence the deposition of the active layer. Thereby , AFM was conducted to investigate the morphology of active layer deposited on bare ITO , ITO / ZnO , and ITO / PDPPNBr. The P3HT:PC61BM active layer was spin - coated on these substrates and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. Seen from the images in Figure 3 , the P3HT:PC61BM deposited on bare ITO and ITO / ZnO substrates exhibits a roughness rms of 3.1 and 1.8 nm , respectively. It is worthy to note that the PFN , a well - known interlayer for state - of - art PSCs , is not suitable for P3HT:PC61BM devices due to the poor compatibility between interlayer and active layer. Delightfully , deposition of P3HT:PC61BM on the ITO / PDPPNBr develops a robust and uniform film with a roughness rms of 4.3 nm , suggesting a good contact of ITO / PDPPNBr with P3HT:PC61BM. The difference in roughness of P3HT:PC61BM is caused from the morphology variation of the substrates. It has been reported a rougher surface of the active layer would facilitate the interfacial adhesion between subsequent hole extraction layer and the active layer ; therefore , an improved charge transport can be anticipated. 43,44 In addition , a uniform microphase separation of P3HT:PC61BM is well developed on the ITO / PDPPNBr substrate , which would be very helpful for charge separation and transportation.

The best PCE of 4.03% , together with an open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.65 V , a short circuit current density ( J sc ) of 8.95 mA / cm^2 , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 69.29% , is achieved from the device based on PDPPNBr with an optimized thickness of ∼ 12 nm ( Figure 5a ). The device with the ultrathin PDPPNBr cathode interlayer ( 6 nm ) delivers the lowest PCE of 2.9% , presumably due to the incompletely covered interlayer on the ITO electrode. More intriguingly , when the thickness of PDPPNBr increases to 20 and 29 nm , the PCEs of the devices still remain at the high values of 3.68% and 3.41% , respectively. As we all know , most polyelectrolytes ( usually based on p - type conjugated or nonconjugated backbone ) as interlayers are very sensitive to the thickness , and the thickness limitation is always less than 10 nm. For instance , the optimized thickness of the well - known cathode interlayer PFN is found to be 5-6 nm , 33 and further increasing the interlayer thickness results in a sharply decreased device efficiency. This is because the p - type conjugated or nonconjugated backbone is not beneficial for electron transport ; therefore , the electron extraction from active layer to cathode mainly relies on the electron tunneling effect. 45 In order to further confirm this opinion , the control device based nonconjugated polyelectrolyte polyethylenimine ethoxylated ( PEIE ) ETL was fabricated ; the contrastive parameters are shown in Table S2. It is obvious that the PEIE could also tune the interface energy alignment so that a superior V oc was obtained , whereas the inferior J sc was probably caused by the nonconjugated backbone with a poor conductivity. Additionally , increasing the interlayer thickness will inevitably increase the bulk resistance of the interlayer , consequently leading to the sharply decreased electron extraction and transportation. For the PDPPNBr ETL , when the thickness increases from 6 to 29 nm , the series resistance ( R s ) only slightly increases from 1.95 to 13.28 Ω cm^2.",

    "sentence": "To explore the reason behind the unique PDPPNBr ETL , the electron mobility of PDPPNBr in the solar cell devices is estimated using the space - charge limited current ( SCLC ) method according to the Mott - Gurney equation. 46-48 As plotted in Figure 5b , the device with bare ITO shows an electron mobility of 2.08 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . After incorporation of PDPPNBr as ETL , the electron mobility is remarkably enhanced to 5.70 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which is even higher than that of ZnO ETL ( 3.78 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) ( Table S2 ). In addition , the conductivity of the ZnO and PDPPNBr interlayer was also investigated and compared. As shown in Figure 5c , PDPPNBr displays more superior conductivity over ZnO ( 9.98 × 10^-6 S cm^-1 vs 7.89 × 10^-6 S cm^-1 ) , and its conductivity is even 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of PFN interlayer ( 6.9 × 10^-9 S cm^-1 ). 49 The high electron mobility and conductivity of PDPPNBr interlayer mainly originate from the n - type character and the dense packing of planar DPP units , which should be responsible for the highly maintained performance devices with the thick ETL. This novel interlayer could provide the feasibility of large - area roll - to - roll manufacturing techniques. Superiority of the PDPPNBr ETL can be clearly verified by comparing the devices performances with ITO / PDPPNBr , ITO / ZnO , and bare ITO. From Figure 4 and Table 1 we can see that all of the devices with PDPPNBr ETLs show significantly improved PCE than the control device with bare ITO ( 0.85% ) , and PDPPNBr with a thickness of 12 , 20 , and 29 nm even achieves a higher PCE than the widely used ZnO ETL ( 3.24% ). And the highest efficiency obtained from PDPPNBr ( 4.03% ) shows 374% and 24% improvement over those obtained from bare ITO and ZnO interlayers , respectively. The remarkable improvement in PCE is a result of the overall improved V oc ( from 0.37 to 0.65 eV ) , J sc ( from 7.63 to 8.95 mA / cm^2 ) , and FF ( from 30.2% to 69.3% ) , suggesting a more favorable charge injection and collection are achieved at the electrodes. The simultaneously increased V oc and J sc values are related to the better energy alignment induced by the dipole moments created from the PDPPNBr with polar groups , which is in good agreement with the UPS and Kelvin probe observation. As revealed by Table 1 , compared with bare ITO and ITO / ZnO - based devices , incorporation of PDPPNBr ETL into the device can significantly reduce the series resistance ( R s ) and increase the shunt resistance ( R sh ) , indicating a good interfacial modification to boost charge injection and suppress charge recombination.",

    "sentence": "As a result , a distinctly improved J sc and FF are achieved. Moreover , the desirable morphology of the active layer and favorable interface contact observed from AFM and water contact angle measurement should also account for the J sc and FF enhancement. The highest performance promoted by the PDPPNBr ETL can be further elucidated by the most restrained leakage current in the dark J-V curve ( Figure S8 ). The theoretical J sc obtained by integrating the corresponding external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) data ( in Figure 4d ) is also well consistent with the current values from the J-V characteristic. To further confirm and testify the universality of this novel PDPPNBr ETL , the inverted PSCs devices based on the lowbandgap polymer polythieno [3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene ( PTB7 ) as a donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as a acceptor were fabricated. The corresponding J-V characteristics and devices parameters are summarized in Figure 6a and Table 1 , respectively. As expected , with respect to the bare ITO and ZnO modified ITO electrode , the PDPPNBr modified ITO cathode yields the best PCE as high as 8.02% with a V oc of 0.75 V , a J sc of 15.10 , and a FF of 70.8% . Similar to the device with P3HT:PC61BM , the notable efficiency of device with PTB7 : PC71BM is also mainly attributed to the overall improved device parameter , including V oc , J sc , and FF. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) curves of the devices are presented in Figure 6b. It can be seen that the PDPPNBr - based device shows the highest EQE value , in accordance with the values obtained from the J-V characteristics in Figure 6a. Table 1 demonstrates that all of the PDPPNBr - based devices show the dropped R s and enhanced R sh than the bare ITO and ITO / ZnO - based devices , regardless of the active layer. It can be concluded that incorporation of PDPPNBr ETL into the devices can significantly improve charge injection and suppress charge recombination. To gain deeper insight into the influence of PDPPNBr interlayer on the recombination mechanism in the devices , an additional measurement with respect to the V oc and J sc of the ZnO and PDPPNBr based devices at various light intensities from 23 to 100 mW cm^-2 was carried out. In conclusion , a novel alcohol - soluble conjugated polyelectrolyte PDPPNBr based on n - type backbone is first synthesized and applied as ETL in high performance PSCs. The feature of the conjugated backbone of the polyelectrolyte has significantly impact on the properties. The planar DPP backbone with n - type nature endows the PDPPNBr with high conductivity and electron mobility. The interfacial dipole moment created by n-CPE PDPPNBr can substantially reduce the work function of ITO and induce a better energy alignment in the device , facilitating electron extraction and decreasing exctions recombination at active layer / cathode interface.",

    "sentence": "Recently , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted considerable attention because of their unique advantages , which include low cost , lightweight , solution processability , and flexibility. Thus , enormous effort has been focused on improving the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of PSCs for future commercial applications. 1-8 To date , highly efficient PSCs based on poly-(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) as the electron - donor material and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) as the acceptor have been reported with a power conversion efficiency of 4-5 % . 9,10 One of the main factors limiting the performance of PSCs is the mismatch of their absorption to the terrestrial solar spectrum. Recently , several studies on low - band gap conjugated polymers have been pursued in order to match the absorption spectrum of the active layer to the solar spectrum. 11-13 The most successful approach to achieving low - band gap polymers is a copolymerized donor-acceptor structure. Copolymerization of the donor , with a higher HOMO ( highest occupied molecular orbital ) energy level , and the acceptor , with a lower LUMO ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) energy level , results in a lower band gap polymer due to an intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) from the donor to the acceptor. 14,15 Another approach to designing low - band gap conjugated polymers is the introduction of electron - releasing effects , such as long flexible alkyl and alkoxy chains , to increase the conjugation length. 16,17 However , pendant chains can give rise to affect steric interactions and the coplanarity of the polymer backbone , resulting in a change of the optical and electrochemical properties of the donor-acceptor polymers. Among the various conjugated polymers , polyfluorene and polycarbazole derivatives have deep HOMO levels that increase the open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of the PSCs. 18,19 Recently , Leclerc et al. reported a systematic study of PSCs using various poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives. In that work , the researchers varied the electron - withdrawing unit of the polymers. 20,21 Poly[N-9 00 -heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4 0 ,7 0 -di-2-thienyl-2 0 ,1 0 ,3 0 -benzothiadiazole ) ( PCDTBT ) and PC61BM composites provide a promising efficiency of 3.6% . Further optimization of the device for PCDTBT led to a PCE of 6.1% . 6 However , all these polymers , except for PCDTBT , show hole - mobility values between 10^-5 and 10^-4 cm^2 / ( V s ) in organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) , resulting in a low power - conversion efficiency of 1-2 % .",

We describe the effect of modifying the alkyl group of the side chain of the quinoxaline derivatives on the electronic and optoelectronic properties of the polymers. The field - effect hole mobility as well as the electronic energy levels and processability of the materials for PSC applications were investigated. Among the studied quinoxaline - based copolymers , P2 showed the best photovoltaic performance with an open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.82 V , a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) of 9.96 mA / cm^2 , a fill factor ( FF ) of 0.49 , and a power - conversion efficiency of 4.0% when a P2 / PC71BM blend film was used as the active layer under AM 1.5 G irradiation ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). 7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(5 0 ,8 0 -di-2-thienyl-2,3-bis(4-octyloxyl)phenyl)quinoxaline ] ( P2 ) , and poly[N-9 00 -heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(5 0 ,8 0 -di-2-thienyl-2,3-bis(4-(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline ] ( P3 ) , which have the same polymer backbone but different side chains , were studied in order to achieve a higher efficiency value and investigate the side - chain effect. Actually , the synthesis and solar cell devices of the polymer called P1 has actually been published earlier , 21 and P1 was synthesized for the purpose of direct comparison. Although the backbone of the copolymers with similar structure have been described in the literature except differences in the solubilizing side chains , 22-25 the effect of the alkoxy side chains on the electronic , optoelectronic , and photovoltaic properties has not been reported for PSCs based on polymers with quinoxaline units. Compared to P1 , the alkoxy side chains on the quinoxaline units , which have been used earlier in other polymers for solar cells , 26 can enhance the solubility and the charge transfer to electron acceptors such as PCBM. In general , bulky side chains have a negative effect on the carrier mobility , since interchain hopping of carriers requires a favorable overlapping of the electron wave function of adjacent conjugated units on the polymer main chains. 27 Therefore , from the viewpoint of π-π* stacking , the quinoxaline-(Qx-) based copolymers with different side chains were designed and synthesized. We systematically investigated the synthesis , thermal stability , optical and electrochemical properties , field - effect carrier mobilities , and photovoltaic characteristics of the resulting polymers. Our results provide valuable information on the relationship between polymer design at the molecular level and its electrical performance in field - effect transistors ( FETs ) and polymer solar cells .",

All the polymers exhibited a good thermal stability , showing less than 5% weight loss at temperatures up to 400 ° C. Compared to P1 , P2 and P3 have a lower glass transition temperature ( T g ) , which is attributed to the alkoxy side chains on the quinoxaline units. The physical properties of the polymers are summarized in Table 1. Optical Properties. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform and in the spin - cast film are shown in Figures 1 and 2 , respectively , and the corresponding absorption properties are summarized in Table 2. Both in solution and in the films , the polymers exhibited two distinct absorption bands : one at about 375-400 nm and the other one in the range : 495-545 nm. The nature of these bands , observed for the low - band gap polymer with push-pull units , still remains to be elucidated. Jesperson et al. attributed the highest energy band to a π-π* transition whereas the lowest energy band was assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the donor and the acceptor. 28,29 To obtain further information about the ICT electronic structure of the polymers , we carried out density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations for the model compound using the DMol 3 software. Figure S1 ( Supporting Information ) shows the calculated molecular orbitals of the model compounds. As shown in Figure S1 , the HOMO was delocalized over the polymer backbone , whereas the LUMO was highly localized on the Qx unit ( Supporting Information ). The red shift observed for P2 and P3 , compared to P1 , is due to the introduction of the benzene groups on the quinoxaline unit and not electron - donating effect of the alkoxy chains on the para position of the benzene rings. The dihedral angle between the benzene rings and the quinoxlaine rings are significant , as can be seen from the calculated structures ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ). However , this result currently lacks a theoretical explanation. The absorption maxima of the polymer films are red - shifted by 25-33 nm compared to those of the polymer solutions. This red - shift indicates higher coplanarity of the polymer and / or enhanced intermolecular electronic interactions in the solid state. The optical band gap obtained from the extrapolation of the absorption edges of the film are in the order of P3(1.91 eV ) < P2(1.97 eV ) < P1(2.01 eV ). The smaller band gap should help improve the absorption efficiency in the solar spectrum. Electrochemical Properties. To determine the energy levels of the HOMO and the LUMO , we investigated the electrochemical properties of the polymers by using cyclic voltammetry ( CV ).",

The CV measurements were carried out in tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate ( TBABF 4 , 0.1 M ) / acetonitrile electrolyte at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere at a scan rate of 50 mV / s. 30 The HOMO level of the polymers can be deduced from the oxidation onsets assuming that the energy level of ferrocene ( Fc ) is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. 31 In the anodic scan , the onset of oxidation for P1 , P2 , and P3 occurred at 0.54 , 0.52 , and 0.50 V , which corresponds to ionization - potential values of -5.34 , -5.32 , and -5.30 eV , respectively ( Figure 3 ). The electrondonating alkoxy groups in P2 and P3 slightly raise the HOMO level and consequently reduce the band gap of the copolymer. Unfortunately , it was difficult to obtain the LUMO energies for the copolymers using this technique , so these values were estimated from the optical band gaps ( taken as the absorption onsets of the UV-vis spectra for the polymer films ) and the HOMO energies. 32 The energies of the LUMO levels of P1 , P2 , and P3 are listed in Table 2. Field - Effect Transistor Characteristics. The effects of the side - chain substitutions on the electrical transport properties of the resulting materials were examined by measuring the fieldeffect properties of each of the three copolymers. The field - effect Scheme 1. Synthetic Scheme for the Monomer and Copolymers carrier mobilities of the polymers were investigated by fabricating thin - film transistors ( TFTs ) with a bottom - contact geometry using Au electrodes. The detailed device - fabrication process is described in the Experimental Section. To reduce the photocurrent loss and obtain high - performance PSC devices , a high charge - carrier mobility ( higher than or close to 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) is necessary. 33,34 Figure S2 ( Supporting Information ) shows plots of drain - source current ( I ds ) as a function of drain - source voltage ( V ds ) at different gate voltages , as well as typical output and transfer curves for the polymers ( Supporting Information ). TFTs of the polymers were found to exhibit typical p-channel TFT characteristics with good drain - current modulation and well - defined linear and saturation regions.",

The higher mobility measured for P2 can be understood in terms of the better solubility and π-π* stacking. 27 The hole mobility determined for P2 is 1 order of magnitude higher than that for P3. We guess that the high mobility of P2 is due to the improved packing of P2 compared to that of polymers containing dimethyloctyloxy chains. The hole mobility of P2 was within the desired range for PSC materials ( i.e. , higher than or close to 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) , allowing for an efficient charge extraction and a good fill factor ( FF ).

    "sentence": "The best PSC performance was observed for P2 / PC71BM devices , which reached a PCE of 4.0% , with a shortcircuit current density ( J SC ) of 9.96 mA / cm^2 , an open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.82 V , and a fill factor ( FF ) of 0.49 under AM 1.5 G irradiation ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). The V OC value is closely related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the electron acceptor , PC71BM. 35 As expected from the HOMO energy levels of the polymers , those polymers with the same backbone units have a similar V OC value because of their almost identical electronic structures. However , the trend of V OC for P1 does not seem to fit the electrochemical potentials , which can be explained in terms of the morphology of the blended film. A low solubility has an impact on the mechanical properties of the film , the interface resistance , and the nanoscale morphology , resulting in a low open - circuit voltage and a low fill factor. 21 Figure 5 shows atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) images ( 1 μm x 1 μm scan area ) of the blend film ( polymer : PC71BM = 1 : 3 ) for a better understanding of the device characteristics. P2 shows homogeneously well - distributed small - sized domains whereas P1 exhibits larger polymer-PC71BM domains and phase separations. These results indicate that P2 may form a well - distributed bicontinuous interpenetrating network of polymer-PC71BM domains , showing good agreement with the improved current-voltage characteristics observed for this system in comparison to the other polymers. The measured short - circuit current ( J SC ) for P1 , P2 , and P3 was 2.70 , 9.96 , and 6.24 mA / cm^2 , respectively. These results are also in good agreement with the OFET measurements. The hole mobility determined in pure P2 is about 1 order of Macromolecules ARTICLE magnitude higher than that obtained with P3 , which could explain the higher value of the short - circuit current measured for P2. Figure 6 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of PSC devices fabricated with P2 / PC71BM and P3 / PC71BM under monochromatic light illumination. In both cases , the EQE spectra agree well with the optical - absorption curves , resulting in a close correlation with the photocurrents. Convolution of the spectral response with the photon flux of the AM 1.5 G spectrum provided an estimate of the value of J SC under irradiation. The calculated J SC value for the P2 - based devices was 8.46 mA / cm^2. Because of the discrepancy between the EQE results and the photon flux under AM 1.5 illumination , an approximate mismatch of 15% was present between the convolution and the solarsimulator data. 36 Although the values of V OC and J SC were high , those of the fill factors were low.",

The thermal , photophysical , electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers were investigated. The two copolymers exhibited relatively low HOMO energy levels of -5.58 eV for PT-Tz-DTBT and -5.59 eV for PT-Tz-DTffBT , respectively. Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells with two as-synthesized copolymers as electron donors and (6,6)-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) as an electron acceptor exhibit power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of 2.63% and 3.75% for PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT , respectively. When PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor , a promising PCE of 3.65% and 4.42% for PT-Tz-DTffBT was achieved by using a conventional and inverted device structure , respectively . Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted considerable attention because of their fascinating potential for low - cost , large - area production through solution processing. 1,2 Recently , a lot of new donor - acceptor ( D-A ) low band gap polymers have been reported for high - performance PSCs. For example , benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene ( BDT ) has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective buildingblocks for developing high performance PSC polymers. The BHJ PSCs based on BDT copolymers have achieved a series of high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) values in the range of 3-8 % . [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] To achieve high efficiency of PSCs , it is well recognized that p - type conjugated polymers should meet the following requirements simultaneously : ( 1 ) good solubility to guarantee solution processability and good miscibility with an electron acceptor material , ( 2 ) deep - lying HOMO energy level for generating high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , 14 ( 3 ) low band gap for broadening absorption spectrum to capture more solar photons , and ( 4 ) high hole mobility for effective charge transport ability. For conventional conjugated polymers , it is hard to match well with all the demands mentioned above. Generally , to obtain a high V oc , one of the most effective approaches is to lower the HOMO energy level of polymer , while too low HOMO value would lead to a wide band gap of the polymer , and in turn reduce the short - circuit current density. To achieve high efficiencies of PSCs , researchers have developed a new family of polymers with conjugated side groups or side chains , which can increase the open - circuit voltage and short - circuit current density at the same time. In our previous research , we designed and synthesized a series of copolymers which contained a BDT group and a thiophene group in the main chain , and DTBT derivatives as the side chains.",

    "sentence": "[14][15][16] Most of those copolymers exhibit high short - circuit current density and PCE. However , to further improve the photovoltaic performance of these sidechain polymers , there are still many efforts to be made. The thiazole ( Tz ) unit was reported to be used for lowering the HOMO energy levels of the BHJ PSCs. 17 Additionally , the incorporation of uorine substituents into the conjugated backbone can noticeably improve all three key device parameters ( V oc , J sc , and FF ) of polymer - based BHJ solar cells. Furthermore , adding the uorine atoms helps improve the morphology and structure of the BHJ lm. And the higher purity , caused by the observed lower miscibility with PCBM when the uorine concentration is increased , likely reduces bimolecular recombination , leading to an improved device function. 18 Here , we report two new conjugated copolymers ( PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT ) ( Fig. 1 ) , which used the thiazole unit to replace the thiophene unit , expecting to get deeper HOMO energy levels and higher open - circuit voltage. Moreover , two uorine atoms were introduced at the 5 and 6 positions of the BT unit to get higher short - circuit current density ( J sc ) and higher FF value. The thermal , photophysical , electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the two copolymers were investigated in detail . The thermal properties of the copolymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min -1 . The two copolymers ( PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT ) have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures ( T d ) corresponding to a 5% weight loss at 342 and 350 °C , respectively , as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Whereas neither phase transition temperatures nor melting peaks of the two copolymers were observed by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ). Obviously , the thermal stability of these copolymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs . The photophysical properties of the copolymers were investigated by UV - vis spectroscopy. The correlative data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 3 and 4 give the UV - vis absorption spectra of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT in diluted CHCl 3 solution and in the lm states. The two copolymers show two distinct absorption bands. The rst absorption bands with the absorption maxima ( l s,max ) at 381 nm for PT-Tz-DTBT and 387 nm for PT-Tz-DTffBT can be identied with a delocalized excitonic p-p* transition. The second absorption bands with l s,max at 510 and 513 nm , respectively , can be attributed to a localized transition between donoracceptor charge transfer states. 22,23 PT-Tz-DTffBT exhibits a slightly broader absorption which is derived from the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) interaction between the main chain and the conjugated side chains. 24 Obviously , the ICT interactions of PT-Tz-DTffBT are progressively enhanced due to the increase of the electron affinity of the DTffBT group.",

The absorption coefficient of PT-Tz-DTffBT is higher than that of PT-Tz-DTBT due to the introduction of uorine atoms to the side group. In comparison with the absorption spectra of the polymer solutions , the absorption spectra of the lms are broadened. The absorption peaks are red - shied. This phenomenon might result from the enhanced interchain interaction in the solid lms , which is probably related to the increased extent of p-p stacking of the backbones and increased polarizability of the lm. 16,26,27 The optical band gaps ( E opt g ) of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT are 1.91 and 1.92 eV , respectively , calculated from the onset of the lm absorptions . The electrochemical behavior of the copolymers was investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). The corresponding CV curves and data of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT lms are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2. The redox potentials were referenced to the ferrocene / ferrocenium redox couple ( Fc / Fc + ). The redox potential of Fc / Fc + was assumed to have an absolute energy level of 4.8 eV in a vacuum. 28 The redox potential of ferrocene is 0.71 V vs. SCE. On the basis of 4.8 eV below vacuum for the energy level of Fc / Fc+ , the HOMO / LUMO energy levels and electrochemical energy gaps ( E ec g ) of copolymers were calculated according to the following equations : E ec g = e(E ox - E red ) ( eV ) The onset potentials for oxidation ( E ox ) are observed to be 1.49 and 1.50 V for PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT , respectively. The HOMO energy levels of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT were at -5.58 eV and -5.59 eV , respectively. It has been demonstrated that the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) value in BHJ solar cells is linearly dependent on the difference between the HOMO level of the p - type polymer and the LUMO level of an n - type PC61BM. 29 The two conjugated copolymers with side - chains show a similar HOMO energy level , which predicts that they would achieve a similar V oc value to the resulting PSCs. Besides , two copolymers exhibit deeper - lying HOMO energy levels than -5.20 eV , indicating their good air stability under ambient conditions. 30 The relatively deep - lying HOMO energy levels of the two copolymers may be due to the introduction of the thiazole unit in the backbone , which also contributes to the lower HOMO energy levels of the two copolymers , compared with our reported research.",

The charge carrier transport properties of conjugated polymers play a key role in the performance of PSCs. To understand the inuence of charge carrier mobility of the copolymers / PC61BM blend lms on the photovoltaic properties , the hole mobility of the target copolymers was measured by using a space charge limit current ( SCLC ) method. Hole - only devices were fabricated with the conguration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 30 nm ) / Polymer : PC61BM / MoO 3 ( 10 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ).

The hole mobility of PT-Tz-DTffBT increases due to the uorine substituent , from the DTBT unit to the DTffBT unit. And the noticeable increase of hole mobility by the uorine substitution may contribute to the enhancement of J sc ( 7.75 - 9.05 mA cm^-2 ) and FF ( 0.45 - 0.54 ) ( see below ). In short , the hole mobilities of the two copolymers are relatively high , which is one of the reasons that we obtain the high power conversion efficiencies .

    "sentence": "Fig. 6 shows the best J-V curves of the devices under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . The photovoltaic parameters , including the short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , the ll factor ( FF ) , and the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) , are summarized in Table 3. Note that PSCs based on PT-Tz-DTffBT demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than PT-Tz-DTBT , with a PCE of 3.75% . In comparison with PT-Tz-DTBT , PT-Tz-DTffBT shows a higher J sc of 9.05 mA cm^-2 , which is consistent with the IPCE spectrum. Notably , the copolymer PT-Tz-DTffBT which contains two uorine atoms in the side group has the higher PCE value than PT-Tz-DTBT , which is due to the increase of the FF value and J sc value , which can also be ascribed to the increase of the hole mobility. For other testing conditions , we found no further improvement by using 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) as the additive. In addition , the photovoltaic properties of PT-Tz-DTffBT were investigated in BHJ solar cells using PC71BM as the acceptor. We obtain the power conversion efficiency of 3.65% ( J sc = 8.92 mA cm^-2 , V oc = 0.80 V , FF = 0.51 ). Although the open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) improved from 0.76 V to 0.80 V , both J sc and FF decreased , so the PCE of PT-Tz-DTffBT has no further improvement ( Table 3 ). In order to better understand the device characteristics , we have also fabricated an inverted PSC with the device structure of ITO / TIPD ( 12 nm ) / PT-Tz-DTffBT:PC71BM ( x 100 nm ) ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) / MoO 3 ( 24 nm ) / Al ( 100 nm ). A high PCE of 4.42% has been demonstrated , with the highest J sc of 10.11 mA cm^-2 , the highest V oc of 0.88 V , and a FF of 0.50 ( Table 3 ). Obviously , the enhanced PCE beneted from the improvement in J sc and V oc , which were attributed to the reduced photodegradation of the copolymer active layer presumably. 35 It is noteworthy that the PCE improved signicantly from 2.63% of PT-Tz-DTBT to 3.75% of PT-Tz-DTffBT. This can account for the obvious increase in J sc as revealed by incidentphoton - to - current efficiency ( IPCE ) spectra ( Fig. 7 ) which may result from the better charge transfer and the decrease of electron aggregation by improving the miscibility between PT-Tz-DTffBT and PC61BM. As we know , the FF value is mainly determined by lm morphology. The better morphology of the copolymers could be benecial to a higher FF. Fig. 8 shows the surface morphology of the active layers of copolymer : PC61BM ( 1 : 2 w / w ) in AFM height images and phase images.",

    "sentence": "As is clearly evidenced by AFM height images ( Fig. 8a and b ) , the PT-Tz-DTffBT lm displays a smooth and featureless image over the 3 x 3 mm 2 scan area , suggesting a relatively homogeneous morphology , that obviously precedes the image of PT-Tz-DTBT. From phase images ( Fig. 8c and d ) of the two copolymers PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT , we can see that introducing the uorine atoms to the side group promoted phase separation. In short , by introducing the uorine atoms to the side group , the FF and J sc values of PT-Tz-DTffBT were enhanced , which was correlated with their morphology and hole mobility. It may also be related to the molecular weight. When the molecular weight is not very high , the lm - forming property and phase separation of the polymers / PC61BM can be improved by increasing the molecular weight , then lead to a higher FF and J sc value , 36,37 and the PCE was improved . In summary , two new benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene and thiazole ( Tz ) copolymers with DTBT and DTffBT side chains were successfully synthesized and characterized. Both of the copolymers exhibited good thermal stability. The research results showed that the conjugated side chains could broaden the absorption spectra as well as improve the hole - transporting properties , and in turn improve the power conversion efficiencies. Two copolymers appeared promising for the application in BHJ solar cells due to their good solubilities , low band gaps as well as their high hole mobilities. The broad absorption spectrum , deep HOMO energy level and the noticeably high hole mobility of PT-Tz-DTffBT contributed to the outstanding J sc and V oc values as well as the high PCE of 3.75% . The PCE of the inverted device based on PT-Tz-DTffBT reached to 4.42% , which showed that PT-Tz-DTffBT was promising for potential applications in photovoltaic cells. These results indicated that the chemical modication thus provided a simple and effective way for tuning the optoelectronic properties of the conjugated polymers .",

The polymers were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , absorption spectroscopy , cyclic voltammetry , in situ spectroelectrochemical and photovoltaic measurements , and compared with poly(3-hexyl-thienylene vinylene ) ( P3HTV ). The absorption peaks of the conjugated side chains and main chains of the biTV - PTVs both red - shifted in comparison with those of the monomer and P3HTV , indicating that the conjugation degree of both the side chains and the main chains is extended in the biTV - PTVs. In particular , the biTV - PTV3 film shows a strong and broad absorption band covering the whole visible region from 380 to 780 nm. Cyclic voltammograms of the polymers revealed that the LUMO of the biTV - PTVs decreased and their HOMO increased a little so that the E g values of the biTV - PTVs were reduced in comparison with P3HTV. In situ absorption spectra of biTV - PTV3 at different potentials indicate that the oxidation of the polymer is accompanied by the p - doping of the conjugated main chains and the polymer can be used as an electrochromic material. Photovoltaic properties of biTV - PTV3 were investigated with the polymer solar cell ( PSC ) based on the blend of the polymer and PCBM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2. The power conversion efficiency of the PSC reached 0.32% , which is 52% increased in comparison with that of the device based on P3HTV under the same experimental conditions . Conjugated polymers have drawn much attention since the discovery of conducting polyacethylene in 1977^1 due to the basic research interests on their curious structure - property relationship and their promising applications in many fields. 2 The important properties of the conjugated polymers include conductivity of their doped state for the applications as conducting polymers , 1,3 absorption spectra for applications in polymer solar cells 4 and electrochromic displays , 5 electrochemical properties for applications as electrode materials 6 and for estimating the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers , 7 and photoluminescent properties for applications in polymer light - emitting devices. 8 Therefore , design and synthesis of new conjugated polymers possessing special properties should be of crucial importance for the development of the studies on the conjugated polymers. In recent years , side chain conjugated polymers attracted attention for the modulation of the electronic structures of the conjugated polymers. Bunz et al. synthesized the side - chain conjugated poly(p-phenyleneethynylene)s with phenylenevinylene side chains for the band gap engineering of the conjugated polymers.",

    "sentence": "9 Recently , the authors designed and synthesized a series of side - chain conjugated polythiophenes ( PTs ) aimed at broad absorption conjugated polymers for the application in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). 10,11 The side chain conjugated PTs show two absorption peaks in their UV - vis absorption spectra , a UV peak corresponding to the absorption of the conjugated side chains and a visible peak attributed to the π-π* transition of the PT main chains. 10,11a By using bi-(thienylene vinylene ) as the conjugated side chains , the UV peak was red - shifted to visible region. The conjugated polymers of the biTV - PTs show broad and strong absorption from 380 to 650 nm and high power conversion efficiency of the PSCs based on the biTV - PTs was obtained. 11b In this paper , we synthesized the bi(thienylene vinylene ) substituted poly(thienylene vinylene)s ( biTV - PTVs ) , for further extending the absorption of the conjugated polymers to a longer wavelength region , in considering that PTVs possess narrower band gap and broader absorption band than PTs. 12 The biTV - PTVs could also be called as branched poly(thienylene vinylene)s because the composition of the conjugated side chains is the same with the main chains. Scheme 1 shows the molecular structures of the biTV - PTVs together with that of P3HTV for comparison. The biTV - PTVs show very broad absorption band covering the whole visible region from 380 to 780 nm. The in situ spectroelectrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the biTV - PTVs were also investigated . The polymers of biTV - PTVs were synthesized by Stille coupling of 2,5dibromo-3-bi(thienylene vinylene)thiophene monomers with (E)-1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethane. 13 The synthesis routes of (E)-1,2bis(tributylstannyl)ethane and the polymers are shown in Schemes 2 and 3 , respectively. The vinyl bonds on the 3-position of monomer biTVT in Scheme 3 were formed by Horner - Emmons reaction. The 1H NMR spectrum of biTVT shows very neat peaks for the protons of the trans-vinyl bond , indicating that the vinyl bonds are all in trans structure. 11b The values of m : n of the biTV-PTV1-3 were estimated roughly by 1H NMR. As shown in Figure 1 , the hydrogen on position a shows a peak at δ2.69 ppm , and the hydrogen on position b shows a peak at δ2.74 ppm. Hence , the values of m : n could be calculated from the ratio of the integral areas of the two peaks. The m : n values obtained are not accurate due to the overlap of the two peaks. Since the three polymers have similar structure , we only put the 1H NMR spectrum of biTV - PTV2 in Figure 1. 2.2. Thermal Analysis. Thermal stability of the three polymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure 2. The three biTV - PTVs show similar onset decomposition temperatures as P3HTV at about 280 °C , which indicates that the conjugated side chains had little effect on the thermal stability of the PTVs.",

    "sentence": "The onset decomposition temperature of the biTV - PTVs is a little lower than that ( ca. 300 °C ) of the bi(thienylene vinylene ) substituted polythiophenes ( biTV - PTs ) , 11b but the thermal stability is enough for most applications. Differential scan calorimetric ( DSC ) analysis of the biTV - PTVs showed no detectable T g or T m in the range from 30 to 250 ° C. 2.3. Absorption Spectra. Figure 3 shows the absorption spectra of the biTV - PTVs , and the absorption spectra of biTVT and P3HTV were also put in the figure for comparison. Similar to the side chain conjugated polythiophenes ( PTs ) , 10,11 the absorption spectra of the biTV - PTVs also show two absorption peaks. One at the shorter wavelength region is attributed to the conjugated side chains , another at the longer wavelength region is attributed to the conjugated main chains. 10,11 From the solution absorption spectra in Figure 3a , it can be seen that the absorption peaks of the bi(thienylenevinylene) side chains in biTV-PTV1-3 red - shifted to about 440 nm in comparison with that of the monomer biTVT. While for the thienylenevinylene substituted PTs , the short wavelength absorption peak position is entirely the same as that of its monomer. 11 Probably , the same thienylenevinylene composition of the side - chain and main - chain in the biTV - PTVs benefited the mutual interaction and extended the conjugation degree of the side chains. For the main chain absorption peaks of the biTV - PTVs , the solution absorption peaks are almost the same with that of P3HTV , while the absorption peaks of the biTV - PTVs films are obviously redshifted in comparison with that of P3HTV film although the absorption of P3HTV film is also slightly red - shifted than its solution , and the absorption edge of biTV - PTV3 is red - shifted to 780 nm. Most importantly , biTV - PTV3 film shows a very broad plateau absorption peak with strong absorbance , covering the whole visible region from 380 to 780 nm. In comparison with that of biTV - PTs , 11b the absorption spectra of the biTV - PTVs broadened by more than 100 nm in the long wavelength region , which benefited from their PTV main chains. Table 1 listed the peak absorbance and full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the absorption spectra of the polymers. For the polymer of biTV - PTV3 , the fwhm is much broader than P3HTV , with the absorbance at the peak position of 605 nm close to that of P3HTV at the peak wavelength of 585 nm. To investigate the light harvest ability of the polymer films for the application in polymer solar cells , we calculated the integral areas of the absorbance of a 1 nm thick film of the polymers in the visible region , and the results were also listed in Table 1.",

    "sentence": "The integral area of biTV - PTV3 is 34% more than that of P3HTV , which indicates that biTV - PTV3 possesses a better light harvest ability than P3HTV. It should be mentioned here that no photoluminescent ( PL ) emission was observed in the measurement of the PL spectrum of the biTV - PTVs , which agrees with the nonluminescent characteristic of the poly(thienylene vinylene)s due to the fact that its lowest energy excited state ( 2A g ) to the ground state ( 1A g ) is forbidden. 14 2.4. Electrochemical Properties. The electrochemical properties of various conjugated polymers have attracted great attention 6,7,15 since the discovery of conducting polymers , because it is one of the most important properties of the conjugated polymers and many applications of the conjugated polymers are depending on the electrochemical properties. Here we studied the electrochemical properties of the biTV - PTVs by cyclic voltammetry and in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements. Figure 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms ( CVs ) of the biTV - PTV3 and P3HTV. Since the three polymers of biTV-PTV1-3 showed similar CV curves , we only put the CV of biTV - PTV3 in Figure 3. It can be seen that the biTV - PTVs exhibit reversible p - doping / dedoping ( oxidation / rereduction ) processes at positive potential range and n - doping / dedoping ( reduction / reoxidation ) processes at negative potential range. From the onset oxidation potentials ( ox ) and the onset reduction potentials ( red ) of the polymers , HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the energy gap ( E g ec ) of the polymers were calculated according to the equations : 16 where the units of ox and red are V vs Ag / Ag + . The values obtained are listed in Table 2. In comparison with P3HTV , red of biTV - PTV3 shifted positively by 0.09 V , while ox of biTV - PTV3 shifted negatively by ca. 0.03 V , and the electrochemical energy gap of biTV - PTV3 is narrower than that of P3HTV by 0.12 eV. Obviously , the conjugated side chain lowered the LUMO and raised the HOMO of the PTVs. The results of the electrochemical measurements agree with the absorption spectra mentioned above. It is interesting to compare the effect of the bi(thienylene vinylene ) ( biTV ) side chains on the onset oxidation potentials of the biTV - PTVs with that of the biTV - PTs , it is a little negatively shifted for the biTV - PTVs as mentioned above , but it is positively shifted by ca. 0.2 V for the biTV - PTs. 11b Probably , the branched structure in biTV - PTVs ( the same composition of the conjugated side chains and the main chains in the polymers ) plays an important role for the negative shift of the biTV - PTVs.",

    "sentence": "To investigate the electrochemical oxidation mechanism of the biTV - PTVs , in situ absorption spectra of biTV - PTV3 were measured at the potentials of 0.2 , 0.4 , and 0.6 V vs Ag / Ag + , as shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that with the increase of the potential from 0.2 to 0.6 V , the absorption peak at 605 nm decreases and the absorption in the near - infrared region increases. The appearance of the near - infrared absorption peak and the decrease of the main chain absorption are the charac - teristics of the doped structure of the conducting polymers such as polypyrrole , 15b polyaniline , 15a and poly(3-alkylthoiphene ). 17 Therefore , the result in Figure 5 indicates that the main chain of biTV - PTV3 was oxidized and doped in the potential range corresponding to the oxidation peak in Figure 4. In addition , a color change of the polymer film from black to yellow was observed after the oxidation , which indicates that the polymer could be used as an electrochromic material. 2.5. Photovoltaic Properties of biTV)PTV3. Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted much interest in recent years , 4,11,[18][19][20][21] because of their advantages of low cost , light weight , and easy fabrication. For the conjugated polymers used in the PSCs , strong and broad absorptions in visible region as well as high charge carrier mobility are most important for fabricating highly efficient PSCs. As mentioned above , the branched poly-(thienylene vinylene ) biTV - PTV3 possesses a strong and broad absorption band in visible region ; hence , we used it as electron donor material to fabricate bulk heterojunction PSC 4 with the structure of ITO / PEDOT - PSS(30 nm ) / biTV - PTV3 : PCBM(1 : 1 , w / w , 70 nm ) / Mg(10 nm ) / Al(150 nm ) where PCBM ( 1-(3methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl-[6,6]-C-61 ) was used as the electron acceptor. To make clear comparisons with P3HTV , the device based on P3HTV was also fabricated with the same device structure. Figure 6 shows the I-V curves of the PSCs based on biTV - PTV3 and P3HTV under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2 , and Table 3 lists the photovoltaic properties obtained from the I-V curves. It can be seen from Table 3 that the open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the PSC based on biTV - PTV3 was 0.03 V lower than that of the PSC based on P3HTV , which agrees with the 0.03 eV higher of the HOMO level of biTV - PTV3 ( see Table 2 ) , since the V oc of PSCs is related to the difference of the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor.",

As listed in Table 3 , the short circuit current ( I sc ) of the device based on biTV - PTV3 was 2.27 mA / cm^2 , while that of the device based on P3HTV was only 1.24 mA / cm^2 , which should be the main reason for the increase of the PCE. Although , the weight ratio of donor to acceptor of 1 : 1 was not the optimal ratio for P3HTV , the PCE ( 0.21% ) of the device based on P3HTV by this ratio was close to the best results of the PTVs based devices reported by Smith et al. with a value of 0.24% 24 and by us with a value of 0.26% . 22 However , the PCE value of the device based on biTV - PTV3 is much lower than that based on the bi(thienylene vinylene ) substituted polythiophenes , 11b which is probably related to the nonluminescent property of the poly(thienylene vinylene)s. 14 The input photon to converted current efficiency ( IPCE ) curves of the devices based on biTV - PTV3 and P3HTV are shown in Figure 7. The IPCE of the device based on P3HTV exhibited a similar to that from the PSC device based on poly-(3-dodecylthienylene vinylene ). 24 The device based on biTV - PTV3 exhibited a rather broader IPCE curve than that of P3HTV. biTV - PTV3 showed high IPCE values ( external quantum efficiency ) of 4.5 - 5.1% in a wide wavelength range from 420 to 660 nm , which is coincident with the broad absorption band of biTV - PTV3 mentioned above. Obviously , the higher I sc value of the device based on biTV - PTV3 was benefited from the broader absorption band of the branched PTV , and it also provided a solid proof that the conjugated side chain enhanced the light harvest ability of the PTVs . Three bi(thienylene vinylene ) - substituted poly(thienylene vinylene)s ( biTV - PTVs ) , were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction. The absorption peaks of the conjugated side chains of the branched biTV - PTVs red - shifted in comparison with that of the monomer biTVT , indicating that the conjugation degree of the side chains is extended in the biTV - PTVs.",

Especially , new device architectures have been developed to promote the performance of devices such as inverted , 5 ternary blended 6 and tandem structures. 7 The power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) of PSCs have been pushed from 8% to over 10% within recent three years. [8][9][10][11] However , the design of ideal polymer donors remains a challenge to achieve both high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , and fill factors ( FF ). 1 They must possess at least the following characteristics such as good solubility , broad absorption band , and appropriate energy levels of highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) , since these properties are closely related to the above-mentioned key parameters of BHJ solar cells. 12 Recently , benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene ( BDT ) has been widely explored as a donor unit in the design of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) polymers for BHJ cells due to its lower HOMO energy level and broader UV - Vis absorption properties.

The bis(dialkylthienyl) benzodithiophene based polymer PBDTT - FID exhibited a PCE of 7.04% in BHJ cells. 21 Among the large number of A units explored , dithienyl-55 benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) has attracted great attention for its property of energy levels for D-A polymers. 22,23 Especially , the introduction of fluorine atom onto dithienyl-benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) could increase the PCE of DTBT - based polymer solar cells. 24 The improvement was attributed to an optimal 60 morphology of the active layer likely due to fluorine substitution. 25 The impact of fluorination on BT was further elaborated by associating a BDT motif as weak donor and 5,6difluorinated or non-fluorinated BT groups. The introduced fluorine as side chains was found to greatly affect the morphology , processability and device efficiency due to intermolecular interactions , even though the polymers shared similar bandgaps.",

    "sentence": "26 In light of the ever - increasing interest in developing 2-dimensional ( 2D ) aromatic fused ring structure to fine tune the energy levels and facilitate regular π-π stacking of 70 polymer backbones , the impact of mono-fluorinated BT ring on optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of the resultant polymers was further examined with polymers with nonsubstituted or conjugated side chain substituted BT as accepting motif . In this work , we have herein designed and synthesized two new polymers by alternating mono-fluorinated benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( fBT ) or dodecylthienyl subsitituted BT ( fTBT ) as acceptor unit with bis(4,5-bis(octylthio)thienyl substituted BDT ( BDTTs ) as donor unit. The BDTTs motif was 80 chosen as a weak donor unit because bis(octylthio) possesses strong electron - donating capacity and thienyl substitution helps to improve hole mobility , lower the HOMO level and broaden the absorption band. 27 The thermal , optical and electrochemical properties of the resulted polymer were systematically studied . The best BHJ device fabricated from PBDTTs - fBT and PC71BM as the active layer showed a maximum PCE of 6.27% , with a J sc of 11.7 mA cm^-2 , a V oc of 0.89 V and a FF of 60.5% . As shown in Scheme 1 , bis(4,5-bis(octylthio)thienyl substituted BDT M1 was synthesized with a two - step protocol. The lithiation - promoted coupling between 4,8-dihydrobenzo [ With 2-D structured BDT donating monomer M1 and BT accepting monomer M2 at hand , the alternating polymer PBDTTs - fTBT ( Scheme 2 ) was readily prepared using 20 palladium - catalyzed Stille coupling at high yield ( ca 82% ). The reference polymer PBDTTs - fBT with non-conjugated side chain substituted BT accepting motif was also prepared in 78% yield with mono-fluorinated DTBT M3. 24b The detail synthesis of both 5-bromo-6-fluoro-4,7-diiodobenzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole 8 and M3 25 was described in Electronic Supplemental Information ( ESI ). The as-prepared polymers exhibited good solubility in 30 chloroform , dichlorobenzene and toluene. The number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of PBDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT were determined to be 12.5 kDa and 20.6 kDa respectively ( Table 1 ). The corresponding polydispersity index ( PDI ) was 3.80 and 4.25. PBDTTs - fTBT presented the highest M n due to 35 the existence of solubilising alkylthienyl side chains. The thermal property of two polymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ). As shown by the TGA traces in Fig. S1 , good thermal stability was observed for both polymers , indicated by the high Td(temperature corresponding to 5% 40 weight loss ) of 357 and 372 °C for PBDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT , respectively. The good thermal stability endows the polymers great potential for their application in optoelectronic devices. 28 The UV - vis absorption spectra of the polymers in both 45 chloroform solutions ( ~ 10^-5 M ) and solid films are shown in Figure 1a , with the wavelengths of absorption maximum ( λ max ) summarized in Table 1.",

    "sentence": "Clearly , the polymers display similar features of absorption bands in solution and solid film in Figure 2. Polymers PBDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT solutions in 50 chloroform exhibit quite similar absorption profiles , where strong absorption band in the range of 300 ~ 650 nm is observed with λ max peaking at 585 and 577 nm , respectively. In contrast , PBDTTs - fTBT exhibit 8 nm blue - shifted absorption band in comparison to PBDTTs - fBT , due to the introduction of 55 alkylthienyl into fBT. The polymer films present wide absorption bands in the range of 300 ~ 650 nm with a λ max peaking at 598 for PBDTTs - fBT and 597 nm for PBDTTs - fTBT , respectively. BDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT thus exhibited 13 and 20 nm red - shifted absorption band when transferred from their solution 60 to films , indicating the occurring of more strengthened conjugation in solid state. A close look at the optical results of PBDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT , one would find that the introduction of an alklythienyl substituent to BT core leads to a ~ 10 nm blue - shifted absorption spectra , mainly due to the expanded conjugated system and the electron - donating effect of thienyl group. In comparison to PBDTTs - fBT , PBDTTs - fTBT shows more red - shifted absorption when transferred from solution to film , suggesting the enhanced steric hindrance over 2D conjugated BT moiety when substituted with aromatic 70 functionality. The wavelength of absorption onset ( λ onset ) of polymer film was determined as 788 and 730 nm for PBDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - fTBT , respectively. The optical bandgaps ( E g opt ) 28 can be estimated to be 1.57 and 1.69 eV for PBDTTs - fBT and 75 PBDTTs - fTBT ( Table 1 ) , respectively. The two polymers possess favorable absorption spectra and E g opt , adumbrating the ordered polymer chains and densely packed side chains in solid state , which should be helpful to get higher photovoltaic results. 29^80 Electrochemical properties of the as-prepared BDT polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( Fig. 1b ). Two polymers underwent an irreversible oxidation , similar to other BDT based D-A polymers. 19 The onset potential for oxidation ( E onset ox ) was observed to be 1.11 and 1.08 V for PBDTTs - fBT 85 and PBDTTs - fTBT , respectively. With E onset ox at hand , the HOMO levels of two polymers could thus be calculated ( Table 1 ). The LUMO levels of two polymers were further calculated to be -3.94 eV for PBDTTs - fBT and -3.79 eV for PBDTTs - fTBT by using the equation of LUMO = HOMO + E g opt ( eV ). 28 The result indicated the deep HOMO levels ( ≤ -5.0 eV ) of these 2D conjugated bis(alkylthio) BDTT polymers would be beneficial for obtaining high V oc in BHJ solar cells.",

Compared with fTBT and DTBT , 30 fBT 15 maintained rather lower energy levels and wider absorption region , due to the electron - accepting nature and low steric hindrance of single fluorine group. = -e(Eonset ox + 4.4 ) ( eV ) , e LUMO = HOMO + Eg opt . 28 To further reveal the differences between two polymers in electronic structures and HOMO / LUMO levels , the theoretical models of two polymers were simulated. To simplify the 25 calculation , the long alkyl or alkylthio were subituted by methyl or methylthio , respectively. Two repeat units of polymers were selected to instead of whole D-A polymer backbone. The optimal geometries and electronic structures of the polymers were simulated by density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations at the 30 B3LYP / 6-31G(d,p) level using the Gaussian 09 program suite. 31 As shown in Fig. 2 , the HOMOs of all polymers are extensively delocalized , with the electron density of LUMO is mainly localized on the electron - accepting fBT or fTBT units. The energy levels of HOMO / LUMO were calculated to be -35^4.97 / -3.06 and -4.93 / -2.96 eV for PBDTTs - fBT and PBDTTs - FTBT , resepectively. The corresponding bandgap was thus calculated to be 1.91 eV and 1.87 eV for two polymers. Although the calculated results have some differences with those obtained from CV , the trend of HOMOs and bandgap is consistent with 40 the experimental measurement , i.e. , higher energy levels and larger bandgap were observed for PBDTTs - fTBT due to the existance of bulky donating side - chain. The photovoltaic potential of our as-prepared polymers were explored using the conventional single - layer device with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 40 nm ) / polymer : PC71BM / LiF ( 5 nm ) / Al ( or Ag ) ( Table 2 and Fig. 3 ). Blend films of 50 polymer : PC71BM spin - coated from the different solutions with 3% DIO were acted as the photoactive layers. 32 The effect of THF annealing on the photovoltaic performance of polymer / PC71BM ( 1 : 2 ) solar cells was first investigated with blend films spincoated from chloroform ( CF ) solutions with the addition of 3% 55 DIO. As summarized in Table 2 , PBDTTs - fBT / PC71BM ( 1 : 2 ) device showed the best device performance with active layer annealed by THF vapour for 30 s. A PCE of 4.02% was obtained , with a V oc of 0.90 V , a J sc of 8.62 mA cm^-2 and a FF of 51.9% .",

PBDTTs - fTBT / PC71BM ( 1 : 2 ) devices , however , only showed a highest PCE of 1.29% with 60 s THF annealing. However , PBDTTs-fTBT:PC71BM based solar cells exhibited higher V oc ( 0.94 V ) but lower J sc than PBDTTs - fBT based ones. The inverse dependence of device V oc with 65 donor polymer 's HOMO level is consistent with Thompson 's findings. 33 In this case , the less ordered , more amorphous donor materials with structures that hindered the intermolecular π-π* interactions produced lower J sc and therefore higher V oc values. The increased hindrance with the introduction of alkylthienyl the active layer on the performance of devices was also studied by increasing the rotation speed of spin - coater. When comparing with the photovoltaic performance of active layer spin - coated at 2000 rpm ( 5.12% PCE ) with that at 1000 rpm ( 4.91% PCE ) , one can find that thicker blend films could significantly improve the 5 FF of solar cells , hence the photovoltaic properties of devices. To improve the performance of PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 ) 30 devices , Ag cathode with a lower work function ( WF , -4.7 eV ) was used to replaced Al ( WF : -4.3 eV ). 34 The devices with configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 40 nm ) / PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM ( 1 : 1 ) / PFN ( 5 nm ) / Ag were fabricated and processed from o-DCB solution with the addition of 3% DIO .

    "sentence": "The power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) solar cells based on polymer - fullerene blends are approaching the benchmark value of 10% for single - junction cells , [1][2][3][4] largely ascribable to the rapid advancement of novel donor polymers. [5][6][7][8][9] Among different strategies to molecularly engineer conjugated polymers for BHJ solar cells , the alternating \" donor - acceptor \" ( D-A ) concept has prevailed because it offers a high level of flexibility in tuning absorption spectra and frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the resulting D-A copolymers. For example , it becomes increasingly evident that the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest occupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of a D-A alternating copolymer can be approximated by the HOMO level of the \" donor \" ( D ) structural unit and the LUMO level of the \" acceptor \" ( A ) unit , respectively. 8 This important feature has enabled the design of polymers with a low HOMO level in conjunction with a low band gap , in order to simultaneously achieve a high open circuit voltage ( V oc ) and a high short circuit current ( J sc ). 10 While the structures of the aromatic units in these D-A copolymers have largely decided the photovoltaic performance of the BHJ solar cells , 11 other structural parameters can also have strong influence , for example , these peripheral side chains , [12][13][14] and functional substituents ( e.g. , fluorine ). [15][16][17] Thus , to further advance the PCE values , one popular approach is to molecularly engineer and finetune the structure of top performing D-A copolymers ; 9,18,19 however , such a strategy can only lead to incremental increases on the PCE , if successfully demonstrated. On the other hand , a 45 more challenging yet more rewarding strategy is the creative design and synthesis of novel structural units and related polymers. Such a strategy has been playing a crucial role in maintaining the upward trend of the device efficiency towards the predicted PCE of 15% for polymer BHJ solar cells. 20-24 50 The structural units , either \" donor \" ( D ) or \" acceptor \" ( A ) in these D-A alternating copolymers , are often based on fused aromatics , typically via annulation of different small aromatic units ( e.g. , benzene , thiophene , pyrrole , pyridine , etc. ). One such example is the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene ( BDT ) , an benzannulated 55 compound with two fused thiophenes. BDT and its derivatives have been found in many conjugated polymers with high photovoltaic performance in corresponding BHJ solar cells , with efficiency values already approaching 10% . 1,9,15,16,25 Interestingly , one of BDT 's structural isomers , benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophene 60 ( BDP ) with an angular - shape ( rather than the linear - shaped BDT ) , received much less attention since we first introduced it into conjugated polymers for BHJ solar cells.",

    "sentence": "26 In fact , there are a number of benefits associated with these angular - shaped units to construct conjugated polymers for optoelectronic applications. compared with these linear - shaped BDT - based polymers. 28 Furthermore , others have identified that these fused aromatic moieties of angular shapes ( e.g. , BDP ) can further modulate the frontier molecular orbital energy levels , leading to lower - lying HOMO level and higher - lying LUMO energy level than their 5 linear - shaped counterparts ( e.g. , BDT ). 29,30 This HOMO-lowering effect suggests that angular - shaped \" donor \" would be very useful in building D-A alternating copolymers to attain higher V oc in corresponding BHJ solar cells , and possibly higher J sc and fill factor ( FF ) due to better charge transport ( i.e. , high mobility ) . Unfortunately , the BHJ solar cells of BDP based D-A copolymers were found to be much less efficient , [31][32][33] with the highest efficiency ever reported being only 4.45% , 31 achieved by BHJ devices based on the PDPP - BDP , a D-A copolymer combining BDP as the \" donor \" structural unit , with the \" acceptor \" unit of 3,6-dithiophen-2-yl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ). It appears that one major issue is the larger optical band gaps usually observed with BDP based conjugated polymers , which would lead to a smaller J sc in BHJ solar cell devices. This large band gap can be ascribed to the shorter conjugation length 20 by these angular - shaped fused polycyclic aromatics than that by their linear counterparts. One plausible solution to mitigate the large band gaps of these BDP based conjugated polymers while ( hopefully ) maintaining the aforementioned benefits of having BDP is to substitute the 25 sulfur in these thiophene units with selenium. Indeed , as the thiophene analog , selenophene can help lower the LUMO energy level of its conjugated polymer with an almost unchanged HOMO level when compared with those energy levels from the thiophene based counterparts. 34,35 Furthermore , the more 30 polarizable selenium ( Se ) allows stronger Se-Se intermolecular interactions , which can lead to better π electron overlap between adjacent conjugated backbones and improve the charge transport property. [36][37][38] These interesting features associated with selenophene prompted us to explore the incorporation of 35 selenophene units into the angular - shaped BDP. Figure 1 shows the normalized UV - vis absorption spectra of PBDSe - DTBT in solution and as thin film spin - coated on pre- cleaned glass substrate. In o-DCB solution at room temperature , PBDSe - DTBT shows two main absorption bands commonly observed in D-A conjugated polymers , with a high energy band peak at 393 nm , and a maximum absorption peak at 544 nm corresponding to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) interactions.",

    "sentence": "These absorption features remains relatively unchanged at an elevated temperature of 80 °C , indicating there is no significant aggregation of PBDSe - DTBT in dilute solution ( 10^-3 mg mL -1 ). However , in the solid state as thin films , both two main absorption peaks red - shifted remarkably by 30 nm and 51 nm , locating at 423 nm and 595 nm , respectively , and became broader when compared to those in solution. In addition , a new identifiable shoulder peak near 650 nm emerges , which is believed to represent the degree of the interchain stacking as reported for other polymers. 42,43 The large red - shifts and presence of the shoulder peak indicate enhanced intermolecular interactions and strong aggregation among the individual polymer chains in thin films. This broad absorption and well - ordered packing of polymer chains would benefit the J sc and the charge carrier ( i.e. , hole ) mobility. Finally , a relatively small optical band gap of 1.71 eV was estimated for PBDSe - DTBT , calculated from the onset of the film absorption. To estimate the frontier orbital energy levels , cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements were performed on the PBDSe - DTBT thin film drop - cast on a glass carbon disk , using a standard threeelectrode configuration. As shown in Figure 2a , quasi reversible oxidation and irreversible reduction processes were detected. The first oxidation potential and reduction potential onset are located at 0.57 V and -1.30 V , respectively , which were calibrated with the redox potentials of the Fc / Fc + couple. According to the empirical formula of HOMO = -(E ox , onset + 4.8 ) eV and LUMO = -(E red , onset + 4.8 ) eV , the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDSe - DTBT were estimated to be -5.37 eV and -3.50 eV ( see Table 1 ) , respectively. Since the V oc of polymer solar cells is largely dependent on the interface gap between the HOMO level of the donor material and the LUMO level of the acceptor 40 material , 44,45 the relative deep HOMO energy level of PBDSe - DTBT could result in a high V oc . On the other hand , the energy offsets of ~ 0.7 eV ( Figure 2b ) , between the HOMO levels of PBDSe - DTBT and PC71BM and between the corresponding LUMO levels , could enable efficient exciton separation and 45 charge transfer at the donor - acceptor ( e.g. , polymer - fullerene ) interface. In summary , the optical and electrochemical properties of PBDSe - DTBT support our design rationale of adopting the unique advantages of angular - shaped \" donor \" moiety and Se heteroatom to obtain both a low optical band gap and a low - lying 50 HOMO level in D-A copolymers , with the ultimate goal to achieve both an increased J sc and a high V oc in BHJ solar cells.",

For each studied weight ratio , we also varied the film thickness of the BHJ blend as part of the device optimization procedure. All the device data are summarized in Table S2 , through which we identified the optimal weight ratio was 1 : 1 to achieve the maximal efficiency. The current - voltage ( J-V ) curves and photovoltaic properties of BHJ devices with the maximal efficiency at each processing condition are displayed in Figure 3a and Table 2 , respectively. As expected , relatively high V oc of ~ 0.8 V was observed in all PBDSe - DTBT : PC71BM based BHJ solar cells , consistent with the low - lying HOMO energy level of PBDSe - DTBT. Combined with a higher average J sc of 8.9 mA cm^-2 , the BHJ device with PBDSe - DTBT : PC71BM at a 1 : 1 weight ratio gave the highest 15 PCE of 2.7% among all the blending ratios studied ( without additives ) , primarily due to a low FF of 0.37. However , with the addition of 1% 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) as the processing additive in the polymer : fullerene solution , 46 the PCE was dramatically improved up to 5.6% , with a significant increase on both J sc 20 ( 12.30 mA cm^-2 ) and FF ( 0.57 ) ( Figure 3a ). To the best of our knowledge , this is the highest PCE value among all reported BHJ solar cells based on conjugated polymers containing angularshaped benzodithiophene derivatives. [31][32][33]47 To shed more light on the observed increase of J sc when the processing additive was added , we compared the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of the optimized devices processed with and without the additive , as shown in Figure 3b. The device processed from 1% DIO additive exhibits a slightly broader EQE response ( i.e. , from 350 nm to over 700 nm ) than that of the device from the additive - free processing. However , the EQE value of the device processed with the additive is noticeably higher across the entire photoresponse range , with the maximum EQE reaching 60% . The much improved EQE is directly related with the increased absorption of the blend film processed with the additive ( see Supplementary Information Figure S3 ) , and also likely benefits from a better charge carrier extraction due to improved mobility and morphology by applying the processing additive ( vide infra ) . It is generally agreed that a desirable morphology of BHJ films would include polymer - rich and fullerene - rich domains of 10-20 nm in domain sizes , connected through the polymer / fullerene 50 intermixed domains. 48 Furthermore , both crystalline regions and amorphous regions are important.",

    "sentence": "All these morphological characteristics contribute to achieving high J sc and FF. 4,49 For example , too large a domain of high purity would negatively impact the exciton dissociation , while too small a domain with 55 excellent mixing of polymer and fullerene would impede the charge transport. 50 To probe the morphological features of these BHJ blended processed under different conditions , we first applied atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to investigate the top surface morphology of the blend films ( Figure 4 ). The obtained 60 height images show that the BHJ blend film processed with 1% DIO has a larger root-mean-square roughness ( RMS ) of 9.6 nm ( Figure 4a ) , compared with a RMS of 0.4 nm ( Figure 4c film processed without any additives. The relative coarse surface morphology in the DIO-processed film , indicated by its larger RMS value , could be attributed to the self - organized ordering or the crystalline domain of the polymer ( PBDSe - DTBT ) in the BHJ blend , as frequently reported for other DIO processed polymer : fullerene films. 49,51 This relatively ordered structure can improve the charge carrier mobility , which would facilitate the carrier transport and attenuate the charge recombination , thereby enhancing the J sc and FF. On the other hand , the phase images ( Figure 4b ) offer some insights on the phase separation. Compared with the featureless phase image of the BHJ film without any additives , the DIO processed blend film shows more favorable phase separation with rather uniform and moderate domain sizes of ~ 20-30 nm. This close to \" ideal \" domain size would benefit the exciton dissociation and lead to a higher J sc . To probe the structural order / molecular packing in these BHJ 20 films , we applied grazing incident X-ray diffraction ( GIXRD ) to investigate thin films of both the pristine polymer and its BHJ blends ( Figure 5 ). The pristine PBDSe - DTBT thin film displays a distinguishable [100] diffraction peak at 5.30 ° with a corresponding d spacing of 16.67 Å , representing the inter-chain distance determined by these alkyl side chains. Another weak peak at 22.25 ° can be assigned to the π-π stacking between the polymer backbones. After PBDSe - DTBT was blended with PC71BM , the film processed without additives also displays a [100] peak at 5.32 ° , indicating relatively crystalline nature of polymers in this BHJ film. Interestingly , adding 1% DIO additive during the film processing induces a considerable decrease of this inter-chain spacing from 16.67 Å to 14.72 Å ( given the diffraction peak shifting from 5.30 ° to 6.0 ° ) , suggesting that the polymer chains are better packed along the inter-chain direction in the DIO-processed BHJ film. This increased structure order is also supported by the UV - vis absorption of the DIO-processed BHJ film(see supplementary Figure S3 ) , with a new pronounced absorption shoulder peak at ~ 659 nm.",

This improved molecular packing is generally believed to benefit charge carrier mobilities and J sc , consistent with our observations of higher J sc and FF of the 1% DIO-processed BHJ solar cell than the device processed with 45 solvent only . 50 As a direct result from the improved molecular packing in the 1% DIO-processed BHJ solar cell than the device processed without additives , the hole mobility of the former device , determined by the space charge limited ( SCLC ) current method , is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of the latter , 2.0 × 10^-4 cm^2 55 V -1 S^-1 vs. 2.4 × 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ( see supplementary Figure S5 ). Electron mobilities , on the other hand , are quite comparable , with 5.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 for the 1% DIO-processed cell and 1.9 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 for the one processed without additives. This is not surprisingly , given the electron mobility is mainly determined by 60 the n - type PC71BM in these BHJ films. Taking all these mobility data together , the DIO processed device shows a much balanced mobility ratio ( µ e / µ h = 2.55 ) when compared with that of the device processed without additives ( µ e / µ h = 79 ). This significantly un-balanced electron / hole mobility in the latter case would lead 65 to an accumulation of holes - which has a dramatically low mobility than that of the electron in this case-in the device. The excess of holes would weaken the build-in potential that drives the extraction of charge carriers , leading to a reduced FF and J sc . 53 Therefore , the higher and more balanced carrier mobilities 70 in the DIO processed device may avoid space charge accumulation and reduce recombination losses ( vide infra ) , 52,54,55 which explains the higher FF of 0.57 and J sc of 12.30 mA cm^-2 in the DIO processed device. Finally , we investigated the recombination losses of charge 75 carriers via probing the relationship between the device J-V characteristics and the incident light intensity. Specifically , we plotted V oc versus the logarithm of light intensity to find n , following V oc ∝ nkT / qln(P) ( Figure 6a ) , 56,57 where k is Boltzmann constant , T is the temperature in Kelvin , q is the 80 elementary charge , and P is the light intensity. A close to unity for the value of n would indicate that the bimolecular ( Langevin ) Polymer Chemistry Accepted Manuscript recombination dominates the recombination loss. 55,58 When additional Shockley-Read-Hall ( SRH ) or trap - assisted recombination is involved , the competition with the bimolecular recombination would lead to a much increased n.",

    "sentence": "59 Fitting the curves in Figure 6a yields a value of 1.15 for the n in the DIO processed device and 1.51 for the device processed without any additives. This result implies a reduced trap - assisted recombination in the DIO processed device , which can be associate with the improved molecular packing in this BHJ film , as discussed earlier. On the other hand , the dependence of J sc on light intensity can be plotted according to their relationship : J sc ∝ ( P light ) α ( Figure 6b ) , 55,58 where the value of the power law scaling exponent α indicates the strength of the bimolecular recombination. The closer the α approaches unity , the less bimolecular recombination. Indeed , a larger α ( 0.95 ) was 15 obtained for the DIO processed device than that of the device processed without additives ( 0.91 ) , indicating less bimolecular recombination loss in the DIO processed device. The reduced bimolecular recombination would lead to more charge carriers surviving the transport process and finally being extracted , 58 , 60^20 contributing to the higher J sc achieved in the DIO processed device , and the improved FF in all probed light intensities ( Figure 6c ). 17 Figure 6d plots the PCEs versus the light intensity , which shows a consistently higher PCE of the DIO processed device than that of the device processed without additives under 25 all light intensities . Aiming to integrate the unique features of angular - shaped \" donor \" moiety and Se heteroatom to obtain both a low optical band gap and a low - lying HOMO level in D-A copolymers , we designed and synthesized a novel D-A copolymer PBDSe - DTBT composed of angular - shaped \" donor \" moiety of benzo[2,1-b:3,4- PC71BM blends. After further device optimizations with various polymer : PCBM ratios , and using 1% DIO as the processing additive , the PCE of PBDSe - DTBT : PC71BM based BHJ devices could reach an impressive value of 5.6% , mainly due to a much improved J sc ( 12.30 mA cm^-2 ) and a dramatically enhanced FF ( 0.57 ) upon adding 1% DIO as the processing additive. The 1% DIO processed solar cells showed more balanced hole and electron transport and reduced charge recombination losses , which can be ascribed to closer intermolecular stacking of the polymers in BHJ films and better BHJ film morphology. Our 50 results demonstrate that angular - shaped benzo[2,1-b:3,4b']diselenophene ( BDSe ) is a promising building block for future design of highly efficient donor polymers for BHJ solar cells. Further molecular engineering of this interesting building block and related D-A polymers are therefore justified. 55 The authors are grateful to NSFC for funding through Grant ( 51073124 and 21031006 ) .",

    "sentence": "Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted considerable attention in recent years for their advantages over inorganic solar cells , such as easy fabrication , light weight , flexibility , low cost , and so forth. 1-4 The bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs have played a leading role in realizing high efficiency by forming a donor- accept bicontinuous interpenetrating network of a conjugated polymer donor and soluble fullerene derivative ( such as [6,6]phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 60 BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) ) acceptor. 5 The key issue in the studies of PSCs is the design and synthesis of high efficiency donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials. 1-4,6 For the conjugated polymer donor materials , broad absorption spectra , higher hole mobility , and relatively lower HOMO energy level are key points for realizing high efficiency. One of the most popular approaches is to design and synthesize donor-acceptor ( D-A ) low - bandgap copolymers. 7-22 Among the various donor ( electron - rich ) moieties used in the D-A copolymer photovoltaic materials , dithienosilole ( DTS ) and benzodithiophene ( BDT ) are currently two of the most preferred donor units because of their good electron - donating properties , rigid coplanar structure with stronger π-π intermolecular interactions , and the possibility of side - chain manipulation for suitable solubility ( or processability ). 1,12,13,20-23 The PSCs based on the DTS-or BDT - containing polymers as donor and PC 70 BM as acceptor showed high power conversion efficiency up to 6-7 % . 1,21,23c In our previous work , we have synthesized two D-A copolymers PDTSBTz ( which is P3 in ref 24a ) and PBDTBTz ( ref 24b ) ( see Scheme 1 ) based on bithiazole ( BTz ) as acceptor unit and dithenosilole ( DTS ) or benzodithiophene ( BDT ) as donor unit with thiophene π-bridges between the donor and acceptor units. The two polymers exhibited hole mobilities of 3.07 x 10^-4 and 6.84 x 10^-4 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively , and the polymer solar cell based on these two polymers showed PCE of 2.86% and 3.82% , respectively. In order to attain more extended copolymers , 25 here we synthesized two bithiophene (BT)-bridged D-A copolymers , PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz , based on bithiazole as acceptor unit ( compound 3 in Scheme 2 ) and DTS or BDT as donor unit by Stille - coupling reaction. The two copolymers exhibit broad absorption , relatively lower HOMO energy level at ca. -5.10 eV and higher hole mobilities of ca. 1.8 x 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ). PCE of the PSCs based on PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz reached 3.82% and 4.46% , respectively. These results indicate that the bithiophene - bridged D-A copolymers are promising photovoltaic donor materials for the application in PSCs . Synthesis and Thermal Stability.

    "sentence": "ABSTRACT : Two bithiophene - bridged D-A copolymers , PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz , based on bithiazole acceptor unit and dithienosiole ( DTS ) or benzodithiophene ( BDT ) donor unit , were synthesized by the Pd - catalyzed Stille - coupling reaction. The two copolymers exhibit good thermal stability , strong absorption in the visible region , and relatively lower HOMO energy level at ca. -5.10 eV. The hole mobilities of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz measured by SCLC method are 1.85 x 10^-3 and 1.77 x 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively. Power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymer solar cell ( PSC ) based on PDTSBTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) was 3.82% with J sc = 8.68 mA / cm^2 , V oc = 0.72 V , and FF = 0.611 , under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2. In contrast , the PCE of the PSC based on PBDTBTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) reached 4.46% with J sc = 9.01 mA / cm^2 , V oc = 0.82 V , and FF = 0.603. These results indicate that bithiophene - bridged D-A copolymers are promising photovoltaic donor materials for the application in PSCs. The alternative copolymers of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz were synthesized by Stille - coupling reaction. The two copolymers have good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , toluene , and chlorobenzene. Molecular weights and polydispersity indices ( PDIs ) of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration , and the results are listed in Table 1. The number - average molecular weights ( M n ) of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz are 9.1 and 8.6 K , respectively. Although the molecular weights are relatively low , they are higher than those of the corresponding thiophene - bridged D-A copolymers PDTSBTz 24a and PBDTBTz. 24b Thermal stability of the polymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure 1. The TGA analysis reveals that the onset temperatures with 5% weight loss ( T d ) of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz are 425 and 343 °C , respectively. In comparison , Tdof PDTSBTz is 368 °C 24a and that of PBDTBTz is 317 ° C. 24b Obviously , the thermal stability of the bithiophene - bridged D-A copolymers is better than that of the corresponding thiophene - bridged copolymers. Absorption Spectra. Figure 2 shows the ultraviolet-visible ( UV-vis ) absorption spectra of the polymer dilute solutions in chloroform and films spin - coated on quartz substrates. The detailed absorption data , including absorption maximum wavelength of the polymer solutions and films , the absorption edge ( onset wavelength of the absorption peak , λ onset ) of the polymer films , and the optical bandgap deduced from the absorption edges , are summarized in Table 2.",

    "sentence": "PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz solutions in CHCl 3 show similar absorption spectra with the absorption maxima at 485 and 490 nm , respectively. Compared with the absorption spectra of the polymer solutions , the absorption maxima of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz films red - shifted by 65 and 45 nm , respectively , which indicates that there was strong π-π stacking and interchain interaction in PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz films. In addition , the absorption spectra of PBDTBTBTz and PDTSBTBTz films exhibited an apparent shoulder peak similar to that of poly(3hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , which means that there was good alignment in the polymer chains. Interestingly , the shoulder peaks of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz films are stronger than those of their corresponding thiophene - bridged D-A copolymers PDTSBTz and PBDTBTz films , 24 indicating that the bithiophene bridges between the DTS or BDT donor unit and the bithiazole acceptor unit in PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz benefitted the π-π stacking and ordered aggregation of the polymer main chains. The absorption edges ( λ edge ) of the two polymer films are 655 nm for PDTSBTBTz and 630 nm for PBDTBTBTz , from which the optical bandgaps ( E g opt ) of the polymers can be calculated according to E g opt = 1240 / λ edge . The E g opt values of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz are 1.89 and 1.96 eV , respectively. X-ray Diffraction. Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) patterns of the copolymers PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz. There are a sharp peaks in the XRD pattern of PDTSBTBTz at small angle of 2θ = 5.11 ° with d 1 = 17.3 Å. While in the XRD pattern of PBDTBTBTz , these are only a weak peak in the lowangle region ( d 1 = 17.8 Å ). The peaks correspond to the distance between main chains of the conjugated polymers separated by the alkyl side chains. 26 In comparison with regioregular P3HT where the lamellar d-spacing is 16.4 Å , 27 the copolymers have larger lamellar d-spacing. It is obvious that the packing of polymer chains for PDTSBTBTz is tighter than that of PBDTBTBTz. Electrochemical Properties. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was performed for determining the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the conjugated polymers. 28 Figure 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the PDTSBTBTz .77 V vs Ag / Ag + , respectively , while the onset oxidation potentials ( j ox ) are 0.36 and 0.41 V vs Ag / Ag + , respectively. HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated according to the equations 29 HOMO = -e(j ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ) and LUMO = -e(j red + 4.71 ) ( eV ). The results of the electrochemical measurements are listed in Table 2. The LUMO energy levels of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz are -2.92 and -2.94 eV , respectively , and the HOMO energy levels of PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz are -5.07 and -5.12 eV , respectively.",

    "sentence": "The relatively lower HOMO energy level of the copolymers is beneficial to the better stability of the polymers against oxidation and higher open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of the PSCs based on the polymers as donor. 15 Hole Mobility. Hole mobility is another important parameter for the conjugated polymer donor photovoltaic materials. Here we measured the hole mobility of the copolymers PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz by space - charge limit current ( SCLC ) method using a device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer / Au.

The results are plotted as ln(JL 3 / V 2 ) vs Scheme 2. Synthetic Route for Monomer 3 and Copolymers ( V / L ) 0.5 ( as shown in Figure 5 ). According to eq 1 and Figure 5 , the hole mobilities obtained are 1.85 x 10^-3 and 1.77 x 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) for PDTSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz , respectively. The hole mobilities of the corresponding thiophenebridged copolymers PDTSBTz and PBDTBTz are 3.07 x 10^-4 and 6.84 x 10^-4 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively. 24 Obviously , the hole mobility of the bithiophene - bridged copolymers PD - TSBTBTz and PBDTBTBTz is improved over that of their corresponding thiophene - bridged copolymers , and the higher hole mobility of the bithiophene - bridged D-A copolymers should be beneficial for the application as photovoltaic donor materials in PSCs. Photovoltaic Properties. To investigate and compare the photovoltaic properties of the two copolymers , bulk heterojunction PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / copolymer : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) / Ca / Al were fabricated. Figure 6 shows the J-V curves of the PSCs under the illumination of AM1.5 , 100 mW / cm^2. The corresponding open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , short - circuit current ( J sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the devices are summarized in Table 3. The photovoltaic properties of the corresponding thiophene - bridged D-A copolymers PDTSBTz and PBDTBTz are also listed in Table 3 for comparison.",

    "sentence": "The PSCs based on the blend of PDTSBTBTz or PBDTBTBTz and PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) exhibited higher V oc of 0.72 and 0.82 V , respectively. When increasing PC 70 BM content to the weight ratio of the polymer to PC 70 BM of 1 : 2 , the J sc and FF values of devices slightly decreased , which could be ascribed to the reduction of the absorption of the active layer and an unbalanced charge transporting properties between holes and electrons due to the high PC 70 BM content. 31 The best device based on PDTSBTBTz showed a V oc of 0.72 V , a J sc of 8.68 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.611 , leading to a PCE of 3.82% . The maximum PCE of the PSC based on PBDTBTBTz reached 4.46% with a V oc of 0.82 V , a J sc of 9.01 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.603. In comparison with the PCE of 2.86% 24a for PDTSBTz and 3.82% 24b for PBDTBTz , the power conversion efficiency of the bithiophenebridged D-A copolymers is improved significantly over that of their corresponding thiophene - bridged copolymers. The better photovoltaic performance of the bithiophene - bridged copolymers could be ascribed to their higher hole mobilities mentioned above. Figure 7 demonstrates the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) curves of the PSCs based on the two copolymers. The EQE curve of the PSC based on PDTSBTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) covers a broad wavelength range from 350 to 700 nm with the maximum EQE value of 59.5% at ca. 550 nm and a platform from 450 to 570 nm. In contrast , the EQE curve of the PSC based on PBDTBTBTz : PC 70 BM ( 1 : 1 w / w ) exhibits a higher EQE value of 71.1% at 500 nm. The higher EQE values of the PSC based on PBDTBTBTz agree with the higher J sc of the PSC device mentioned above. In order to understand the effect of mophology of the photoactive layers on the photovoltaic performance of the polymer solar cells , the mophological structures of the blend films of polymer : PC 70 BM was analyzed by tapping mode atom force microscopy ( AFM ) measurements ( as shown in Figure S1 in Supporting Information ). It is clear that the film of 1 : 1 blends of polymer and PC 70 BM have better interpenetrating network than that of 1 : 2 blend of polymer and PC 70 BM which is beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport. This is consistent with the higher performance of polymer solar cells based on the blend of polymer and PC 70 BM with weight ratio of 1 : 1 .

    "sentence": "1a,5 With these synergistic efforts , single - junction PSCs with PCEs over 9% have been achieved. 3d One of key components of PSCs is the active layer , which determines the maximum amount of the harvested solar light and the largest open - circuit voltage ( V oc ). So far , most efficient PSCs have to use the fullerene derivatives ( such as PC61BM and PC71BM ) as the acceptor materials in the active layer. Therefore , new p - type conjugated polymers should be designed to match the LUMO energy levels of the fullerene derivatives. An ideally p - type conjugated polymer should possess relatively small band gaps , high hole mobilities , appropriate energy levels , good solubility , and miscibility with the fullerene derivatives. 2g,6 To satisfy the above prerequisites , D-A ( electron donor- electron acceptor ) copolymers are widely designed and synthesized because of their low band gaps , deep - lying HOMO energy levels , and high hole mobilities. 7 The ladder - type aromatic molecules have a planar aromatic structure constructed by linking different aromatic units such as benzene or thiophene via a bridging atom , and they are promising monomers among various donor units due to their salient features. 8 First , various alkyl chains can be easily introduced into the polymer backbone to get good solubility of the rigid - rod - like polymers in common organic solvents. Second , an extended π-conjugation of the ladder - type molecule based polymer endows a broader , more intense absorption band , resulting in enhanced solar light harvesting. 9 Third , integration of several aromatic rings into a rigid and coplanar backbone may facilitate a better π-electron delocalization , 10 reduce energetic disorder of the polymer , 7b and induce strong intermolecular interactions between polymer chains for efficient charge transportion. 2g Recently , a number of ladder - type molecule based copolymers have been designed and synthesized for efficient PSCs. Zheng et al. developed ladder - type oligo-p-phenylene containing copolymers for PSCs with a V oc as high as 1.06 V. 9 By replacing benzene rings of the oligo-pphenylene with thiophenes , a heteroaromatic ladder - type structure , i.e. , indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) , is formed , which is another popular building block for p - type conjugated polymers for organic field effect transistor ( OFET ) and PSC applications. 11 Therefore , researchers are further motivated to modify the IDT backbone by altering the bridging atoms or side chains to tune the polymer crystallinity for better charge transport or light absorption 8,12 or by replacing the benzene ring or end - capped thiophene with a larger fused aromatic ring , such as dibenzo [b,d]thiophene , 1d carbazole , 13 fluorene , 14 silafluorene , 2g benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes , 15 thieno[3,2b]thiophene , 2h,16 benzo [c][1,2,5]thiadiazole ( BT ) , quinoxaline , 17 etc. , to generate a vast variety of extended ladder - type aromatic building blocks for copolymers.",

The optical , electrochemical , and electrical properties of these polymers are Scheme 1. Synthesis of the New Ladder - Type DTN Monomer Scheme 2. Synthesis of New Ladder - Type DTN - Based Copolymers investigated together with their preliminary photovoltaic performance. Partially due to the donor - acceptor structure configuration , all three polymers exhibit lower band gaps compared to that of the most studied polymer P3HT. Both conventional and inverted solar cell devices are fabricated by using these conjugated polymers as donor materials and the PC71BM as the acceptor material. With the relatively higher hole mobility , the deeper - lying HOMO energy level , inverted devices based on PDTNTBT exhibit a higher PCE of 5.0% in comparison with those based on the other two copolymers . Synthesis. The synthetic routes for the copolymers and the monomer ( DTN ) are depicted in Schemes 1 and 2. The key intermediate , 2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,5-dicarboxylic acid ( 2 ) , was prepared according to a literature procedure. 18 Compound 2 was then esterified to get dimethyl-2,6dibromonaphthalene-1,5-dicarboxylate ( 3 ) in 93% yield. Stille coupling of compound 3 with tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane afforded compound 4. The two ester groups of compound 4 were hydrolyzed to afford a dicarboxylic acid derivative ( 5 ) , which was then converted to a dicarboxylic acid chloride by reacting with oxalyl chloride. Intramolecular Friedel - Crafts acylation of the dicarboxylic acid chloride regioselectively occurred at the 3-positions of the end - capped thiophenes to yield compound 6. By converting two carbonyl groups in compound 6 to the corresponding methylene groups by the Wolff - Kishner reduction , compound 7 was obtained. Alkylation of compound 7 with 2-ethylhexyl bromide afforded compound 8 in a yield of 40% . The DTN monomer was synthesized in 95% yield from compound 8 by lithium- hydrogen exchange reaction in the presence of n-butyllithium followed by a reaction with trimethyltin chloride.

    "sentence": "The molecular weights ( M n ) of PDTNTDPP , PDTNTBT , and PDTNBT are 6.8K , 12.1K , and 5.1K , respectively , with relatively narrow PDIs in the range of 1.3- 1.6 ( Table 1 ). We noticed that the molecular weights of these three polymers are not high due to the low purity of DTN during the polymerization. It should be noted that it is difficult to purify the liquid monomer DTN by the common purification methods such as recrystallization or column chromatography. The structures of the target polymers were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. All polymers show good solubility in common organic solvents , such as chloroform , toluene , chlorobenzene , and dichlorobenzene , due to the four 2-ethylhexyl chains in the ladder - type DTN repeat unit. Optical Properties. The absorption spectra of the target polymers in chlorobenzene solutions ( 1 × 10^-5 M ) and in thin films on glass substrates are shown in Figure 1 , and the data are summarized in Table 1. All the three copolymers exhibit one main broad absorption band in both dilute solutions and thin films. As shown in Figure 1a , the absorption maxima are 555 , 623 , and 711 nm for PDTNTBT , PDTNBT , and PDTNTDPP in chlorobenzene , respectively. In going from solution to solid state film ( Figure 1b ) , no significant differences are observed for the absorption spectra , except that there is a 20-30 nm redshifted absorption for the film. The electron - withdrawing properties of the acceptors have a strong effect on the absorption bands of the copolymers. The introduction of a strong acceptor with extended π-conjugation length ( such as TDPP ) into the DTN containing polymer backbone leads to a polymer with red - shifted absorption , and a weaker acceptor ( such as TBT ) leads to the polymer with blue - shifted absorption. The optical band gaps deduced from the onset of the thin film absorption spectra are in the following order : PDTNTDPP ( 1.50 eV ) < PDTNBT ( 1.72 eV ) < PDTNTBT ( 1.78 eV ). Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was used to investigate the electrochemical properties and estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the target polymers. Figure 2 shows the cyclic voltammetry of the polymer films on a Pt disk electrode in 0.1 mol / L Bu 4 NPF 6 acetonitrile solutions. Under this condition , the onset oxidation potential ( E 1 / 2 ox ) of ferrocence was -0.02 V versus Ag / Ag + . The CV curves were calibrated using ferrocence as the standard , whose HOMO energy level is set at -4.80 eV. 19 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the band gaps of the polymers were calculated according to the following equations , 20 and the data are listed in Table 1.",

The HOMO energy levels ( Figure 3 ) were calculated to be -5.21 eV for PDTNTDPP , -5.36 eV for PDTNTBT , and -5.30 eV for PDTNBT , which are in good agreement with the ideal HOMO energy levels to ensure good air stability and high open circuit voltage ( V oc ) in polymer solar cells. 21 The LUMO levels are located at -3.46 eV for PDTNTDPP , -3.42 eV for PDTNTBT , and -3.44 eV for PDTNBT , which are much higher than that of PC71BM ( -4.3 eV ) to guarantee an energetically favorable electron transfer. Photovoltaic Properties and Hole Mobilities. Hole only devices ( ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au ) were fabricated in order to estimate the hole mobilities of these polymers by the space - charge limited current ( SCLC ) method. The J 0.5 versus V ap -V bi -V r plots of the polymer : PC71BM blended films are shown in the Supporting Information ( Figure S2 ). The SCLC hole mobilities of these polymers follow this trend : PDTNBT ( 2.07 × 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) < PDTNTDPP ( 2.44 × 10^-6 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) < PDTNTBT ( 2.13 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). Obviously , as a donor material , PDTNTBT will have some advantages in the photovoltaic application compared to the other two polymers due to its much higher hole mobility. In order to investigate the potentials of these copolymers in photovoltaics , two sets of BHJ PSCs were fabricated with the device configurations of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / PIFB / Al and ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag , respectively. The copolymer : PC71BM blended films were prepared in a weight ratio of 1 : 3 using mixed solvents ( chlorobenzene:odichlorobenzene = 4 : 1 ) for the conventional solar cells , while the blend ratio was changed to 1 : 2 ( copolymer : PC71BM ) for the inverted devices. In fact , before the comparison on the performance of the optimized devices , we also fabricated the S1 and Figure S3 ).",

The V oc , short - circuit current ( J sc ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and PCE of the PSCs are summarized in Table 2. For the conventional devices , the PSC based on PDTNTDPP exhibited a V oc of 0.75 V , a J sc of 3.95 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 51.5% , resulting in a PCE of 1.52% . For PDTNBT , a significantly improved J sc of 6.82 mA / cm^2 and an increased V oc of 0.85 V were observed , although the FF decreased slightly compared to PDTNTDPP , all of which leads to an improved PCE of 2.79% . In the case of PDTNTBT , the PSC exhibits a higher PCE of 4.78% with a J sc of 10.29 mA / cm^2 , a V oc of 0.86 V , and an FF of 53.8% . Here , the much higher hole mobility of PDTNTBT : PC71BM blends and slightly deeper lying HOMO energy level of PDTNTBT lead to the higher efficiency of the PDTNTBT : PC71BM - based devices. Compared to conventional PSCs , inverted solar cell devices possess better long - term ambient stability because a more stable high work - function metal electrode is used and the acidic PEDOT : PSS layer is replaced by other stable anode buffer layers. 23,24 The inverted devices based on PDTNTDPP , PDTNBT , and PDTNTBT exhibit PCEs of 1.60% , 2.89% , and 4.82% , respectively , following a similar trend to the conventional devices. Notably , the PCEs of all inverted PSCs are slightly larger than their corresponding conventional devices. The improved efficiencies for the inverted devices are mainly due to the increased FFs ( 55.8% versus 50.2% for the PDTNTDPP system , 59.6% versus 53.8% for the PDTNTBT system , and 50.4% versus 48.1% for the PDTNBT system ). Interestingly , after storage in air for 10 days , the inverted devices based on PDTNTBT : PC71BM exhibit a higher PCE of 5.0% with a V oc of 0.84 V , a J sc of 9.96 mA / cm^2 , and an FF of 0.596. External Quantum Efficiency. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) curves of PSCs under monochromatic light illumination are shown in Figure 5. PSCs based on PDTNTBT exhibit a much higher maximum EQE value of 65% at 478 nm compared to those based on PDTNTDPP and PDTNBT. However , PSCs based on PDTNTDPP and PDTNBT exhibit a broader spectral response range compared to those based on PDTNTBT , which is in agreement with the optical absorption spectra of their blended films with PC71BM in the same ratio ( Figure S1 ).",

    "sentence": "The EQE values of PSCs based on PDTNTBT are about 2-3 times higher than those based on the other two copolymers. Similar results were observed for the inverted devices based on polymer : PC71BM blends in the weight ratio of 1 : 2 ( Figure S4 ). Accordingly , PDTNTBT - based devices show a larger photocurrent and a higher overall PCE than the PDTNTDPP-or PDTNBT - based devices. At the same time , the higher hole mobility of the PDTNTBT blend also contributes to the higher EQE of the PSC based on it. Morphology and Device Stability Studies. For polymer solar cells , the morphological control of the BHJ active layer plays an important role in charge generation , separation , and transport , which could influence their device performance. In this work , the morphology of thin films was evaluated by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). The AFM topography ( left ) and phase ( right ) images are shown in Figure 6. The film of PDTNBT / PC71BM ( 1 : 3 , w / w ) showed clear phase separation with some aggregation and a relatively high surface roughness of 1.05 nm. The surface roughnesses of blended films based on PDTNTDPP and PDTNTBT based were 0.39 and 0.47 nm , respectively. Although with a smooth surface morphology of the active layer , the device based on PDTNTDPP has a low J sc value which can be attributed to its low mobility. And the blended film based on PDTNTBT is smooth and uniform as shown in the left of Figure 6b , which is beneficial for achieving high performance devices. In the phase image of the blended films , small phase separation domains of ∼ 15-20 nm size are clearly observed , which is an important prerequisite for efficient charge separation and transport. 25 Stability is very important for the real use of PSCs. Figure 7 shows the PCE of the inverted device based on PDTNTBT : PC71BM during a two month period. As shown in the figure , the inverted device has good performance with a PCE of 4.82% initially , and 10 days later , an increased PCE of 5.0% was achieved. After 60 days of storage in air , the device still exhibits a high PCE of 4.75% , which retains 95% of its highest efficiency. The excellent stability observed for the inverted PSCs based on PDTNTBT suggests a good potential of ladder - type DTN - based copolymers for photovoltaic applications. It should be noted that with a better encapsulation of the inverted device a further improvement in stability could be achieved . In summary , we have successfully designed and synthesized a novel ladder - type electron - rich unit ( DTN ) for constructing three donor - acceptor copolymers with tunable band gaps from 1.75 to 1.94 eV and variable HOMO levels from -5.36 to -5.21 eV.",

    "sentence": "In this study we report the molecular design , synthesis , characterization , and photovoltaic properties of a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) and dithienothiophene ( DTT ) based donor - acceptor random copolymers. The six random copolymers are obtained via Stille coupling polymerization using various concentration ratios of donor to acceptor in the conjugated backbone. Bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene was used as the bridge block to link randomly with the two comonomers 5-(bromothien-2-yl)-2,5- The optical properties of these copolymers clearly reveal a change in the absorption band through optimization of the donor - acceptor ratio in the backbone. Additionally , the solution processability of the copolymers is modified through the attachment of different bulky alkyl chains to the lactam N - atoms of the DPP moiety. Applications of the polymers as light - harvesting and electron - donating materials in solar cells , in conjunction with PCBM as acceptor , show power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of up to 5.02% . Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells , comprising interpenetrating networks of a donor polymer semiconductor and a fullerene derivative acceptor such as [6,6]-phenyl-C 61butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) , have attracted a great deal of attention by virtue of their easy solution processability , mechanical exibility , and the low - cost large - area manufacturing. 1 Organic photovoltaic ( OPV ) devices based on these materials are predicted to have a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of close to 10% based on some theoretical models if a suitable low band gap donor material has been developed. 2 In order to obtain high - performance photovoltaic polymer materials , it is necessary to design and synthesize novel conjugated donor polymers with ideal characteristics such as broad absorption spectrum for efficient sunlight harvesting and high mobility for effective charge carrier transportation to the electrodes. Large short - circuit current density ( J sc ) , good ll factor ( FF ) and high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) are important parameters for getting high PCE in OPV devices and these factors can be achieved by modulating appropriate molecular energy levels with good charge carrier mobility of the semiconducting material. 3 Dithieno[3,2-b : 2^0 ,3 0 -d]thiophene ( DTT ) is a classic condensed aromatic moiety that has been explored previously for making various classes of electronically active or semiconducting materials. 4 DTT based small molecules have been successfully reported and used for various applications such as organic light emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , non-linear optics , photochromics , organic thin lm transistors ( OTFTs ) , and OPV. 5,6 However , there are few reports on DTT - based semiconducting polymers , presumably due to their inherently poor solubility and processability. 7,8 The introduction of long alkyl side - chains to the b-positions of the DTT unit would be an excellent approach for making them easily solution - processable.",

    "sentence": "9 We have recently synthesized one copolymer based on 3,5-dipentadecyldithieno [ 3,2-b ; 2^0 ,3 0 -d]thiophene , PBTDTT-15 , which exhibited a high OTFT mobility of 0.06 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . In addition , blends of PBTDTT-15 and PC71BM have achieved promising solar cell PCEs of up to 3.2% . 9b,c Considering the relatively narrow absorption spectrum of PBTDTT-15 , which has an absorption onset of around 640 nm , the OPV results suggest that the dialkyl-substituted DTT would be a promising building block for donor polymers. Combining the electron - donating DTT moiety with an electron - accepting moiety can create a novel push - pull type copolymer with a lower band - gap and better photonabsorption characteristics. Such a combination will also modulate the energy levels for further improvement in solar cell performances. Among various reported push - pull based materials , recently diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based molecules and polymers are gaining signicant attention in the research community due to their excellent properties such as high stability , weather fastness , large extinction coefficient , and electron - decient nature. 10 3,6-Dithien-2-yl-2,5-dialkylpyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione ( DTDPP ) is one of the important segments which was signicantly investigated for making an interesting class of DPP based materials for various applications including unipolar and ambipolar OFETs to OPVs. 11,12 In our study , we used a DTDPP unit as the acceptor block , and the dipentadecyl-substituted DTT unit as the donor segment. By combining DPP with DTT we expect to create a novel condensed aromatic push - pull conjugated backbone system with wide absorption spectrum and good charge transporting ability. Bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene was used as the bridging unit to link the dibrominated monomers of 3,6-bis(5bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-dialkylpyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione and 2,6-dibromo-3,5-dipentadecyl-dithieno[3,2-b ; 2^0 ,3 0 -d]thiophene through the Stille coupling polymerization. In contrast to most investigated donor - acceptor ( D-A ) type copolymers , which have been synthesized in alternating fashion , our copolymers are random by nature and the donor - acceptor blocks are incorporated randomly in the main conjugated backbone. This design strategy is benecial because of easy tailoring in the comonomer ( donor , acceptor or linking blocks ) feed ratio , which controls the optical and electronic properties of the copolymer. 17 In our previous communication , we reported a random D-A copolymer based on DPP and DTT moieties , which shows promising high power conversion eciency. 18 In this article a systematic exploration of the structure - property relationship was carried out on this type of random D-A copolymer. A series of copolymers PDPP-T-DTT have been consecutively designed and synthesized ( Scheme 1 ). The copolymers 1-3 with different ratios of dodecyl chain attached DPP to DTT moieties were rst prepared in this series and were found to have relatively poor solubility in common organic solvents , being soluble only in chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene. In spite of this , promising solar cell PCEs greater than 3% were achieved for these polymers ( vide infra ).",

    "sentence": "The best performance was offered by copolymer 2 which possesses balanced optical absorption from the UV to near IR region , thus we set out to improve the solubility and processability of this kind of polymer by replacing the straight dodecyl chain with branched alkyl chains such as 2ethylhexyl , 2-butyloctyl and 2-octyldodecyl , respectively. Polymers 4 to 6 which have different branched alkyl chains but the same comonomer feed ratio ( the same as copolymer 2 ) were synthesized and further evaluated in OPV devices. The best OPV performance was demonstrated by copolymer 5 , where a typical cell device of ITO / PEDOT - PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Ag , under simulated AM1.5 G conditions , exhibited V oc of 0.584 V , J sc of 12.76 mA cm^-1 , and FF of 67.27% , resulting in a PCE of 5.02% . Our systematic study has demonstrated that high OPV performance can be realized in randomly linked donor - acceptor copolymers. These results might open up new avenues to material chemists on the new molecular design for high performance OPV polymers . In order to determine the thermal properties of the copolymers , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetry ( TGA ) analyses of copolymers have been carried out. All of the copolymers exhibited excellent thermal stability with 5% weight loss temperatures between 370 and 420 °C ( Fig. 1 ). By comparing the 5% weight loss temperatures of copolymers 2 , 4 , 5 and 6 , in which the ratio between DPP and DTT moieties is the same but the alkyl chains attached to DPP are different , it can be observed that the thermal stability of the polymers decreased slightly as the bulk of the alkyl chains increased. DSC scans on the copolymers 1 to 4 revealed no clear thermal transitions from room temperature to 350 C. Copolymers 5 and 6 , however , had sharp melting peaks at 284 °C and 258 °C respectively ( Fig. 2 ) , indicating that the bulky branched alkyl chains on DPP impact not only on the polymer solubility but also the polymer chains packing in the solid state . The optical properties of the copolymers were studied by UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. The solution and thin lm absorption spectra for copolymers 1-6 are shown in Fig. 3. Two distinct absorption bands were observed , which can be attributed to the p-p* transition from DTT segments ( short wavelength region of 370-600 nm ) 9b and D-A charge - transfer transition ( long wavelength region of 600-910 nm ). The solution and lm spectra were similar , although the absorbance of all the polymers at the short wavelength region was relatively enhanced in the lm. When the ratio of the DTT units in the copolymers 1-3 was increased , absorbance in the short wavelength region increased relative to that of the long wavelength region.",

    "sentence": "In the lm of copolymer 2 , the absorptions in the short wavelength region and the long wavelength region were almost equal ; further increases in the DTT content caused the absorption in the short wavelength region to exceed that in the long wavelength region. For the copolymers 4-6 , the absorption intensities at both short and long wavelength bands remain almost unchanged , showing that the attachment of different alkyl chains does not affect the electron delocalization along the polymer backbone. The optical band - gaps of copolymers 1-6 were determined from their absorption onsets of around 910 nm , which corresponded to a band - gap of 1.37 eV. Compared with PBTDTT-15 , the band - gaps of PDPP-T-DTT series are 0.56 eV lower due to the combination of the DPP acceptor moiety with the DTT donor moiety , this combination forms a push - pull conjugated system which results in hybridization of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of the donor with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of the acceptor. 9b The absorption onsets for all the copolymers are red - shied by around 270 nm to the near infrared region , indicating that these polymers have great potential for effective photon - harvesting. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed in order to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. All CV measurements were recorded in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexauorophosphate solution in dry acetonitrile at a scanning rate of 100 mV s^-1 . The glassy carbon working electrode was coated with the polymer thin lm by using a polymer solution in chlorobenzene. All the polymers had very similar oxidation onset potentials of around 0.35 - 0.45 V vs. Fc / Fc + ( Fig. 4 ) , which translate to HOMO levels of between -5.15 eV and -5.25 eV. 21 The polymer with the deepest HOMO level was copolymer 1 ( m : n = 1 : 1 ) at -5.25 eV ; increasing the DTT content caused the HOMO level to increase marginally to -5.24 eV for copolymer 2 ( m : n = 1 : 2 ) and -5.19 eV for copolymer 3 ( m : n = 1 : 3 ). Copolymers 4 to 6 had HOMO levels of between -5.15 and -5.18 eV , which were slightly higher than those of copolymer 2 .

Active layers with thicknesses of around 120 nm were obtained by spincoating blend solutions. No thermal treatment was applied in the device fabrication process. The results are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. From the results , it can be seen that the highest PCE was 2.06% for copolymer 1 , 3.58% for copolymer 2 , and 3.06% for copolymer 3. The best ratio of polymer to PC61BM varied between the polymers , with copolymer 1 requiring a 1 : 4 ratio , copolymer 2 a 1 : 2 ratio and copolymer 3 a 1 : 1 ratio. For all 3 polymers , it was observed that an increase in the PC61BM content resulted in a slight decrease in the V oc . This has previously been observed for other donor polymers , such as MDMO - PPV , AFPO3 , P3HTV and PF10TBT. 22 The reduction in the V oc correlated with the decrease in the energy of the charge transfer ( CT ) states with increasing PC61BM concentrations. 22c It is observed that copolymer 2 ( m : n = 1 : 2 ) gave the best results among the three copolymers 1-3. Replacing PC61BM by PC71BM in the blend with copolymer 2 resulted in a device with J sc of 12.91 mA cm^-2 , V oc of 0.505 V , FF of 58.41% and PCE of 3.81% . The increase in PCE was due to an increase in the J sc ( 12.91 vs. 10.93 mA cm^-2 for the case of PC61BM ) , which can be attributed to the better absorption properties of PC71BM compared to PC61BM. 23 However , the general OPV performance does not improve much as we expect when compared to PBTDTT - 15. This is probably due to the poor solubility of three copolymers 1-3. Thus copolymers 4 , 5 and 6 were synthesized with different N-branched alkyl substituents ( 2-ethylhexyl , 2butyloctyl and 2-octyldodecyl respectively ) with the same 1 : 2 ratio in order to improve the processability of the polymer. It was observed that the solubility of copolymer 4 was similar to that of copolymer 2 and the solubilities of copolymers 5 and 6 were improved compared with copolymer 2. Copolymers 4 , 5 and 6 were tested in solar cells utilising a 1 : 2 weight ratio blend of polymer to PC71BM , and the results are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2. Comparing the performances of all the polymers in combination with PC61BM , it is observed that cells with copolymer 4 had a low PCE of 3.07% .",

    "sentence": "This could be attributed largely to a drop in the ll factor of the device , which we believe is due to reduced lm quality stemming from its poor solubility. Cells utilising copolymer 5 had a slightly higher J sc , V oc and FF than those of the copolymer 2 , resulting in an improved PCE of 4.39% . Furthermore , the substitution of PC71BM for PC61BM resulted in higher J sc values and improved PCE of 5.02% for copolymer 5. It is surprising that the performance of copolymer 6 in OPVs was much poorer although this polymer was much more soluble than their counterparts with shorter alkyl chains. Thus AFM studies ( Fig. 7 ) of the copolymer 5 : PC71BM and 6 : PC71BM devices were conducted to explore the cause of the poor performance for copolymer 6. It was observed that the domains in the copolymer 6 : PC71BM lm were 50-150 nm in size. Such large domain sizes are detrimental for charge separation as there is a greater likelihood of excitons recombining before they reach an interface where charge separation can take place. 24 The domains for the copolymer 5 : PC71BM lm were much smaller at around 20 nm , leading to much better charge separation and a higher short circuit current. Furthermore , for verifying the rationality of our strategy of donor - acceptor random copolymers for highly efficient organic photovoltaic applications , we intentionally prepared one donor - acceptor alternating copolymer based on DPP and DTT moieties ( copolymer 7 ) as shown in Scheme 1.^25 The bottomgate , top - contact thin lm transistor ( TFT ) devices were fabricated from copolymer 5 and copolymer 7 respectively in order to investigate how the donor - acceptor linkage style affects its charge transport properties. The two copolymers both showed p - type transporting characteristics and good current on / off ratios above 10^5 when measured in ambient conditions , the copolymer 7 presented much higher TFT performance over the copolymer 5 with saturation hole mobility of 0.11 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The hole mobility is at least one order of magnitude higher than that of copolymer 5 ( ca. 8.7 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) , 18 this is likely to be due to the random linkage of DTT donor and DPP acceptor units along the polymer backbone , which reduces the molecular ordering of copolymer 5 compared to the alternating - linked copolymer 7. The solar cell devices were fabricated using a blend of copolymer 7 and PC71BM with the same device structure as that for copolymer 5. Under the same measurement conditions , however , the devices with the 1 : 2 ratio by weight of copolymer 7 : PC71BM provided the highest PCE of 3.44% with V oc of 0.53 V , J sc of 9.91 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 65.65% , less than the OPV performance of copolymer 5.",

Currently , most low-band-gap polymers for OPV application are developed based on the strategy of alternating donor - acceptor along the polymer backbone. Our results in this study show that high OPV performance can also be obtained in a donoracceptor randomly incorporated copolymer through the optimization of the ratio between donor and acceptor units in the main chain and solution processability by attaching proper alkyl side chains , thus opening a new design strategy for developing high performance OPV materials. We note that the open circuit voltages of the cells in our current polymer system were close to 0.6 V , which could be a limitation on the performance of these cells. Thus , increasing the V oc of these cells could be the key to achieving increased power conversion efficiencies. The design and synthesis of new monomers and polymers with low - lying HOMO levels are in progress .",
