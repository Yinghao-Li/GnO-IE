    "sentence": "A novel series of low band gap donor - acceptor copolymers derived from 4,5bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) and 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4-alkylthien-2-yl)benzo [c][1,2,5]thiadiazole bearing various alkyl side chains , such as PffBB-n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , and 16 ) , were developed for high - performance bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). PffBB-n exhibited not only strong and wide absorption but also controllable aggregation behavior in solution and thin films , in which aggregation behavior was greatly influenced by the length of alkyl side chains attached , temperature applied , and solvent used. Aggregation - induced spectral broadening further extended the absorption cutoff to ∼ 780 nm in thin films , leading to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Because of the strong aggregation strength , PffBB-n equipped with long alkyl side chains shows enhanced ordered molecular packing and good crystallinity as revealed by X-ray diffraction studies. In addition , temperature - dependent aggregation of the PffBB-n:PC71BM blend was investigated and optimized in the PSC fabrication. PSCs fabricated with the PffBB-n:PC71BM blend , conducted at 80 °C optimized coating temperature , showed relatively high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) ranging from 8.22 to 9.93% . The well - ordered BHJ film morphology of the PffBB-14:PC71BM blend led to superior balanced charge carrier mobility , good exciton dissociation , and the least recombination loss and hence PffBB-14 - based PSC reached the highest photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 9.93% , a V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 and , a FF of 64.36% . Our results demonstrated that the synergetic effect of alkyl side chain modification and processing temperature modulation to control aggregation provides practical and powerful tools to optimize the absorption broadening and optoelectronic properties of an active layer in a BHJ PSC , thus enhancing its ultimate performance . Polymeric materials show promising potential for the applications of future solar cell technology because of their advantages of solution processability , lightweight , cost efficiency , and mechanical flexibility. 1 Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) with power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) exceeding 10% have been realized during the last decade , which was benefited from tremendous efforts on the development of advanced donor and / or acceptor materials , device engineering and optimized fabrication processes. 2-12 Nevertheless , the poor sunlight harvesting efficiency and low charge carrier mobility of organic semiconducting materials still hinder the further efficiency improvement of PSCs. Polythiophene ( PT ) materials have been proved to be promising donor materials as most PT materials exhibit high regioregularity for easy formation of well - organized active layer morphology , thus providing an auspicious way to develop new and efficient photovoltaic ( PV ) materials. 13-20 However , thiophene - based units are strongly electron - rich in nature , which often give rise to a high - lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level.",

    "sentence": "Such high energy alignment would not enable to achieve a large open - circuit voltage and is eventually detrimental to the PCE output of PT - based PSCs such as in P3HT / PCBM systems with PCE ranging from 3 to 4% . 21,22 Geng and co-workers synthesized two PT - based donor materials by incorporating carboxylate side chains and vinylene linkers between thiophene units. The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of the resulting polymers , PBT and PTT , were substantially stabilized when compared to those of the parent P3HT. Such energy level lowering was attributed to the integration of carboxylate and vinylene groups giving rise to a push - pull structural motif , resulting in an enhanced PCE of the PV devices based on them. 21 Over the years , the use of the structural effect to enhance PSC performance has been extensively investigated , particularly the donor - acceptor ( D-A ) strategy , which has been proved to be an effective approach to develop donor polymers with wide absorption , low - lying energy levels , and enhanced electron properties. 23-32 Besides , conjugation expansion on the polymer backbone is an alternative tool to improve the electronic properties of polymers. By replacing a branched 2ethylhexyl side chain with a linear n-octyl group , Zhang and his co-workers synthesized a PTB7-Th derivative namely , PBTT. PV cells based on PBTT : IEICO showed a superior device performance than that of the PTB7-Th - based device with a PCE of 9.5% , a V oc of 0.86 V , a J sc of 17.9 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 61.3% . Such dramatic enhancement in efficiency was attributed to a higher charge mobility and improved morphology of the PBTT : IEICO blend film induced by the less steric hindered linear alkyl side chain. 1 Yang and coworkers used selenophene to replace thiophene π-bridge in the indacenodithiophene (IDT)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD)-based copolymer ( PThBDDIDT ) to develop a donor-π-acceptor type copolymer , PSeBDDIDT. The PCE of solar cells based on polymer : PC71BM as an active layer was dramatically increased from 7.04 to 8.65% , respectively. Such improvement could result from stronger intermolecular interactions , expanded absorption range , and better molecular planarity of selenophene contained PSeBDDIDT. 33 Random terpolymers comprised of thieno[2′,3′ : 5′,6′]pyrido [ 3,4- g]- thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione , thiophene( T ) , and dithiophene ( 2T ) were synthesized by Yang and co-workers in which the crystallinity of terpolymers could be controlled by varying the compositions of T and 2T. The PSC based on a terpolymer with the optimized T / 2T ratio of 7 : 3 showed a high J sc of 18.3 mA cm^-2 and a FF of 71.2% , thus resulting in an enhanced PCE up to 10.8% . 34 Fluorination on polymer backbones has also been widely adopted to tune and improve the functional properties of donor polymers such as stabilization of their energy levels and hence positively impacting on PSC performance.",

The PSC based on J91 / m-ITIC as an active layer with thermal annealing gave a high PCE of 11.63% with a high V oc of 0.98 V and a J sc of 18.03 mA cm^-2 . 36 The improved cell performance was attributed to the suppression of carrier recombination imposed by the difluorosubstituted side chain. In addition to influencing molecular and functional properties of donor polymers , the structural modification could lead to severe aggregation , which could hamper solution processability of a polymer. On the other hand , aggregation could be desirable and provide a useful tool to control the bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) film morphology and then the photovoltaic performance of a solar cell. Yan and co-workers employed the branched alkyl chains attached on the backbone of the difluorobenzothiadiazole-quaterthiophene ( PffBT4T ) copolymer to acquire desirable temperature - dependent aggregation behavior. By spin - casting the polymer solution at an elevated temperature , they could control the morphology and crystallinity of the polymer films. Taking advantage of this aggregation control approach , high - performance PSCs based on PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM were fabricated affording a PCE of up to 10.8% . 9 Guo and co-workers used a number of fused thiophene spacers to tune the aggregation behavior of difluorobenzoxadiazole (ffBX)-based donor polymers among which PffBX-TT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as a spacer showed intermediate temperature - dependent aggregation strength allowing the control of blend film morphology during PSC fabrication. PSCs using PffBX-TT:PC71BM as an active layer gave a maximum PCE of 9.10% . 37 Previously , we developed a class of benzodithiophene - based donor polymers with fluoro-dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole being an acceptor unit that showed interesting temperature - dependent aggregation behavior when equipped with linear alkyl side chains. PSCs based on these polymers : PC71BM blend layers showed good photovoltaic performance with a maximum PCE as high as 9.70% . 38 In this contribution , we reported a new series of donor polymer materials based on benzodithiophene ( BDT ) and difluorinated dialkylthienylbenzothiadiazole , PffBB-n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16 ) , which exhibited strong aggregation behavior in both solution and thin films. In addition to the size of alkyl side chains attached on the backbone of the polymer , aggregation can be modulated by the solvent used and temperature applied on the film with which the absorption cut - off extended down to ∼ 780 nm in thin films , resulting in a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Such wide absorption is desirable and complementary to that of the commonly used PC71BM acceptor material in the visible light region , which can increase light harvesting in BHJ PSCs.",

    "sentence": "BHJ PSCs with PffBBn : PC71BM active blend layer spin - coated at different temperatures showed considerably various photovoltaic performance because of the morphological order change of the blend layer at different processing temperatures. Among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs fabricated , PffBB-14 with strongest aggregation strength / behavior exhibited the most promising photovoltaic performance , with a maximum PCE of 9.93% , a large V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36% . Such a superior device efficiency was attributed to the greatly enhanced exciton dissociation , higher and balanced charge carrier mobilities , and less recombination losses in the active layer of the PffBB-14:PC71BM - based cells. Our results demonstrated that the modulation of aggregation behavior through structural modification and temperature tuning could effectively optimize the physical and optoelectronic properties of a material and device for solar cell applications . Synthesis and Physical Properties of Polymers. The PffBB-n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16 ) polymers were synthesized according to the optimized literature procedures and the synthetic scheme is shown in Scheme 1.^39 The Corey - House synthesis of 3-bromothiophene and oxalyl dichloride gave 1,2di(thiophen-3-yl)ethane-1,2-dione ( 1 ) as a brown needle - like crystal in a good yield ( 70% ). Oxidative cyclization of 1 in the presence of iron(III) chloride carried out in diluted dichloromethane ( DCM ) solution yielded a dark purple benzodithiophene-4,5-diketone ( 2 ) crystal. Acetylation of 2 with Zn powder and acetic anhydride performed under basic conditions produced yellowish benzodithiophene-4,5-diyl diacetate ( 3 ) powder in a good yield of 85% . 3 was then alkylated with 2ethylhexyl bromide in the presence of Cs 2 CO 3 yielding 4,5bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzodithiophene ( 4 ) as a sticky colorless liquid. Proton abstraction of 4 by n-BuLi followed by the reaction with tri-butyltin chloride gave the polycondensation precursor , 4,5-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,7-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)benzodithiophene ( 5 ). To preserve high reactivity , the crude product was subjected to flash chromatography and kept under -20 °C for the condensation reaction. Alkylation of the thiophene ring was carried out by Kumada coupling , yielding 3-alkylthiophene as a colorless oil or a white solid ( 6-9 ). Lithiation of alkylated thiophene followed by quenching with tri-butyltin chloride afforded tri-butyl(4alkylthiophene-2-yl)stannane ( 10-13 ). Subsequent coupling with 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole afforded dithienyl-substituted difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole , 14-17. NBS bromination of 14-17 produced the acceptor units , 18-21 , respectively , which were carefully purified through chromatography and recrystallization to ensure high reactivity for the condensation reaction. The Stille polycondensation reaction of donor unit 5 and acceptor units 18-21 was carried out under the catalyst of Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 in chlorobenzene solutions at 150 °C for 3 days that could afford the corresponding polymers as a dark green solid. Gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) was used to determine the molecular weight using polystyrene as the standard and 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene as the eluent ( Table 1 ).",

    "sentence": "The decomposition temperature ( T d ) of PffBB-n was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA ).

Article fabrication. The physical properties of PffBB-n polymers are summarized in Table 1. Detailed synthetic procedures and TGA traces could be found in the Supporting Information ( SI ). Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Polymers. The UV - vis absorption spectra of PffBB-n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , or 16 ) measured in chlorobenzene at different temperatures and in thin films are shown in Figure 1. It is clearly demonstrated that PffBB-n exhibits strong temperature - dependent aggregation behavior. In thin films , PffBB-n showed three major absorption bands with the high - energy absorption peaked at ∼ 430 nm and two overlapped and strong absorptions peaked at ∼ 620 and 680 nm. In solution , the first two absorption peaks blue - shift to 380-420 and 520-560 nm , respectively , and the third absorption is highly temperature - dependent which becomes a shoulder peak at high temperature. Therefore , the absorption band located in the high energy region was attributed to π-π* transitions , whereas the broad absorption at around 560 nm corresponded to the intramolecular charge transfer band and the long - wavelength absorption emerged at ∼ 680 nm was due to the polymer interchain stacking aggregation. This aggregation - induced absorption is temperature - sensitive in which the absorption decreases with the increase of temperature , resulting from polymer chain segregation at high temperature. The incorporation of an alkyl side chain can often render a better solubility of a polymer ; however , the long alkyl side chain can exert stronger alkyl-alkyl chain interactions that can give rise to a strong aggregation of polymer chains. As shown in Figure 1 , the aggregation ability / strength of PffBB-n polymers also enhanced with an increase in the size of the alkyl side chains ( from n = 10 to 16 ). Furthermore , this class of polymers exhibited solvent - dependent aggregation behavior in which chloroform and toluene often induced stronger aggregation ; on the other hand , chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene induced moderate aggregation ( Figure S3 ).",

    "sentence": "In the solid state , the planarity effect and interchain stacking of PffBB-n caused the bathochromic shift of the absorption cut - off to ∼ 780 nm , corresponding to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.61 eV. Density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations was carried out to probe the molecular and electronic properties of the PffBB-n polymer by means of B3LYP / 6-311+(d,p) as a basis set in a vacuum using the repeating conjugated units of the polymer backbone in which all of the alkyl substitutions were replaced by ethyl groups to reduce the calculation time. Figure 2 displays the optimized molecular conformation and the frontier molecular orbitals of the ethyl-substituted repeating units of PffBB-n. The dihedral angle between the BDT electron - donating unit and the electron - deficient unit was found to be ∼ 26.9 ° in the optimized structure , which is caused by the ethyl substitution on the thienyl ring. The HOMO delocalizes extensively over the π-conjugation framework , whereas the LUMO mainly populated on the benzothiadiazole Article unit. Such frontier molecular orbital electron distribution would greatly enhance efficient intramolecular charge transfer. The electrochemical properties of PffBB-n were determined by cyclic voltammetry. Their results are summarized in Table 2 , and the respective energy levels are delineated in Figure 2d. The HOMO energy levels of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 were estimated from the onset oxidation potential to be -5.66 , -5.73 , -5.72 , and -5.78 eV , respectively. The corresponding LUMO energy levels were calculated from the HOMO energy level and the onset absorption of polymers in thin films , which were -4.01 , -4.11 , -4.11 , and -4.16 eV , respectively. As a result , the HOMO energy levels of PffBB-n polymers are much lower than that of ITO and their corresponding LUMO energy levels of PffBB-n lied slightly above that of PC71BM. Such energy level alignment would facilitate charge transfer from the donor polymer to the PC71BM acceptor and provide a relatively large difference between the HOMO energy level of donor polymers and the LUMO level of PC71BM , which is important to achieve a large V oc of a solar device. As a result , BHJ PSCs fabricated from these polymers are promising to achieve high device performance. X-Ray Diffraction ( XRD ). X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out to determine the crystallinity of PffBB-n polymers and the XRD spectra are shown in Figure 3. Despite various sizes of alkyl side chains attached , polymers with the same backbone show very similar XRD patterns. The sharp peaks at around 5 ° correspond to the in-plane spacing ( d 1spacing ) between the polymer backbones , whereas the broad peaks lying above 20 ° ( d 2 -spacing ) is characterized as a π-π stacking distance.",

The active blend layer was prepared by means of spin - coating at different temperatures to investigate the impact of coating temperature on photovoltaic device performance , which was characterized under AM 1.5 G simulated solar illumination at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm^-2 . To achieve the high coating temperatures , the high boiling chlorobenzene ( 132 °C ) was used as a solvent even though chloroform is a stronger aggregation - induced solvent. Detailed device fabrication procedures can be found in the electrospray ionisation. The current density - voltage curves of BHJ PSCs fabricated at 60 , 80 , and 100 °C using a 3% CN as the solvent additive and their respective photovoltaic properties are shown in Figure 4 and summarized in Table 3 , respectively. It is important to note that the photovoltaic device performance is greatly affected by the active blend coating temperature. The decyl-substituted PffBB-10 - based device showed a good PCE of 8.22% with a high V oc of 0.93 V , a J sc of 14.62 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 60.44% when the active layer was coated at 80 ° C. On the other hand , PffBB-10 - based devices fabricated at 60 and 100 °C spin - coating temperatures exhibited inferior photovoltaic performance with a lower J sc and a much lower FF of ∼ 56% except for a similar V oc . Furthermore , BHJ PSCs based on PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 also exhibited the same trend in which their highest PCE was achieved by spin - coating the active blend layer at 80 °C .",

    "sentence": "Such a superior device performance is the result of the highest J sc and FF achieved ( Table 3 ) when using 80 °C as a spin - coating temperature compared to those fabricated at 60 or 100 ° C. The decrease in both the J sc and FF could be due to inferior polymer chain packing in the active layer leading to a poor charge transporting network. Besides , the device performance generally varied with the length of alkyl side chains attached onto the polymer backbone. The device efficiency initially increases upon the incorporation of longer alkyl side chains from decyl to tetradecyl reaching a maximum at tetradecyl-substituted PffBB-14 and then declines with further alkyl side chain extension. Importantly , such chain Article length - dependent device performance trend is spin - coating temperature independent. The champion PffBB-14 - based device affords the highest PCE of 9.93% with a V oc of 0.92 V , a J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36% . The size of the alkyl side chain is known to affect the processability and interchain interactions of a polymer , which would provide a tool to optimize the π-π stacking interactions of a polymer in the solid state. A size - optimized alkyl side chain would provide a good balance between the π-π stacking interactions of the polymer backbone and the alkyl-alkyl side chain interactions resulting in a highly ordered molecular packing for efficient charge transport. Figure 5a shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra of PffBB-n / PC71BM - based PSCs. Strong and broad photo - to - current responses were observed in the range from 330 to 780 nm in all of these PSCs , in which the absorption above 650 nm was attributed to the polymer aggregationinduced absorption broadening. Remarkably , the PffBB-14based device exhibited a much higher photoconversion Article response ranging from 350 to 500 nm than those of other devices , thus affording the highest J sc among all of these devices. As PffBB-n polymers showed similar absorption properties , the high current density of PffBB-14 - based PSC would result from well - ordered polymer : PC71BMnetwork / packing. J sc derived from the EQE spectra were estimated to be 14.12 , 14.92 , 16.29 , and 14.21 mA cm^-2 for PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based devices , respectively , which were in good agreement with those obtained from J-V characterization ( Figure 6 ). Charge Transfer and Recombination. The charge carrier mobilities of PffBB-n - based devices were estimated on hole - only and electron - only devices using the space - chargelimited current ( SCLC ) model , and the results are summarized in Table 4. Indeed , the highest and well - balanced charge carrier mobility of the PffBB-14:PC71BM blend affords a higher J sc and FF than those of other devices. Charge dissociation probability was characterized by photogenerated current density ( J ph ) vs effective applied voltage ( V eff ) measurements.",

    "sentence": "Based on the definition , J ph equals to the difference between the current density of devices under 100 mW cm^-2 ( J L ) and that in the dark ( J D ). V eff = V 0 - V , where V 0 is the voltage at which J L = J D and V is the applied voltage. When the reverse voltage is greater than 2 V , recombination will be suppressed because of a high internal electric field and thus the current density becomes saturated ( J sat ). Consequently , P(E,T) = J ph / J sat could be used to describe the charge dissociation probability. The charge dissociation probability of PffBB-10 , PffBB-12 , PffBB-14 , and PffBB-16 - based cells was estimated to be 0.86 , 0.94 , 0.98 , and 0.92 , respectively. The highest exciton dissociation of the PffBB-14 - based device is anticipated to give rise to the best photovoltaic performance among these series of polymers. Figure 7 demonstrates the dependence of V oc and J sc against light intensity , which could be used to describe the recombination process in BHJ films. The V oc is directly proportional to the incident light intensity in the semilogarithmic plot with a slope of kT / q , which describes bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film , where k represents the Boltzmann constant , T is the Kelvin temperature , and q is the elementary charge. Trap - assisted recombination exists if the slope is larger than kT / q. 42 Among devices fabricated , the PffBB-14 - based cell exhibited the smallest slope of 1.10 kT / q , suggesting the least trap - assisted recombination. Bimolecular recombination was also investigated by measuring the dependence of J sc against light intensity , in which the exponential factor α in the power law of J sc ∝ P light α is used Article to indicate bimolecular recombination in the BHJ film. The closer the estimated α to 1.0 , the weaker the bimolecular recombination occurs in the device. 43 Obviously , with α = 0.98 , the PffBB-14 - based device would exhibit the least occurrence of bimolecular recombination in the active layer. In contrast , the PffBB-10 - based device showed an α value of 0.86 , indicating that the bimolecular recombination loss was severe in its BHJ film. These results consistently indicate that the PffBB-14:PC71BM blend with superior balanced charge carrier transport exhibits the least recombination loss among PffBBn : PC71BM - based PSCs , thus affording the highest J sc and FF. Morphology of the Active Layer. AFM images of PffBBn : PC71BM blended thin films were obtained to investigate their microphase separation behavior and the corresponding AFM height and phase images recorded in the tapping mode are shown in Figure 8. Good miscibility could be observed in all of the PffBB-n:PC71BM blended thin films , which gives rise to desirable phase separation.",

    "sentence": "The resulting root-mean-square ( rms ) roughness of active layer films was estimated to be 2.6 , 1.8 , 1.0 , and 2.2 nm for PffBB-10:PC71BM , PffBB-10:PC71BM , PffBB-12:PC71BM , PffBB-14:PC71BM , and PffBB-16:PC71BM blend , respectively. Smaller domain sizes in the active blend layer could afford a short exciton diffusion length , which is desirable to suppress the recombination loss. 44 The active layer morphologies recorded are in good accordance with the J sc performance of the PffBBn : PC71BM - based devices. Consistent with the observed homogeneous donor : acceptor network with the smallest rms roughness , the PffBB-14 - based device exhibited the highest J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 and FF of 64.36% , suggesting efficient charge dissociation and transport. In short , AFM results confirm that the PffBB-14:PC71BM blend layer exhibited a desirable morphology for efficient photovoltaic properties. Our results also indicated that the extremely strong aggregation strength of the donor polymer would hinder for the formation of a desirable homogeneous donor / acceptor interpenetration network for efficient photovoltaic performance . We have developed a new series of donor - acceptor copolymer derived from 4,5-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and dialkyl-substituted difluorinated 4,7-di-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole units , such as PffBB-n ( n = 10 , 12 , 14 , and 16 ) as a low band gap donor material for the application of highly efficient BHJ PSCs. PffBB-n exhibited intriguing strong and controllable aggrega - tion behavior , which can be modulated by the size of the alkyl side chain attached on the polymer backbone , processing temperature and solvent used. Because of the strong aggregation behavior , the absorption cut - off of the polymer thin films could extend to ∼ 780 nm , giving rise to a narrow optical band gap of ∼ 1.6 eV. Taking advantage of the temperature - dependent aggregation effect , BHJ PSCs with PffBB-n:PC71BM as an active blend layer spin - coated at different temperatures were fabricated and investigated which showed considerably various photovoltaic performance. Among PSCs fabricated , the PffBB-14:PC71BM - based device with an active blend layer spin - coated at 80 °C , showed the best photovoltaic performance with the highest PCE of 9.93% , a large V oc of 0.92 V , a highest J sc of 16.77 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 64.36% . Such an excellent device performance was attributed to the strong and aggregation - broadened absorption , superior exciton dissociation , desirable film morphology , better balanced charge carrier mobilities , and minimal recombination loss. Our results demonstrated that the side chain length modification and processing temperature modulation were proved to be useful for tuning polymer interchain interactions , absorption properties , active layer morphology , and charge carrier properties , thus optimizing the ultimate device performance of BHJ PSCs.

    "sentence": "Three kinds of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) type semiconducting copolymers in which electron donating units of dithienopyrrole ( DTP ) and accepting units of benzothiadiazole ( BT ) were connected with different numbers of thienyl spacers ( x = 0-2 ) were synthesized and used as electron donor materials in polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) combined with fullerene derivatives. The optical band gaps of the polymers could be tuned from 1.41 eV to 1.61 eV by changing the number of thiophene spacers. Electrochemical measurements showed that the increase of band gap is mainly due to the change of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level. The power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymer solar cells based on the three polymers and PC 70 BM reached 3.12% with x = 2 under the illumination of AM 1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 . This approach could provide a simple strategy for designing high - performance D-A type photovoltaic polymers based on the existing polymers and a large potential to improve their performance further. † Electronic supplementary information ( ESI ) available : XRD patterns , DFT and TD - DFT calculations. See Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted much interest due to their great potential to be a renewable energy technology based on simple and low cost manufacture. [1][2][3] The concept of a bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) utilizing mixtures of a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative is regarded as an efficient system for photovoltaic application. 4 The most representative active layers of the blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) with fullerene derivatives were extensively investigated. [5][6][7] While the advantage of P3HT is its simple structure with a relatively high hole mobility , the weak point of P3HT as the photovoltaic donor material towards efficient PSCs is the mismatch of its absorption spectrum ( absorption edge is about 650 nm ) with the terrestrial solar spectrum. The band gap of P3HT ( 1.9 eV ) is larger than the optimum band gap range ( 1.3 - 1.5 eV ) for polymer - fullerene BHJ solar cells. 8 Hence , design of photovoltaic polymers with broader absorption toward longer wavelengths , especially in the near - infrared ( NIR ) range , is necessary for high efficiency conjugated polymer donor materials. Thanks to the many attempts that have been made to develop NIR absorbing polymers , a notable improvement of the overall power - conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been achieved. [9][10][11] One of the most powerful and flexible strategies to design low band gap conjugated polymers involves an alternating sequence of electron - donor ( D ) and electron - acceptor ( A ) moieties along the conjugated polymer main chain.",

    "sentence": "12,13 The highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of this so - called donor - acceptor ( D-A ) type copolymers are mainly localized on the donor and acceptor units , respectively , thus the band gap can be well tuned by the choice of D and A. Such a D-A strategy is now widely used as one of the most promising approaches to design efficient polymers for application to the polymer photovoltaic. Thiophene is a simple and fundamental block to construct new D-A type copolymers. Recently , the bridged dithiophene has attracted considerable attention as a donor unit because of its ability to fix the dithiophene system into a planar structure , which is much more efficient than the dithiophene in constructing highly - conjugated copolymers. Four bridging dithiophene units with the atoms of carbon ( C ) , silicon ( Si ) , germanium ( Ge ) and nitrogen ( N ) afford cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene ( CPDT ) , dithienosilole ( DTS ) , dithienogermole ( DTG ) and dithieno [ 3,2- b : 2′,3′-d]pyrrole ( DTP ) , respectively. CPDT was first introduced into the low band gap polymers , and the corresponding copolymer alternating CPDT with benzothiadiazole showed a PCE of 5.5% , after using a small amount of alkanedithiols to control the morphology of the blend film. 14,15 Later on , large amounts of CPDT - based photovoltaic polymers were designed and synthesized. [16][17][18][19][20] In comparison with the C-C bond , a longer C-Si bond shows less steric hindrance , which directly resulted in better π-π stacking along the conjugated polymer backbones. 21,22 Polymers based on DTS normally have high hole mobility and strong light absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum and hence the improvement in photovoltaic performance , which reached 5.1% . 12 DTG shows lower intermolecular steric hindrance than DTS because of the longer C-Ge bond compared to the C-Si , resulting in the corresponding DTG - containing solar cells exhibiting higher short - current and fill factor. [23][24][25] Planar dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole ( DTP ) , with good π-conjugation , showed great potential for use in organic electronic materials. 26 D-A type photovoltaic polymers with DTP as the electron - donating unit , exhibiting low band gap and enhanced solubility , have been intensively applied to PSCs. 27,28 In our previous study , PSCs based on DTP - containing copolymers and PC 70 BM showed a short - circuit current as high as 22.6 mA cm^-1 , 29 indicating that DTP - containing copolymers could be promising building blocks for superior photovoltaic performance. On the other hand , benzothiadiazole ( BT ) containing the electron - withdrawing imine ( -CvN- ) nitrogen has been widely used as a strong acceptor in D-A copolymers. 30,31 Numerous attempts to develop novel D-A copolymers have shown that 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( DTBT ) is an effective acceptor unit , and photovoltaic devices made from blends with fullerene derivatives show PCE up to 5.4% .",

    "sentence": "14,[32][33][34][35][36] In 2008 , we reported the synthesis of a copolymer between the DTP donor and the DTBT acceptor. 27 It has been proved that the thienyl ring can enhance the π-π stacking intermolecular interactions and lead to a high charge carrier mobility. 37 In addition , the ordered structure can enhance the carrier mobility ; thereby symmetric thienyl units along the polymer main chain are selected. In this regard , a simple and effective method might be to tune the properties of D-A type photovoltaic polymers by introducing thienyl groups as spacers between donor and acceptor segments in the backbone. In this study , three kinds of low band gap copolymers integrating DTP as the donor block and the most - used BT as the acceptor unit were synthesized. Different numbers of thienyl ( T ) as spacers were introduced along the copolymer main chain to investigate the effect on optical , electrochemical and photovoltaic performance. [6,6]-Phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) was used as an acceptor in the blended film of copolymers : PC 70 BM. Different solvents ( chlorobenzene ( CB ) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) ) were tested to build an optimized interpenetrated network in the active film , and the corresponding film properties and the photovoltaic device performance are discussed in detail . Fig. 1 shows the optical absorption spectra of PDTP-BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT in CHCl 3 solution and in thin films spin - coated on quartz plates. The absorption maximum wavelength in the solutions and the films and the optical band gap deduced from the absorption onsets are summarized in Table 1. Judging from the splitting of the absorption bands , it can be speculated that the polymers have the typical absorption characteristics of D-A type copolymers with π-π* and charge transfer - type transitions. Comparing the polymers PDTP-BT and PDTP-DT2BT with the previously synthesized polymer PDTP - DTBT , 27 the difference in their absorption is distinct. The PDTP - DTBT solution showed two prominent absorption maxima at 450 and 671 nm , while PDTP-BT and PDTP-DT2BT solutions demonstrated two main absorption maxima at 413 and 711 nm and at 480 and 603 nm , respectively. Although the absorption peaks in the Scheme 1 Synthetic route of three dithienopyrrole - based donor - acceptor type copolymers with thienyl spacers. long wavelength blue - shifted by 40 nm and 108 nm with insertion of one and two thienyl spacers to PDTP-BT , the absorption coefficients at the absorption maxima increase from 3.6 × 10^4 ( PDTP-BT ) to 4.0 × 10^4 ( PDTP - DTBT ) and 4.7 × 10^4 L mol^-1 cm^-1 ( PDTP-DT2BT ) , respectively. In thin films , the three copolymers exhibit similar shapes and red - shifted absorption spectra compared with those in the solutions , which indicates stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid state.",

    "sentence": "38 In addition , the PDTP-BT film shows a large shoulder peak at 800 nm , while no shoulder peaks were observed for PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT , indicating stronger intermolecular interaction in PDTP-BT than in the others. These results suggest that on the absorption of the polymers , both absorption peaks and absorption coefficients could be readily controlled by tailoring the number of thienyl spacers along the polymers. 37,39,40 The absorption edge shifts from ca. 900 nm in PDTP-BT to ca. 850 nm in PDTP - DTBT and ca. 750 nm in PDTP-DT2BT , reflecting the broadening of the optical band - gap in sequence. Table 1 shows the optical band - gaps ( E opt g ) of all polymers estimated from the corresponding UV - vis absorption onset. PDTP-DT2BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-BT have optical band gaps of 1.61 , 1.46 and 1.41 eV , respectively , which are close to the ideal value of 1.5 eV for PSC application. These changes of the absorption spectra upon the introduction of thienyl groups can be qualitatively understood from density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations of the corresponding model compounds ( Fig. S1 † ). The optimized structures show that all the polymer backbones are mostly planar. Time dependent DFT calculations show that the absorption band in the longer wavelength is mainly attributed to the transition from HOMO delocalized in the D-A backbone to LUMO localized in DTP units for all the polymers. On the other hand , the absorption in the shorter wavelength is largely contributed by the transition from HOMO to LUMO+1 , which is similar to π-π* transition in polythiophene judging by the shape of the orbitals. Therefore , the introduction of more thienyl spacer could stabilize LUMO+1 ( π* ) due to the better conjugation , resulting in the red - shift of the absorption band. At the same time , it could decrease the D-A nature of the polymer due to the weaker electron acceptability of DTP , resulting in the blueshift of the charge transfer bands . Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the polymers and estimate the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers. Representative cyclic voltammogram ( CV ) curves of these copolymers are shown in Fig. 2 Crystalline order of the copolymer thin films was investigated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) scans ( Fig. S2 † ). In the out - of - plane measurement , the XRD pattern of PDTP-BT reveals a weak peak near 6 ° , and there is no clear peak for PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT , suggesting that they exhibit amorphous structures in the film , which might be due to the bulky side chain in the DTP building block. A change in the number of thienyl spacers in this system does not significantly affect the aggregation behaviour of the polymer main chains.",

    "sentence": "The microstructure of blend films of the copolymers with fullerene derivatives is known to have a large effect on the charge transport properties and the corresponding efficiencies of PSCs. Here , the atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was applied to investigate the morphology of the blend film of the polymer : PC 70 BM fabricated from CB and DCB solutions , respectively , as shown in Fig. 3. For PDTP-BT : PC 70 BM , both CB and DCB gave the films with obvious phase separation with a root mean square ( RMS ) of 2.222 nm and 0.880 nm , respectively , which might be due to the poor miscibility of the two materials. For PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT , the blend film of polymer / PC 70 BM spin - coated from CB was also rough , but the blend films fabricated from DCB displayed a much smoother surface with a RMS of 0.188 nm and 0.259 nm , respectively. This smaller roughness of the blend film indicates that the domain size of the phase separation of the donor - acceptor interpenetrating network could be reduced , which could be beneficial for the exciton charge separation and charge transport. These results indicate that the morphologies of these polymers with PC 70 BM are quite sensitive to the solvents used for device processing and the introduction of a thienyl spacer could improve the miscibility . The photovoltaic properties of the three copolymers PDTP-BT , PDTP - DTBT and PDTP-DT2BT were studied by fabricating bulk heterojunction BHJ - type PSCs with a conventional sandwich configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC 70 BM / Ca / Al. The effective areas of the PSCs , contributing to photocurrent , were defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light. The devices were optimized by changing many factors , such as the ratio of the donor and the acceptor , the thickness of blend films and the cathode metal. The best performance was obtained with the thickness of the active layer of 80-90 nm , the copolymers : PC 70 BM ratio of 1 : 2 ( by weight ) and the Ca / Al used as the cathode. Fig. 4 shows the J-V curves of the optimized PSCs based on the three polymers under illumination of AM 1.5 simulated solar light ( 100 mW cm^-2 ).

    "sentence": "The DCB solvent induced high performance photovoltaic devices due to the optimized interpenetrated network of the active film. The best devices of PDTP-BT and PDTP - DTBT show PCE of 1.64% and 2.37% , respectively. The polymer PDTP-DT2BT exhibits the highest PCE of 3.12% , ascribed to the largest J SC = 11.43 mA cm^-2 with a slightly lower V OC of 0.54 V and a slightly higher FF of 0.57 than the other polymers. The V OC values of the devices are around 0.5 V , suggesting that the addition of the thienyl units does not affect the main chain distortion. This coincides well with similar HOMO energy levels for the copolymers measured by CV. These results indicate that the PCEs of the photovoltaic devices based on PDTP-DT2BT : PC 70 BM were higher than those of PDTP - DTBT : PC 70 BM and PDTP-BT : PC 70 BM. Overall , it is an effective approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - based copolymers by increasing the number of unsubstituted thienyl units along the copolymers backbone. Fig. 5 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) plots of the devices based on three copolymer : PC 70 BM combinations under the illumination of monochromatic light. With the increase of thienyl spacers , the EQE response wavelengths show a blue shift , a similar tendency to the absorption spectra , but the EQE peak values were higher in PDTP-DT2BT ( 58% ) compared to PDTP-BT ( 23% ) or PDTP - DTBT ( 42% ). The shapes of the EQE curves of the devices in the range of 450-700 nm could be assigned to the stronger absorption of PC 70 BM . In conclusion , three low band gap D-A copolymers , based on the DTP donor and the BT acceptor , with different numbers of thienyl spacers along the backbone have been designed and synthesized. The thienyl spacer makes the absorption spectra peak blue - shift in the longer wavelength range and red - shift in the low wavelength range. Under 1.5 G^100 mW cm^-2 illumination , a best PCE of 3.12% for PDTP-DT2BT was recorded , with V OC = 0.48 V , J SC = 11.43 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.57. Although the best PCE is still not high enough for commercial use , our optimization by designing suitable molecular structures , selecting different solvents and changing other factors could provide useful information for further studies of the commercialized PSCs .",

    "sentence": "We report the synthesis , characterization , and solar cell properties of new donor - acceptor - type low band gap polymers ( POBDTPD and PEBDTPD ) that incorporate dialkoxybenzodithiophene ( BDT ) as the donor and N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5-azacyclopenta[a]pentalene-4,6-dione ( DTPD ) as the acceptor. The newly developed DTPD moiety was carefully designed to lower a band gap via strong interaction between donor - acceptor moieties and keep polymer energy levels deep. Remarkably , the DTPD acceptor moiety effectively widens the light absorption range of the polymers up to ∼ 900 nm while positioning their HOMO and LUMO levels in the optimal range , i.e. , -5.3 and -4.0 eV , respectively , for high power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as we intended. Solar cell devices were fabricated according to the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / photoactive ( polymer : PC 70 BM ) / TiO 2 / Al. The POBDTPD devices exhibited a PCE of 4.7% with a V oc of 0.70 V , a J sc of 10.6 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.64. The PEBDTPD devices yielded a higher PCE of 5.3% with a V oc of 0.72 V , a J sc of 13.5 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.54. AFM , TEM , and PL quenching measurements revealed that the high J sc s are a result of the appropriate morphology and efficient charge separation. In comparing the performances of the two polymer devices , the higher J sc for the PEBDTPD device was attributed to its better nanoscale phase separation , smoother surface , and higher carrier mobility in the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films. The higher FF for the POBDTPD device was ascribed to a good balance between the hole and electron mobilities. Overall , we demonstrate that the DTPD unit is a promising electron - accepting moiety to develop high performance low band gap polymers . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted great attention for their potential utility in the production of large - area , low - cost , and flexible photovoltaic devices via solution processing. 1-4 To achieve high power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) , electrondonor polymers should have the following desirable characteristics : ( i ) good absorption spectral overlap with the solar spectrum , ( ii ) optimal energy level alignment with respect to electron - acceptor fullerene derivatives ( typically [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 60 BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71butyric acid methyl ester ( PC 70 BM ) ) to facilitate efficient exciton separation , ( iii ) formation of a nanoscale interpenetrating network of the polymer and fullerene domains inside the photoactive layer , and ( iv ) provision of effective charge transport carriers toward the electrodes. To meet these requirements , intensive research efforts have been focused on integrating electron - rich donor units and electron - deficient acceptor units into a single conjugated polymeric system.",

However , good acceptor moieties enabling polymers to absorb wavelengths over 800 nm remain still rare though acceptor moieties strongly affected to produce a narrow band gap. 37-40 In search of new acceptor moieties , we designed an interesting structure of N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5-azacyclopenta[a]-pentalene-4,6-dione ( DTPD ). The DTPD is a structural combination of thieno [3,4-b]thiophene and N-alkylpyrrole-2,5-dione. The thieno [3,4-b]thiophene is a particularly suitable structure to promote quinoid structures in conjugated polymers. 41-44 However , simple incorporation of the thieno- [3,4-b]thiophene units might increase the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) level of polymers , which causes a significant loss of open - circuit voltages in PSCs. 42 Thus , it is desirable to attach electron - withdrawing groups such as ketone or ester groups and fluorine atoms. 12,15,30 Here we glued the Nalkylpyrrole-2,5-dione , a strong electron - withdrawing unit , 45 to the thieno [3,4-b]thiophene to bring down the HOMO level. Our DFT calculations , indeed , suggested that the DTPD would be a strong electron - withdrawing acceptor moiety ( Figure S1 ). 26,45 Therefore , each fractional unit in the DTPD may exert a synergetic effect to permit strong donor - acceptor electronic delocalization by the quinoid structure and to locate HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) levels of resulting low band gap polymers in a deep state when the DTPD is copolymerized with an appropriate donor moiety. Despite these promising features , to the best of our knowledge , the DTPD moiety has never been utilized to synthesize low band gap polymers for PSCs. Herein , we report synthesis and characterization of two polymers , POBDTPD and PEBDTPD , that consist of DTPD and BDT moieties substituted with octyloxy or 2-ethylhexyloxy g r o u p s , r e s p e c t i v e l y .

This work demonstrates that the newly designed DTPD moiety is a promising building block for high performance PSCs . The thermal properties of the polymers were examined by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ).

    "sentence": "Both polymers showed good thermal stabilities. In the TGA measurement , the decomposition temperatures ( T d ) at which a 5% weight loss occurred were as high as 339 and 337 °C for POBDTPD and PEBDTPD , respectively ( Figure S2c,d ). 3.3. Optical Properties and Electronic Structures. The UV - vis absorption spectra of POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers in a chlorobenzene solution or in a thin film state are shown in Figure 1a. The absorption peaks and optical band gaps are summarized in Table 1. POBDTPD and PEBDTPD in solution showed similar characteristics , covering a wide range absorption band of 300-900 nm. A strong absorption was observed at short wavelengths with a maximum peak at ∼ 490 nm ; a broad absorption peak was observed over the longer wavelength range of 550-900 nm. The lower absorption of POBDTPD in 550-900 nm is presumably related with the higher fraction of lower molecular weighted POBDTPD polymer chains compared to the PEBDTPD. 46 POBDTPD and PEBDTPD films also showed similar absorption bandwidth and shape. However , there was a pronounced difference that the PEBDTPD film showed a higher extinction coefficient ( 4.1 × 10^4 cm^-1 at the peak of 675 nm ) than the POBDTPD ( 2.6 × 10^4 cm^-1 at the peak of 673 nm ) , reflecting that the polymer chain packing in PEBDTPD film is better than that in POBDTPD. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements were carried out to determine the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers. The cyclic voltammograms of the polymers and energy level diagram for the materials used in the study are shown in Figures 2 and 1b , respectively. The oxidation and reduction potentials and the electrochemical band gaps ( E g EC ) of the polymers are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO levels of the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers were -5.23 and -5.37 eV , respectively. Interestingly , the branched alkyl chains of 2ethylhexyloxy groups stabilized the HOMO level slightly more than the linear alkyl chains of octyloxy groups , which is in line with previous reports. 47-50 The LUMO levels of POBDTPD and PEBDTPD were -4.00 and -4.06 eV , respectively. This less dependence of the polymer LUMO level on substituted alkyl chains is again consistent with the previous report. 47 This different dependence of the HOMO or LUMO levels on the substituted alkyl chains might be originated from the fact that the alkoxy chains affect the position of the HOMO level than the LUMO level since they participate to some degree in the construction of HOMO but does little in the formation of LUMO according to our DFT calculation ( Figure 3 ). It should be noted that the LUMO levels are on the borderline for fast electron transfer to PC 70 BM whose LUMO level is -4.3 eV. 51 This result indicated that the DTPD acted as a very strong electron - withdrawing unit in donor - acceptor - type low band gap polymers , as predicted in the DFT calculation.",

Photovoltaic Performance Measurements. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using polymer : PC 70 BM blend films. The polymer : PC 70 BM blends were dissolved in a mixed solvent containing chlorobenzene ( CB ) and 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) in a volume ratio of 97 : 3. The solutions were spincoated onto PEDOT : PSS - coated ITO substrates. A thin TiO 2 nanoparticle layer was then spin - coated onto the blend film , followed by aluminum evaporation. Devices prepared using either polymer showed the best performances for a polymer : PC 70 BM blend ratio of 1 : 2. The solar cell properties were measured under AM1.5G illumination , and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The current density - voltage curves are shown in Figure 4a. POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices displayed reasonable open - circuit voltages ( V oc ) of 0.70 and 0.72 V , respectively , considering their HOMO levels , -5.23 and -5.37 eV , respectively. The POBDTPD device exhibited a short - circuit current ( J sc ) of 10.6 mA cm^-2 , whereas the PEBDTPD device showed a J sc of 13.5 mA cm^-2 . The fill factor ( FF ) values were 0.64 and 0.54 for the POBDTPD and the PEBDTPD devices , respectively. As a result , the PCEs were 4.7% and 5.3% for the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD devices , respectively. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) spectra were also measured ( Figure 4b ). A high EQE response of greater than 50% over the range 400- 550 nm was observed for both polymer devices. The EQEs were higher for the PEBDTPD device in the 550-900 nm range , partly because the PEBDTPD polymer has a higher light absorption at long wavelengths ( Figure 1a ) , which is consistent with the higher J sc values in the PEBDTPD device. To understand the reasons of the higher J sc and the lower FF in the PEBDTPD device , as compared with the POBDTPD device more specifically , we investigated film morphology , exciton separation , and carrier mobility in the polymer films and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films. First , film morphology was Figure 6 shows the PL spectra of the polymers and polymer : PC 70 BM blend films spin - coated from CB solutions or CB solutions containing 3 vol % DIO additives. Both the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers displayed PL with a peak around 990 nm. Blending polymers with PC 70 BMs , especially with an aid of the DIO additive , significantly quenched PL. This effective PL quenching suggested that the exciton separation was highly efficient in both the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films.",

    "sentence": "The more effective quenching in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend than in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend implies two possibilities : ( i ) better exciton separation in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend films and ( ii ) a larger contact area between the polymer and the PC 70 BM through more optimal nanoscale phase separation. The former could be ruled out because the PEBDTPD polymer had a slightly higher LUMO level as the POBDTPD polymer. The latter was thus mainly responsible for the effective PL quenching , as confirmed from the film morphology studies. That is , the miscibility between polymers and PC 70 BM is an important factor for efficient exciton separation. Conclusively , morphology and PL quenching studies revealed that the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film has more favorable features for the higher J sc . Carrier mobilities were measured to estimate the ability of hole and electron transport and the carrier mobility balance. The hole mobilities of the polymers or the polymer : PC 70 BM blends were measured via the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method using hole - only devices ( ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer or polymer : PC 70 BM / Au ). The JL 3 -V characteristics of the polymers and the polymer : PC 70 BM blend films are shown in Figure 7. For all films , a slope of 2 in the log JL 3 - log V plot was observed , which is a signature of SCLC transport. The hole mobilities of the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers were estimated to be 1.5 × 10^-4 and 1.3 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. Although these hole mobilities of homopolymers were nearly identical , the hole mobility in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film decreased only slightly to 1.2 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , whereas that in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film decreased significantly to 3.5 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . The considerable mobility decrease in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film may result from the less uniform , more aggregated morphology as aforementioned. In addition , the electron mobilities of the polymer : PC 70 BM blends were measured using electron - only devices ( Al / polymer : PC 70 BM / Al ). The electron mobilities were 8.8 × 10^-6 and 1.1 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 in the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM and PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blends , respectively. The hole and electron mobilities of the polymers and polymer : PC 70 BM blends are summarized in Table 3. From this carrier mobility measurement , we concluded that the higher hole mobility of the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blends contributed to the higher J sc values as well. Moreover , the lower FF for the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend can be explained in terms of the balance between hole and electron transport.",

    "sentence": "The ratios between the hole and electron mobilities were calculated to be 3.2 and 13.6 for the POBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend and the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend films , respectively. The less balanced carrier transport in the PEBDTPD : PC 70 BM blend film accounts for the lower FF. The polymers and polymer blend films were also analyzed by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) studies. Figure 8 shows the XRD patterns of the polymers and the polymer : PC 70 BM blends. All film XRD results were similar and showed weak crystalline features with a broad peak around 23 ° . The crystalline features corresponding to π-stacking among the conjugated polymer backbones were also observed among TT - based polymers ; 25 however , the peaks were broader , and no crystalline peaks were observed at smaller angles around 4.4 ° . This less crystalline feature was possibly caused by the more twisted polymer backbones , as compared to PTB7 or PBDTTPD polymer backbones . In conclusion , we synthesized the low band gap POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers that consist of dialkoxybenzodithiophene ( BDT ) as the donor and N-octyl-2,7-dithia-5azacyclopenta[a]pentalene-4,6-dione ( DTPD ) as the acceptor. The DTPD acceptor moieties allow the POBDTPD and PEBDTPD polymers to have a low band gap ( ∼ 900 nm ) and optimal HOMO and LUMO levels alignment for PSCs , yielding the PCEs of 4.7 and 5.3% , respectively. In this study , we demonstrate , for the first time , that the DTPD unit is a promising electron - withdrawing building block for low band gap polymers , and it can be utilized to tailor the optical and electronic properties of conjugated polymers for photovoltaic devices and many other applications in plastic electronics.",

The intrinsic properties of PCDSeBT are not only characterized by UV - vis absorption , cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) , and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) but also the surface morphology , mobilities of space charge - limited current ( SCLC ) model , and polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) in its bulkheterojunction ( BHJ ) active layer with [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) are evaluated in detail. It is found that PCDSeBT simultaneously has a low - lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level at -5.4 eV and a low bandgap of 1.70 eV as required by the ideal polymers for BHJ PSCs. The high current of 11.7 mA / cm^2 is obtained for PCDSeBT - based PSCs , to our knowledge , which is among the highest short - circuit current density ( J SC ) values obtained from a BHJ device consisting of PCDTBT derivatives and [6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ). The high J SC value , along with a moderate fill factor ( FF ) of 45% and a high open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.79 V , yields a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 4.12% , which is about 37% increase in PCE from a PCDTBT - based reference device. On the basis of our results , one can be concluded that the DSeBT placement for construction of donor (D)-acceptor ( A ) polymers is an easy and effective way to realize both the higher J SC and V OC values in PSCs , as a consequence of the selective lower - lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) with the HOMO being almost unchanged , together with the effective broadening on the absorption band . With deep understanding of efficient photoinduced electron transfer within an interpenetrating network by simple blending π-conjugated polymers ( electron donor ) with fullerene derivatives ( electron acceptor ) , 1 bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) : [6,6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) have been extensively investigated , leading to great progress in power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of 4-5 % . 2 Yet , the PCE of P3HT - based PSCs is limited by its relatively large bandgap ( ∼ 1.9 eV ) with major loss of the solar radiation as well as low open circuit - voltage ( V OC ≅ 0.6 V ) due to the relatively small energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) of P3HT and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) of PCBM.",

    "sentence": "By taking into consideration using low bandgap polymers to harvest more solar photons , researchers have devoted much effort recently to reducing the bandgap of polymers. This approach has provided a remarkable short - circuit current density ( J SC ) of 16 mA / cm^2 , 3 whereas , in general , the V OC has suffered 4 because of a higher than the HOMO optimal energy level in order to pursue a lower bandgap. In the PSCs community , poly(2,7-carbazole-altdithienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDTBT ) is one excellent exam - ple for a low HOMO ( -5.45 eV ) as required by the ' ideal ' πconjugated polymers , which led to a high V OC value over 0.8 V and outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures. 5 The initial PCE reached 3.6% 6 in a typical BHJ device and has been subsequently improved to exceeding 6% by BHJ layer thickness optimization and nanomorphology control using mixed solvent mixtures. 7 However , the bandgap of PCDTBT is still relatively larger than the proposed 1.5 - 1.7 eV of the ideal polymers for PCEs exceeding 10% . Recently , to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT without sacrificing its high V OC , Hsu et al. 8 and our group 9 independently reported PCDTBT - based ladder - type polymers with forced planarity of which device performance showed impressive PCEs of up to 4.59% with reduced bandgap ( ca. 0.2 eV ) in comparison with that of PCDTBT. However , the multiple synthetic steps for the ladder - type PCDTBTs have restricted the realization for their usage in BHJ devices. Herein , we present an easily obtainable selenophene analogue of PCDTBT , namely , poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-diselenienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDSeBT ) by replacing thiophenes with selenophene rings in the polymer backbone. Such a structural modification would be expected the lower - lying LUMO with the HOMO being largely unaffected due to the individual effects of the smaller ionization potential ( IP ) and almost the same electronegativity of selenium relative to sulfur atom. 10 In addition , interchain - charge transfer should be facilitated by intermolecular Se°°°Se contacts , most likely leading to a widen absorption band and enhanced mobility that are desirable for high photocurrents. 11 Our preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic properties of PCDSeBT in typical BHJ devices with [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) shows a highly respectrable PCE of 4.12% on account of the high J SC and V OC . The synthetic routes to the monomers ( M1 and M2 ) and PCDSeBT are shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were synthesized according to the previously reported procedures. 5a,12 The diboronic ester monomer M1 was easily synthesized from precursor 3 , by dilithiation at -78 °C , followed by quenching with 2-iso-propoxy-4,4,5,5-tetrametyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane in anhydrous THF in a yield of 79% .",

    "sentence": "As the key building block selenium - containing heterocyclic intermediate di(2′-selenienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole ( DSeBT ) 6^12 was prepared by Pd - catalyzed Stille coupling reaction of dibromobenzothiadiazole 4 and monostannylselenophene 5 , which was then dibrominated by N-bromosuccinimide ( NBS ) to yield comonomer M2 ( 2 steps , 52% overall yield ). The target poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-diselenienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDSeBT ) was obtained by Suzuki polymerization of M1 and M2 in degassed toluene / water with K 3 PO 4 as an organic base , Pd 2 ( dba ) 3 as a catalyst , and P(o-tol) 3 as the corresponding ligand at 90 °C for 3 days. The crude polymer was purified by reprecipitation and Soxhlet extraction with methanol , acetone , hexane , and chlorobenzene. Details of synthesis of monomers , polymerization , and their characterizations are given in the Experimental Section. After purification , gel - permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis against PS standard exhibits a number - averaged molecular mass ( M n ) of 83^000 g / mol with a polydispersity ( PDI ) of 2.51. The polymer is readily soluble in common solvents such as chloroform , toluene , THF , and chlorobenzene. As shown in Figure 1a , the UV - vis absorption spectra of PCDSeBT both in chloroform solution and solid state exhibit two distinct absorption bands , as typically observed for donor (D)-acceptor ( A ) low bandgap materials. The absorption maxima ( λ max ) of the film are located at 403 and 589 nm. The shorter absorption band is due to π-π* transitions of the polymer backbone , 13 while the lower - energy peak is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) in the electron - rich and electron - deficient units. 14 It is worth noting that the maxima absorption values of PCDSeBT in the film are slightly broadened without any obvious red - shift when compared to the solution. This verifies that only a small reorganization via π-π stacking between the polymer chains is within view during the film formation because of the interchain aggregates in solution. 15 This observation is in contrast to many conjugated polymers , in which there is a red - shift that occurs in going from the solution to the solid state due to the aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state , 3,16 even the PCDTBT film is red - shifted by 30 nm vs solution. 5a Besides , the deep blue color of PCDSeBT solution is observed unlike the red color of PCDTBT in solution ( see the digital photograph in Figure 1a ). Notably , although the absorption profile of PCDSeBT is similar to that of the thiophene analogue , PCDTBT , the absorption onset of PCDSeBT is significantly red - shifted by ∼ 70 nm , corresponding to a lower optical bandgap ( E g opt = 1.70 eV ) than PCDTBT ( E g opt = 1.85 eV ).",

    "sentence": "This apparently demonstrates that , in agreement with earlier studies and experimental studies , 17 the replacement of thiophene with selenophene results in a reduction of the optical bandgap due to the increase of quinoid character in the polymer backbone. 18 In a closer look of the film absorptions , it is also found that the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of PCDSeBT ( 155 nm ) is wider than that of PDCTBT ( 140 nm ) , as a matter of a characteristic of strong intermolecular Se°°°Se interactions , which can potentially further increase J SC value. The electrochemical properties of PCDSeBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). As shown in Figure 1b , PCDSeBT exhibits clear reversible n - doping / dedoping processes in the negative potential range , whereas quasi-reversible p - doping / dedoping behaviors in the positive potential range are observed. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be -5.40 eV and -3.70 eV , respectively , using the ferrocene - ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc+ ) redox couple ( 4.8 eV below the vacuum level ). Both PCDTBT and PCDSeBT have nearly identical HOMO energy levels , but PCDSeBT exhibits 0.10 eV lower - lying LUMO level relative to PCDTBT ( LUMO = -3.60 eV , see also Supporting Information ) , 5a verifying our presumption aforementioned about the effect of selenium on the selective fine - tuning of LUMO level. The material - design rules described by Scharber et al. 19 suggested that the PCEs of a BHJ solar cell should be much more sensitive to changes of the donor LUMO level compared to variations of the donor bandgap. On the basis of the rules , the estimated PCE from the E g opt and the LUMO value of PCDSeBT is 7.8% . This theoretical value is much higher than that of PCDTBT ( 6.5% ) , indicating that a highly promising material for PSCs considering the frontier orbital energies. Upon utilizing a model dimeric system containing methyl groups , the optimized molecular geometry of PCDSeBT and its frontier molecular orbitals of the calculated HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces were computed by density functional theory ( DFT , B3LYP / 6-31G ) ( Figure 1d ). The HOMO of PCDSeBT is well - distributed along the conjugated chains ; its LUMO is mainly centralized on BT accepting core as shaped by orbital lobes , being predicted a p - type organic semiconductor. In order to corroborate the effect of the heteroatom substitution on charge transporting properties of the polymers , top - contact organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) were fabricated using solution processed PCDTBT and PCDSeBT , respectively , as the semiconducting layer on the octadecyltrichlorosilane ( OTS ) self - assembled monolayer (SAM)-modified Si / SiO 2 substrates ( see the detailed devices fabrication in the Experimental Section ).",

Linear plot of I ds 1 / 2 vs V gs deduced from the I ds vs V gs measurement. These devices show characteristics of a typical p-channel transistor with good drain - current Modulation , well - defined linear , and saturation regions ( Figure 2 ). The summary of the performances is provided in Table 1. I ds = ( W / 2L ) × μ × C i ( V gs - V th ) The OFET device using as-cast PCDTBT films without thermal annealing exhibits a hole mobility of 2.2 × 10^-4 cm^2 / V°s with an on / off current ratio ( I on / I off ) of 4.44 × 10^3 . For PCDTBT thin films after annealing at evaluated temperatures , the mobilities are not markedly improved , implying that the PCDTBT thin films remain nearly amorphous for both as-cast and annealing at high temperature. On the other hand , it is found that the unannealed thin films of PCDSeBT exhibit a slightly higher mobility of μ h = 5.1 × 10^-4 cm^2 / V°s , compared with that of pristine PCDTBT. Interestingly , in contrast , as the PCDSeBT thin films are annealed at a temperature of 120 and 150 °C , the mobilities are systematically improved up to 1.0 × 10^-3 cm^2 / V°s ( Figure 2b ) , which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of PCDTBT , possibly due to increased interpolymer chain contact induced by Se°°°Se interactions with the thermal annealing process. To gain a better understanding of the influence of the thermal annealing , the crystallinity and molecular organization of PCDTBT and PCDSeBT thin films were investigated by Xray diffraction ( XRD ) , both before and after annealing at 150 °C . Both the as-cast and annealed PCDTBT thin films fail to reveal any defined scattering patterns ( Figure 3a ) , indicating the macroscopically disordered , amorphous structure. In the case of PCDSeBT , the as-cast thin films show very weak diffractions ( Figure 3b ). Upon thermal annealing , the primary peak at 4.42 ° , corresponding to a d-spacing of 19.99 Å , progressively intensifies and the secondary broad peak at ∼ 21.1 ° ( d = 4.21 Å ) that is probably related to π-π stacking becomes visible ( Figure 3b ). On the basis of these XRD results , we can conclude that the oriented microstructure of the as-cast PCDSeBT thin films is kinetically limited but the polymer chains reorganize to ordered lamellar packing structures upon annealing. This observation is a plausible explanation for the sudden rise in mobility of PCDSeBT as a function of the thermal annealing.",

The PCDSeBT : PC71BM weight ratio was optimized from 1 : 1 , 1 : 2 , 1 : 3 , to 1 : 4. The current-density-voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the devices under the illumination of simulated AM 1.5G conditions ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) are shown in Figure 4a and the parameters are summarized in Table 2. Without extensive optimization , the initial device fabricated from the blend solutions with a PCDSeBT : PC71BM weight ratio of 1 : 1 shows a PCE of 0.73% with a J SC of 2.98 mA / cm^2 , a V OC of 0.71 V , a fill factor ( FF ) of 35% . As increasing the weight fraction of PC71BM , the PCEs are gradually increased. The device containing the 1 : 4 w / w blend as the photoactive layer after thermal annealing at 150 °C delivers at superior performance with the J SC of 11.7 mA / cm^2 , V OC of 0.79 V , and FF of 45% , improving the PCE to 4.12% , an approximately 37% enhance - ment in PCE , when compared to the reference cell based on PCDTBT : PC71BM for the sake of comparison ( see SI ). 20 It is worth noting that the J SC , to the best of our knowledge , is among the highest J SC s reported to date for PCSs based on PCDTBT analogues , 5,8,21 in a good agreement with the 1.0 × 10^-3 4.0 × 10^4 -13 a All device characteristics were obtained from the devices ( L = 50 μm and W = 1.5 mm ) based on OTS - treated Si / SiO 2 substrates. b The on / off current ratio ( I on / I off ) were extracted from the linear - regime transfer characteristics. In order to ensure the accuracy of the measurements , we investigated the incident photon - to - current efficiency ( IPCE ) spectrum of the optimized device ( 1 : 4 w / w ) , exhibiting over 65% at the energetically lower peak , i.e. at the λ max of PCDSeBT ( Figure 4b ). The J SC value calculated by integrating the IPCE data with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum is rather consistent with that obtained from J-V plots within 10% error. Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was performed to gain insight into the surface morphology of the optimized 1 : 4 w / w blend films ( Figure 5 ). The films before and after thermal annealing have smooth surface topographies and very similar features , where the formation of voids , typically attributed to incompatibility between donor and acceptor components , is not observed.",

    "sentence": "However , the rms roughness is somewhat reduced to from 0.47 to 0.43 nm with thermal treatment , being favorable for charge separation and transport. This can reasonably explain the enhanced efficiency via the postannealing effect. Note that , in stark contrast to PCDTBT : PC71BM system in which thermal annealing reduced the photovoltaic parameters ( FF , J SC , and V OC ) , 22 the performance of all PCDSeBT - based devices for this study is considerably improved as a result of thermal treatment. We can conclude that the formation of crystalline nanoscale domains would be slightly induced in PCDSeBT : PC71BM with a thermal treatment in consequence of the ordered crystalline nature of the PCDSeBT on annealing as supported by the XRD results above as well as the large quinoidal character in the polymer backbone as the inclusion of selenophene. 23 The AFM of the annealed film gives an evidence for slightly nanofibril - like organization ( see Figure 5b ). The hole and electron mobilities of PCDSeBT : PC71BM ( 1 : 4 w / w ) blends were measured using the space - charge - limited current ( SCLC ) method and the J-V characteristics were plotted in Figure 6. The hole mobility ( μ hole = 4.68 × 10^-5 cm^2 / V°s ) obtained with the thermally annealed film is one order higher than that without post annealing ( μ hole = 4.02 × 10^-6 cm^2 / V°s ) , whereas in the both cases , the electron mobilities ( μ electron ) are similar ( 1.24 × 10^-3 and 5.58 × 10^-3 cm^2 / V°s ) for as-cast and annealed films , respectively , yielding a smaller difference between the mobility ratio for the annealed film. The higher mobilities and more balanced charge transport should definitely favor the charge transportation in the blend film and lead to high solar cell performance , supporting the b e n e fi c i a l e ff e c t o f t h e t h e r m a l a n n e a l i n g o n PCDSeBT : PC71BM cells . In conclusion , diselenienylbenzothiadiazole ( DSeBT ) units have successfully been incorporated into a D-A polymer backbone by Suzuki polymerization with 2,7-carbazole comonomer , affording a poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-diselenienylbenzothiadiazole) ( PCDSeBT ) ; This design motif is that replacement of thiophenes to selenophene units in PCDTBT that acts as a superior p - type photoactive material for PSCs , induces a lower bandgap ( 1.70 eV ) than that of PCDTBT ( 1.85 eV ) , while the ideal HOMO energy level ( -5.40 eV ) is still maintained.",

    "sentence": "their ter-polymers containing perylene units were synthesized using Suzuki coupling polymerization. The perylene units were introduced to improve the charge - transport ability by enhancing the π-π interaction between polymer chains. The resulting polymers were characterized by 1H NMR , elemental analysis , DSC , and TGA. The synthesized polymers were soluble in common organic solvents , and formed smooth and uniform spin - coated thin films. All of the polymers studied were found to exhibit good thermal stability , losing less than 5% of their weight upon heating to approximately 350 ° C. Perylene-containing polymers showed higher field - effect mobilities than the corresponding PFDTBT or PFD2TBT polymers because of the enhanced π-π interaction between polymer chains upon the introduction of perylene units. Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al. The devices using the perylene-containing polymers showed higher short - circuit currents , and fill factors than the corresponding PFDTBT or PFD2TBT devices. One of the fabricated devices using a perylene-containing copolymer showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.16% , with a short circuit current density of 9.61 mA / cm^2 , open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , and fill factor of 41% . Extensive research has been carried out during the past decade on bulk heterojunction solar cells that utilize organic semiconducting materials. 1 The main advantages of organic photovoltaic devices ( OPVs ) are their lightweight , flexible nature , and their cost - effective manufacture by various printing technologies. The photoconversion process in OPVs is accomplished by efficient light absorption by conjugated polymers and accepting materials , charge separation at the interface of the donor polymer and the accepting materials , and subsequent charge collection at the electrodes. Matching the absorption of the conjugated polymer to the solar spectrum determines the ultimate performance of the solar cell. Among the variety of conjugated polymers that have been studied , poly(p-phenylenevinylene) ( PPV ) , 2 poly(alkylfluorene) ( PF ) , and polythiophene ( PT ) 3 derivatives are typical p - type electron donor materials. However , the performance of photovoltaic cells with these polymers is limited by their relatively large band gap energies , which are not yet optimized with respect to the solar spectrum. Therefore , the design and synthesis of new low - band gap polymers become very important to better harvest the solar spectrum , especially in the red and near - infrared ranges , which can lead to possible enhancements in the photocurrents of OPVs. 4 The most widely used approach for obtaining low - band gap structures is to utilize internal charge transfer ( ICT ) from an electron - donating to an electron - accepting moiety. 5-7 Some interesting structures using the ICT approach have been reported.",

    "sentence": "For ( PCPDTBT ) , which showed absorption in the range 380-900 nm in the AM 1.5 G spectrum , good hole mobility ( 0.01 - 0.1 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) and a high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.2% with PC71BM as the electron acceptor. 8,9 A 9.9dialkylfluorene unit has previously been used as a building block for constructing donor - acceptor - type conjugated polymers in OPVs such as poly[2,7-(9,9′-dialkylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] ( PFDTBT ). PFDTBT showed a maximum PCE of 2.2% , and PFDTBT derivatives containing branched alkyl chains ( BisDMO - PFDTBT ) showed higher PCEs. 10,11 Some molecules and polymers that have flat structures such as fluorene , 12-16 anthracene , 17 and pyrene 18,19 have been reported to form excimers or aggregates by strong interchain π-π interactions. Excimer formation could affect the emission properties of molecules or polymers , therefore , the excimer or exciplex formation has been used as a fluorescence probe for molecular recognition. 19 In organic photovoltaic devices , π-π interactions between low - band gap donor polymers are important for charge transportation. Enhanced π-π interactions in p - type donor polymers could improve their chargetransport ability , and thus increase short - circuit currents in solar cells. In this study we report on a new approach to improve PCE of OPVs by enhancing the interchain π-π interaction. To do this we introduced flat perylene units into the conjugated polymers. We synthesized poly[2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] ( PFDTBT ) , poly[2,2′-(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)dithiophene-alt-5,5′-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] ( PFD2TBT ) , and their ter-polymers with perylene units. Optical , electrical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated. Synthetic routes and polymer structures are shown in Schemes 1 and 2 . The UV - visible absorption spectra of the synthesized polymers were recorded in both chloroform solution and as a solid thin film. PFDTBT and the ter-polymer solutions exhibited two distinct absorption bands , where the first absorption peak is at around 387 nm , corresponding to the π-π* transition of the conjugated polymer backbone , 23,24 and the second absorption band in the longer wavelength region at around 530 nm , can be attributed to the strong internal charge - transfer ( ICT ) interaction between donating and accepting groups in the main chain. 21 Peak and edge positions were almost equivalent for PFDTBT , PFDTBT_5Per and PFDTBT_10Per , but the maximum absorption peak for PFDTBT_20Per moved to a shorter wavelength region. This might be due to a decrease in the internal charge - transfer ( ICT ) interaction cause by a decreased content of electron - withdrawing DTBT monomer in the copolymer. PFD2TBT and the ter-polymer solutions also exhibited two absorption bands at around 410 and 520 nm. The absorption maxima and edges of the polymer solutions showed little dependence upon perylene contents. The UV - visible absorption spectra of the synthesized polymers in a chloroform solution are shown in Figure 2.",

    "sentence": "The polymer thin films showed a similar absorption trend ; however , the films showed increasingly larger redshifts in absorption than those for the solution as shown in Figure 3. A strong interchain interaction between polymer chains in the solid state would result in the red - shifting of the absorption peak and the onset. Optical band - gaps of the polymers were obtained from the absorption onsets of the polymer films. The measured optical band gaps of the copolymers were in the range 1.95 - 1.82 eV. 3.4. Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was employed to investigate the redox behavior of the polymers and to determine their HOMO and LUMO energy levels. 25 CV was performed under an Ar atmosphere in a solution of TBABF 4 ( 0.10 M ) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV / s and room temperature. A platinum plate was used as a working electrode. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode , and a Ag / AgNO 3 electrode was used as the reference electrode. The HOMO energy level was determined by using oxidation onsets ( E ox ) of the polymer films. 26 The LUMO energy levels of the polymers were determined by combining the HOMO energy levels obtained from CV and the optical bandgap energies obtained from the edges of absorption. 26 To obtain the oxidation potentials of the polymer films , the reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene / ferrocenium ( Fc / Fc + ) salt couple , whose redox potential is assumed to have an absolute energy level of -4.80 eV in a vacuum. 26 The potential of this external standard determined under the same conditions was 0.4 eV. As a result , the HOMO energy values were calculated using the equation E HOMO = -(E ox onset + 4.4 ) eV , where E ox onset is the onset oxidation potential vs Ag / Ag + . The HOMO energy levels of PFDTBT , PFD2TBT , and the ter-polymers were determined to lie in the range from -5.58 to -5.41 eV. Optical band gap energies show little change with by changing perylene unit ratios , but the HOMO energy levels of the polymers were moved slightly toward higher positions with the introduction of perylene units , as illustrated in Figure 4. This arises from the result of a decrease in the contents of high electron affinity DTBT units as the number of perylene units in the polymers increased. 27 The UV - visible absorption spectra , optical band - gaps , and HOMO / LUMO energy levels of the polymers are summarized in Table 2. 3.5. TFT Characteristics of the Polymer Thin Films. To measure the field effect mobility of the charge carriers , OTFT were fabricated on a silicon wafer using a bottom contact geometry ( channel length L = 12 μm , and width , W = 120 μm ) under nitrogen.

    "sentence": "Figure 5 shows the transfer curves of the devices fabricated using the polymers as the active layer. The field - effect mobility was calculated in the saturation regime using the following equation : I ds = ( W / 2 , where I ds is the drain - source current in the saturated region , W and L are the channel width and length , respectively , μ is the field - effect mobility , C i is the capacitance per unit area of the insulating layer , and V gs and V th are the gate and threshold voltages , respectively. 28,29 Interestingly , the fieldeffect mobility increased with an increase in the number of perylene units in the corresponding parent polymers. The fieldeffect mobility for PFDTBT , PFDTBT-5Per , PFDTBT-10Per , and PFDTBT-20Per was determined to be 1.0 × 10^-4 , 1.2 × 10^-4 , 5.3 × 10^-4 , and 1.2 × 10^-3 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively. Similarly , the measured field - effect mobility of PFD2TBT , PFD2TBT-5Per , and PFD2TBT-10Per was 2.7 × 10^-6 , 1.1 × 10^-5 , and 2.1 × 10^-5 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively. This result suggests that the introduction of the flat perylene structure to PFDTBT and PFD2TBT plays an important role in increasing the carrier mobility , possibly due to the enhanced interchain π-π interaction. The characteristics of the TFTs using the polymers as the active layers are summarized in Table 3. 2L)μC i ( V gs - V th ) 3.6. Photovoltaic Properties. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using PFDTBT , PFD2TBT and the ter-polymers as p - type electron donors and by using [6,6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as an n - type acceptor. Two different types of photovoltaic devices were fabricated and characterized , with the device structures of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al and ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al shown in Figure 6. The solutionprocessable titanium suboxide ( TiO x ) layer was employed as an optical spacer 30,31 and as a hole blocker 27 between the bulk heterojunction(BHJ) layer and the top metal electrode. Figure 7 shows the current - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices. It can be observed that the open circuit voltages of cells fabricated using PFDTBT and its ter-polymers range from 0.70 to 0.77 V. The device fabricated using PFDTBT showed higher open circuit voltages than those of perylene-containing copolymers. This coincides with the relative HOMO energy levels of the polymers. As the perylene content in the copolymers increased , the amount of DTBT contents decreased , and so the HOMO of the polymers moved to higher energy levels. PFDTBT has the deepest HOMO energy level , thus it showed the highest open circuit voltage ( 0.77 V ).",

    "sentence": "It is also noteworthy that , the short circuit current of the devices increased with an increase in the number of perylene units in the polymer , except for the case of PFDTBT_20Per. Even though PFDTBT_20Per showed the highest hole mobility among the PFDTBT - based copolymers , it is UV - visible absorption spectrum showed greater blue - shifting than PFDTBT , as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , and it showed the widest band gap energy among all of the polymers considered herein. This may be why the short circuit current of the device fabricated using PFDTBT_20Per is lower than that of PFDTBT , despite it higher mobility. The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the best photovoltaic performance among the PFDTBT - based polymers ( V oc = 0.74 V , J sc = 7.19 mA / cm^2 , PCE = 2.16% ). For the photovoltaic devices fabricated using PFD2TBT - based polymers , the shortcircuit currents of the devices also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased ; however , the PCEs of the devices using PFD2TBT - based polymers were lower than those of PFDTBT - based polymers because of lower open - circuit voltages and short - circuit currents. The device fabricated using PFD2TBT_10Per showed the highest PCE ( 1.51% ) among the PFD2TBT - based polymers. The characteristics of the ITO / 4. Figure 8 shows that the J-V characteristics of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices provide a similar trend to those of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / LiF / Al devices but their PCEs increased mainly due to increased short circuit currents. The increase in the short circuit current originates from the introduction of the thin titanium suboxide ( TiO x ) layer ( ca. ∼ 10 nm ). The titanium suboxide layer could block holes to the aluminum electrode , thus it could increase the short circuit current of the photovoltaic device. The device fabricated using PFDTBT-10Per showed the highest PCE of 3.16% with an open circuit voltage of 0.81 V , a short circuit current of 9.61 mA / cm^2 and the highest fill factor ( 0.41 ) among the fabricated devices. The characteristics of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / TiO x / Al devices are summarized in Table 5. Figure 9 shows the incident photon - to - current conversion efficiency ( IPCE ) spectra of the ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PFDTBT-10Per + PC71BM / LiF and TiO x / Al devices. The absorption onset corresponding to the photon - to - current conversion efficiency was about 750 nm for these devices , and the absorption onset values corresponding to the maximum conversion efficiency values were 427 and 560 nm. The morphologies of the polymers and PC71BM blend films were observed by tapping - mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ).",

    "sentence": "Figure 10 shows the AFM images of the polymer : PC71BM ( 1 : 5 wt % ) films , which were taken after removal of the Al electrode and after device fabrication. The Al electrode was removed by dipping the devices for 1 min in a mixed acid solution containing of 16 mL of concentrated phosphoric acid , 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid , 1 mL of acetic acid , and 2 mL of D 2 O. The blend films showed almost equivalently measured smooth surfaces ( according to their root-mean-square ( rms ) roughness ) with small degrees of phase separation. The rms roughness of the active layers were 0.49 nm for PFDTBT , 0.44 nm for PFDTBT-10Per , 0.51 nm for PFD2TBT , and 0.50 nm for PFD2TBT-10Per , respectively. This result suggests that the morphologies of all the active films are very similar , so that such a property will not affect the J sc of the photovoltaic devices. Therefore , the improvement of PCE and J sc in the fabricated photovoltaic devices is derived from the enhanced π-π interaction between polymers that results from the introduction of perylene units . We introduced perylene units into PFDTBT and PFD2TBT to enhance the interchain π-π interaction. The optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized copolymers showed were slight modification upon perylene addition. Interestingly , the field - effect mobility of the TFTs , using the polymers as the active layer increased with an increasing perylene content in the copolymers. The short circuit currents of the photovoltaic devices fabricated using the polymers as an electron donor , also increased as the perylene content in the copolymers increased , which is consistent with the field - effect mobility results of the polymers. We conclude that the introduction of perylene to the conjugated polymer chain enhances the π-π interaction between polymer chains and improves its charge - transport ability , leading to increases short circuit currents in the photovoltaic devices .

The hole mobility of the pristine PSFDTBT film spin - cast from o-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) solution is 7.26 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10^5 . Polymer solar cell devices based on the blend films of PSFDTBT and PC71BM show a high open - circuit voltage of 0.94 V and a power conversion efficiency of 4.6% without any post-treatment. All the device measurements were performed in air without encapsulation. This is the first report on spirobifluorene - based conjugated polymers used for polymer solar cells , demonstrating the great potential of spirobifluorene moiety as an electron - donating unit for the construction of main chain donor - acceptor alternating conjugated polymers for high performance polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) , as the most promising sustainable energy source alternative to inorganic - based solar cells , have received intensive attention in both academia and industry in recent years. 1 In comparison with inorganic solar cells , PSCs have the potential advantages of lightweight , flexibility , and manufacturing by low cost roll - to - roll process. 2 Up to date , bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure , in which the active layer consists of an interpenetrating blend of electron donating conjugated polymers and electron accepting fullerene derivatives , is still the most useful active layer structure for high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) polymer solar cells. 1,3 Intensive researches worldwide on polymer design and device fabrication have led to a rapid development in the field of PSCs. 1,4 Recently , power conversion efficiency higher than 7% for BHJ polymer solar cells has been achieved by several groups through the developing of new polymer donor materials with the use of [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or [6,6]phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as electron acceptors. 4a-i For the designing high power conversion efficiency donor polymers , the following three points should be considered : 5 ( 1 ) the polymer should have appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels for harvesting as more photons as possible from solar radiation ; 5b ( 2 ) the polymer / PCBM blend films should have high and balanced carrier mobility for generating more free charge carriers and efficiently collecting them at corresponding electrodes ; 6 ( 3 ) the polymer should be soluble in common organic solvent for solution processing. 7 Main chain donor - acceptor alternating design is a very efficient way to engineer the band gap of conjugated polymers through the internal charge transfer from donor to acceptor unit.",

    "sentence": "4a-n,8 Main chain donor - acceptor alternating conjugated polymers with 9,9-dialkylfluorene as donor unit and benzothiadiazole as acceptor unit have been extensively studied as donor components in BHJ PSCs. 9 PCE of polymer solar cells based on 9,9-dialkylfluorene moieties has been improved to 4.5% with an open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of almost 1 V. 10 Compared with the large number of publications on 9,9dialkylfluorene based D-A alternating copolymers applied in PSCs , less attention was paid to spirobifluorene - based copolymers. In the past few years , spirobifluorene has been used as an ideal building block in construction of stable blue light - emitting materials. 11 In the spiro - annulated molecules , the two perpendicular conjugated moieties are connected with the sp 3 -hybridized carbon atom as the spiro center. This structural feature can minimize the extravagant aggregation of polymers containing spiro - annulated molecules and thus can improve their solubility and processability. 11,12 Furthermore , the spirobifluorene structure can prevent the possible photo / thermal oxidation of the 9-position of the fluorene unit to form the undesired low energy ketonic defect. 13 In theory , stable polymer structures are beneficial for the long lifetime of polymer solar cells. Here , we demonstrate for the first time that spirobifluorene can be a very useful building block to construct main chain donor - acceptor alternating conjugated polymer , poly[2,7-(3′,6′-dioctyloxy)-9,9′-spirobifluorene-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-5′,6′-dioctyloxy-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] ( PSFDTBT ) as shown in Scheme 1 , for high efficiency polymer solar cells. The octyloxy chains on spirobifluorene and 2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole units can provide PSFDTBT with good solubility in common organic solvents. The transport properties of the polymer are investigated by fabricating organic thin film field - effect transistors ( OFETs ). The pristine PSFDTBT film spin - cast from DCB solution exhibited hole mobility of 7.26 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10^5 . The PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films show hole mobility of 1.14 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and an electron mobility of 2.7 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Under simulated solar illumination of AM 1.5G ( 100 mW / cm^2 ) , a PCE of 4.6% has been achieved for PSCs composed of PSFDTBT and PC71BM as the active layer in simply processed devices. The devices illustrate a considerably high V oc of 0.94 V , a J sc of 8.0 mA / cm^2 , and a comparable fill factor ( FF ) of 0.60. All device measurements were conducted in air without any encapsulation. Noticeably , PSFDTBT exhibits significantly improved PSC performance when compares with the analogous 9,9-dialkyl-9H-fluorene based polymer P1 ( Scheme 1 ) , which showed general PSC performance with PCE of about 3.1% in our previous report.",

Because of the threedimensional structure of spirobifluorene units , PSFDTBT is readily dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform , chlorobenzene , toluene , THF , 1,2-dichlorobenzene ( DCB ) , 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene ( TCB ) , etc. at room temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) showed that PSFDTBT is of good thermal stability with less than 5% weight loss up to 340 ° C. No clear glass transition was observed from 25 to 300 °C in its DSC curves of the second heating and cooling runs ( 20 °C / min ). Optical and Electrochemical Properties. UV - vis absorption spectra of PSFDTBT in THF solution and in film are shown in Figure 1. In THF solution , PSFDTBT exhibited a broad absorption in the range of ultraviolet to visible region with two peaks located at 395 and 527 nm , respectively. In film , the absorption of PSFDTBT became broader and slightly redshifted with two peaks located at 401 and 562 nm , respectively. In comparison with the absorption spectrum in solution , the absorption spectrum in film became broader and red - shifted for about 35 nm , indicating the aggregation or ordered packing of polymer chains in solid state. Ordered packing of polymer chains is beneficial for improving the charge mobility of resulting films. 14 The optical absorption onset of PSFDTBT film is at 629 nm , corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.97 eV. PC71BM was chosen as the acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PC61BM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region with a broad peak from 440 to 530 nm , which compensates the absorption valley of the polymer. 15 As shown in Figure 1 , the PSFDTBT / PC71BM blending film ( 1 : 3 by weight ) has a strong absorption over a broad wavelength range of 400^-700 nm. The electrochemical properties of PSFDTBT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ). The HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT was determined to be -5.40 eV according to the equation E HOMO = -e(E ox + 4.71 ) ( eV ) , where E ox is the onset oxidation potential in volts vs Ag / Ag + . 16 Since the open circuit voltage V oc of BHJ PSCs is correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , 5,17 therefore a higher V oc for PSFDTBT based polymer solar cells is anticipated due to the low - lying HOMO energy level.",

The transport properties of the polymer were investigated by fabricating organic thin film fieldeffect transistors ( OFETs ). Typical p-channel field - effect transistor behavior was obtained. The hole mobility ( μ ) was estimated in the saturated regime from the derivative plots of the square root of source - drain current ( I SD ) versus gate voltage ( V G ) through equation 2 where W is the channel width , L is the channel length , C i is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer ( SiO 2 , 500 nm , C i = 7.5 nF / cm^2 ) , and V T is the threshold voltage. The output ( a ) and transfer characteristics ( b ) of the spin - coated PSFDTBT films are shown in Figure 2. The hole mobility of the pristine PSFDTBT film spin - cast from DCB solution is 7.26 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 with on / off ratios in the order of 10^5 , which is almost two orders higher than that of P1 ( the hole mobility of pure P1 film is 2 × 10^-5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). 8 Such comparable high mobility is beneficial for charge transfer in the resulting PSCs. 5 For the PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend film ( in a weight ratio of 1 : 3 , spin - coated from ODCB solutions ) , hole mobility ( μ hole ) of 1.14 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and electron mobility ( μ e ) of 2.7 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 were obtained.

Such high V oc of almost 1 V is consistent with the low - lying HOMO energy level of PSFDTBT. In comparison with the device performance of P1 based PSCs , 8 devices based on PSFDTBT exhibited almost identical V oc , but higher J sc and much higher FF. As shown in Table 1 , the optimized devices based on P1 showed a PCE of 3.1% with a V oc of 0.97 V , a J sc of 6.7 mA / cm^2 , and an FF = 0.47. It is well - known that the processing solvent can dramatically affect the morphology of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance of devices. When the solvent was changed from DCB to TCB , the photovoltaic performance could be further improved. As shown in Table 1 , when the active layer was PSFDTBT / PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1 : 3 , the highest PCE of 4.6% with a V oc of 0.94 V , a J sc of 8.0 mA / cm , and an FF of 0.60 was achieved. J-V curves of polymer solar cells fabricated with different weight ratio of PSFDTBT : PC71BM in TCB solutions are shown in Figure 3b. It is worth noting that such performance was achieved from simply fabricated devices without using any additive , posttreatment , or extra layers , which is beneficial for preparation of low cost polymer solar cells. To verify the accuracy of the J sc measurement results , external quantum efficiencies ( EQEs ) of solar cells were measured under illumination of monochromatic light. As shown in Figure 4 , solar cells , which were fabricated from PSFDTBT : PC71BM in a ratio of 1 : 3.5 ( w / w ) in DCB solutions and PSFDTBT : PC71BM in a ratio of 1 : 3 ( w / w ) in TCB solutions , both exhibited a broad photoresponse extending from 350 to 700 nm. Especially , the device based on a ratio of PSFDTBT to PC71BM of 1 : 3 ( w / w ) in TCB solutions exhibited the maximum EQE of 72% at 479 nm. The J sc calculated from integration of the EQE with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum roughly agreed with the J sc obtained from the J-V measurements. To understand the relationship between device performances and active layer morphology , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) measurements were conducted to investigate the surface morphology of PSFDTBT / PC71BM blend films.",

    "sentence": "In these two cases , AFM height images showed similar surface morphology with fairly small phase separation , and the root-mean-square ( rms ) values for the blend films from DCB and from TCB are 0.242 and 0.306 nm , respectively. These AFM results are consistent with their photovoltaic device performances ( vide supra ). The reason for that may be due to both DCB and TCB are good solvents for PSFDTBT. It is well - known that balanced electron and hole mobility of the active layer is required for high performance polymer solar cells. 2f The formation of an interpenetrating bicontinuous network between polymer donor and PCBM with an ideal domain size of 10-20 nm is crucial for charge generation and transportation. 18 For bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells , appreciate phase separation is a practical way to form bicontinuous donor - acceptor network. 19 We believe that the solar cell performance of this type of copolymer can be further improved by the optimization of film morphology and device fabrication conditions . An alternating copolymer PSFDTBT of spirobifluorene and 2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole unit was designed and synthesized. PSFDTBT shows a broad absorption , appropriate HOMO / LUMO positions , and comparable hole mobility. Without using any additive and any post-treatment , polymer solar cells based on PSFDTBT / PC71BM demonstrated a PCE of 4.6% with a high open - circuit voltage of 0.94 V. This is the first report on spirobifluorene - based polymers applied in BHJ PSCs. High open - circuit voltage , simple device fabrication process , and easy synthesis make PSFDTBT a highly promising donor polymers for high efficiency polymer solar cells. We believe that spirobifluorene as a promising building block for conjugated polymer donor materials warrants further exploration and the performance of PSFDTBT - based polymer solar cells can be further improved from the optimization of device fabrication conditions .",

    "sentence": "Highly soluble poly[quinacridone-alt-benzothiadiazole] ( PQCDTB ) has been synthesized through the Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing planar quinacridone and highly absorbing benzothiadiazole. The PQCDTB dissolved in general organic solvents , and the M n was 49.8 kg / mol. The optical band gap energy was 1.92 eV , which was similar to the band gap of benzothiadiazole. The HOMO and LUMO levels of PQCDTB were -5.24 eV and -3.32 eV , respectively. According to the XRD measurement , PQCDTB showed the formation of ordered lamellar structure as an out - of - plane peak ( h00 ) by the alkyl side chain of quinacridone and conventional edge-on πstacking. This study also evaluated the OPV characteristics by fabricating a bulk - heterojunction - type polymer solar cell. When PQCDTB and PC71BM were fabricated in a 1 : 1 weight ratio , the open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short - circuit current ( J SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8% and 2.5% , respectively. In particular , PQCDTB exhibited higher FFs compared with poly[carbazole-alt-benzothiadiazole] ( PCZDTB ) . For the past several decades , semiconducting polymers have been applied to various sectors , such as organic light emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , 1-4 organic photovoltaic cells ( OPVs ) 5-9 and organic thin film transistors ( OTFTs ). 10-13 Of these applications , OPVs have become mainstream , thanks to their outstanding economic feasibility and sustainable development. Nevertheless , a low power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) has been the largest obstacle in OPVs. 6 To improve the PCE , the following idealistic conditions are required in conjugated polymers : 14 ( 1 ) a low bandgap with a wide absorption area , ( 2 ) a crystalline structure to produce good charge transport characteristics , ( 3 ) a low highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level to produce a high open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) , and ( 4 ) an appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level for effective electron charge transfer to fullerene. To acquire good charge transport characteristics , it is necessary to increase the close packing among polymers through the reduction of energetic disorder by increasing the coplanarity and the interchain π-π interaction. In the Janssen group , a copolymer containing terthiophene was reported , which shows an increase in planarity packing and high mobility characteristics , and a diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative showed a PCE of 4.7% and a high hole mobility ( 0.04 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ). 15 In the Jen group , a hole mobility of 0.029 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 and a PCE of 6.2% were reported in a copolymer that contained an indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) unit and a phenanthrenequinoxaline unit.",

In the case of polymers , extremely limited results have been reported. 21,22 In the Takimiya group , recently , a polymer composed of QC derivatives has been reported for use in OTFTs that has a high hole mobility ( 0.2 cm^2 V -1 S^-1 ). 23 In this study , we synthesized a new donor - acceptor type ( D- A type ) polymer , poly[quinacridone-alt-octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole] ( PQCDTB ) , which contained QC and octyloxydithienylbenzothiadiazole ( DTB ). As a result , it is most likely that a broad absorbance could be obtained as the results of the effective charge transport and the strong electron - withdrawing caused by the high coplanarity . Table 1 shows the result of the molecular weight and the thermal properties of the obtained PQCDTB. As shown in this table , when the GPC was measured using polystyrene as the standard , the number - average molecular weights ( M n ) of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were 49.8 and 15.2 kg / mol , respectively. In contrast , the polydispersity indices ( PDIs ) showed a very narrow distribution of 1.92 and 1.77 , respectively. In terms of the degree of polymerization , PQCDTB was greater than other OPV polymers by 2-3 times because of the introduction of long , branched side chains of quinacridone and benzothiadiazole. As a result , the backbone structure became relatively favorable in terms of the solubility at polymerization ; polymerization had effectively occurred. 6 Table 1 showed the result of the thermal analysis through TGA. As shown in Table 1 , PQCDTB and PCZDTB had a 5% weight loss at the temperatures of 323 and 324 °C , respectively , displaying a high thermal stability because of the rigid QC and carbazole structure , which is applicable for optoelectronic devices and OPVs , both of which require a high thermal stability ( 300 °C or above ). 24 We investigated thermal behavior through DSC analysis ( see Supporting Information ) , which revealed no obvious thermal transitions for PQCDTB in the temperature range from 40 to 250 ° C.

    "sentence": "In the out - of - plane of PQCDTB , as shown Figure 1a , a sharp diffraction peak was observed at 4.0 , 8.1 , 12.2 ° , which indicates the formation of ordered lamellar structure as an out - of - plane peak ( h00 ) by the alkyl side chain of quinacridone and conventional edge-on πstacking. 5,14,23 The lamellar d-spacing ( d 1 ) was 21.8 Å ( λ = 2d[sin θ ] ). In the ( 010 ) in-plane pattern related to π-π stacking , as shown Figure 1b , a broad diffraction peak was detected at approximately 24.0 ° . Using the same calculation , the π-π stacking distance ( d π ) was 3.7 Å. The results are similar to thiophene and thiophene - fused aromatic system polymers that perform well as OPVs. 19,25 In the out - of - plane of PCZDTB , as shown in Figure 1a , no diffraction peak was observed in the thin film. As reported before , a broad diffraction peak was observed at approximately 20.5 ° in the diffraction of powdery PCZDTB ( see Supporting Information ). 26 The π-π stacking distance ( d π ) was 4.3 Å. The result was similar to the result for π-π stacking ( d π = 4.0 - 4.4 Å ) of fluorene-thiophene. The benzene-thiophene linkage has a twisted structure compared with the thiophenethiophene linkage. The structure has an impact on π-π stacking ( d π ) as well. 27 By calculating PCZDTB and PQCDTB using a density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation , the tilt angle has been comparatively analyzed. In terms of tilt angle , PCZDTB was 27-28 ° , while PQCDTB was 19-21 ° . Compared with PCZDTB , formation of a planar backbone and stronger π-π stacking were observed in PQCDTB ( see Supporting Information ). On the basis of this result , it has been confirmed that π-π stacking was more effective in PQCDTB than in PCZDTB because of coplanarity of the quinacridone unit that was introduced to the main chain of PQCDTB. 13 Figure 2 showed the UV - visible spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB. As shown in Figure 2 , the maximum absorption peak of PQCDTB ( λ max ) was observed at 389 and 539 nm , respectively , in solution ( 10^-6 M in chloroform ). On the other hand , the maximum absorption peaks of PCZDTB ( λ max ) were observed at 386 and 514 nm in solution. The band around 380 nm in the absorption spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB can be assigned to π-π* transition whereas the 530-550 band are due to intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between donor and acceptor moieties. 10 The absorption spectrum of PQCDTB is broadened and red - shifted compared to that of PCZDTB. This can be explained by the much stronger ICT effects in the PQCDTB than that in PCZDTB.",

    "sentence": "For the film , the maxima absorption spectra of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were red - shifted by 9-23 nm compared with the solution. These results are explained by their much more planar conformations in the solid state. 10 Figure 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram of PCZDTB and PQCDTB , which were measured in 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate acetonitrile. As reported by Lidzey et al. , the PCZDTB oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potential were + 1.09 and -1.37 V , respectively , and the HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.44 and -2.98 eV. In the case of PQCDTB , unlike the PQA2T ( poly[quinacridone-bithiophene] ) reported by Takimiya et al. , a clear oxidation - reduction peak was observed. 19 This type of result has been obtained because PQCDTB was D-A structured , unlike the typical p - type structure of PQA2T. In PQCDTB , the oxidation ( E ox onset ) and reduction ( E red onset ) onset potentials were + 0.89 and -1.36 V , respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels were -5.24 and -2.99 eV , respectively. Table 2 summarizes the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers. As shown in Table 2 , the HOMO level of PQCDTB ( -5.24 eV ) was higher than that of PCZDTB by 0.2 eV because the HOMO level of the QC derivative was higher than that of carbazole. The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference between the HOMO energy levels and the optical bandgap energies. According to the calculations , the LUMO levels of PQCDTB and PCZDTB were -3.32 and -3.46 eV , respectively. They slightly differed from the levels calculated through CV , but they mostly exhibited a similar tendency. Figure 4 shows the band diagram of the energy levels that have been obtained through DFT calculations and experiments. The bandgap energies of PQCDTB and PCZDTB determined through UV - vis spectra were reported as 1.98 and 1.92 eV , respectively , which were lower than the results of the DFT calculation by 0.57 and 0.55 V. 28 Because the HOMO level is lower than the P3HT HOMO level ( -4.9 eV ) in both polymers , a relatively high air stability could be obtained. 29 In the case of PQCDTB , the LUMO level ( -3.32 eV ) was higher than the PC71BM LUMO level ( -4.0 eV ) by 0.68 eV. However , the HOMO level ( -5.24 eV ) was lower than the PEDOT : PSS HOMO level ( -5.0 eV ) by 0.24 eV. Therefore , if charge separation occurs after receiving light energy , a hole would exhibit more effective charge transport than an electron in the active layer of PQCDTB. 14,26 Figure 5 and Table 3 show the results of evaluating the characteristics of an OPV device.",

    "sentence": "The devices are structured as As shown in Figure 5a and Table 3 , the device that blended PQCDTB and PC61BM in a 1 : 1 ratio had an open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.76 V , a short - circuit current ( J SC ) of 4.4 mA cm^-2 , a fill factor ( FF ) of 47.5% and a power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 1.6% . In the device that blended the PQCDTB and PC71BM in a 1 : 1 ratio , V OC , J SC , and FF were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , and 55.8% , respectively. In terms of PCE , approximately 56% was improved with 2.5% , compared with the device in which the PC61BM was applied as an acceptor. Because PC71BM is greater than PC61BM in terms of photon absorption at 400-500 nm , it was able to improve the PCE by increasing J SC . 6 The V oc of PQCDTB was greater than the widely known poly(3-hexylthiophene) , P3HT ( V oc = 0.5 - 0.6 V ). This type of result was obtained because PQCDTB ( -5.53 eV ) has a lower HOMO level than P3HT ( -4.9 eV ). 19,24 The value of FF for PQCDTB ( FF = 55.8% ) increased by 39% compared to PCZDTB ( FF = 40.1% ). The series resistance at PQCDTB and PC71BM ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 , as shown in Table 3 , was 31 and 27 Ω / cm^2 , respectively. In contrast , the series resistance at PCZDTB and PC71BM ratio of 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 was 320 , 62 Ω / cm^2 , respectively. The series resistance of PQCDTB exhibited low value compared to that of PCZDTB. The decrease of series resistance could increase FF. PQCDTB showed high FF than PCZDTB due to decrease of series resistance by self - organization of quinacridone unit. 9 Figure 5b showed the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) data of the fabricated device. When PQCDTB was used as a donor and PC61BM and PC71BM were used as acceptors , the device had 38% and 41% EQE at 480 nm , respectively. The photovoltaic devices with PC71BM as an acceptor showed higher EQE values than those with PC61BM as an acceptor , although they absorbed photons in the same range of the solar spectra. This was because PC71BM has a stronger UV - vis absorption property than does PC61BM in the visible region , especially near 500 nm. 30 Hence , the PCE improved with an increase in J SC . In a device that used PCZDTB as a donor , an EQE of 48% was observed at 440 nm. Interestingly , λ max was blue - shifted by -30 nm because of the low π-π stacking and the weak intermolecular interaction of PCZDTB compared with PQCDTB.",

    "sentence": "To investigate the morphology of the polymer / PCBM blend film , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was performed , and the result is shown in Figure 6. In Figure 6a , microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM , while the polymer formed a small fibril - type domain at a 1 : 1 PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio. As shown in Figure 6c , the fibril domain or microphase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size. It appears that this type of fibril domain occurred because PQCDTB formed effective π-π stacking based on outstanding crystallinity. 31 As shown in Figure 6b , in contrast , when the PQCDTB / PC71BM ratio was 1 : 2 , the polymers were assembled , and a large domain was formed. As a result , a relatively large - size phase separation took place. As shown in Figure 6d , the large domain or the large - size phase separation was clearer when measured at a 1 × 1 μm 2 size. The large - phase separation exhibits a low photocurrent by reducing the charge separation and increasing the exciton diffusion length and the recombination of electric charges. 32 Therefore , at a 1 : 2 polymer / PC71BM ratio , a large phase separation occurs between the polymer and the PC71BM. As a result , a low photocurrent would occur ; this is comparable to the 1 : 1 ratio. The same results were confirmed for the current device using the data in Table 3. Similar results were observed between PQCDTB and PC61BM as well. When the PCZDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 4 , a smooth morphology was detected , and no fibril domain was observed , just like the PQCDTB , because the self - organization of PCZDTB is lower than that of PQCDTB. 9 In this study , PQCDTB has been successfully synthesized through the Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing planar quinacridone unit and a broad - absorption benzothiadiazole unit. PQCDTB had a high molecular weight and good thermal stability. Because of the appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels , an effective balance was produced. According to the X-ray diffraction measurement , a broad diffraction peak was observed at approximately 24.0 ° . In terms of the π-π stacking distance ( d π ) , a significantly shorter distance ( 3.7 Å ) was observed. These values were similar to the results of the thiophene and thiophenefused aromatic system polymers. When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the highest efficiency was detected , and V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE were 0.79 V , 5.6 mA cm^-2 , 55.8% , and 2.5% , respectively. When the PQCDTB : PC71BM ratio was 1 : 1 , the polymer formed a fibril - type domain and microphase separation occurred between the polymer and PC71BM. Because of selforganization , PQCDTB showed a higher FF compared with PCZDTB.",

    "sentence": "Significant progress has been made in synthesis of conjugated polymers and their applications for optoelectronic device such as organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) , organic photovoltaic cells ( OPVs ) , and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) since Heeger , MacDiarmid , and Shirakawa discovered conducting polymers in 1976.^1 As a result of the low - cost , light - weight , and flexibility advantages , optoelectronic devices based on conjugated polymers are a promising cost - effective alternative to inorganic materials - based microelectronics. Conjugated polymers can be classified as hole ( p - type ) or electron ( n - type ) transporting materials according to the type of orderly transferring charge carriers. Most of conjugated polymers are p - type semiconductors that have seen a dramatic rise in performance over the past decade while much less attention has been devoted to n - type semiconducting polymers that have lagged behind their p - type counterparts. 2 Organic n - type materials are essential for the fabrication of organic p-n junctions , OPVs , n-channel OFETs , OLEDs , and complementary logic circuits. 3 The n - type building blocks are the core components in n - type semiconducting polymers. Aromatic imides such as rylene diimides are one of the classical n - type building blocks and can exhibit relatively high electron affinities , high electron mobilities , and excellent chemical , thermal , and photochemical stabilities. 4 These materials are electron deficient due to the substitution of an aromatic core with one or two sets of π-accepting imide groups that are mutually conjugated. The widely used rylene diimides include perylene diimides ( PDIs , 1 ) and naphthalene diimides ( NDIs , 2 ) ( Figure 1 ). Zhan and co-workers reported the synthesis of the first soluble rylene-based fully conjugated polymer. 5 Top-gate OFETs based on this PDI- dithienothiophene copolymer exhibited a saturation electron mobility ( μ e ) of 6 x 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , current on / off ratio ( I on / I off ) of 10^4 , and a low threshold voltage ( V th ) of 7 V in air. 6 Moreover , all - polymer solar cells based on blends of polythiophene derivative donors and PDI-dithienothiophene copolymer acceptors exhibited power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as high as 1.5% ( AM1.5 , 100 mW cm^-2 ). 7-9 Facchetti et al. reported a conjugated copolymer of NDI and bithiophene ; 10 OFET devices based on this polymer fabricated in a top-gate , bottom - contact configuration with polymeric dielectrics exhibited μ e of 0.1-0.85 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 under ambient conditions with I on / I off > 10^5 . 11 The simplest aromatic imide system is phthalimide ( 3 ) and thiophene imide ( 4 ) ( Figure 1 ).

    "sentence": "14 In particular , Guo et al. reported that OFETs based on a phthalimide - containing polythiophene exhibited hole mobilities of ∼ 0.2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 under ambient conditions without optimization. 14 Thiophene imide has simple , compact , symmetric , and planar structure. It could promote intrachain and interchain interactions along and between coplanar polymer chains. Zhang et al. pioneered to use thiophene imide as a building block in conjugated polymers. 15,16 Later , thiophene imide homopolymers were synthesized. 17-19 Recently , polymer solar cells based on blends of copolymers of thiophene imide and benzodithiophene 20-23 or cyclopentadithiophene 24 with soluble fullerene derivatives PC71BM or PC61BM exhibited PCEs of 3-6.8 % . Wudl et al. reported low - bandgap conjugated polymers based on thiophene - fused phthalimide , i.e. , isothianaphthene imides ( 5 , Figure 1 ). 25,26 2,2 0 -Bithiophene-3,3 0 -dicarboximide ( BTI , 6 , Figure 1 ) with π-core planarity , antiparallel BTI packing , a short cofacial π-π distance of 3.43 Å , and a favorable solubilizing group orientation is a promising building block in n - type polymers. 27 Facchetti et al. reported that n-channel OFET based on a bithiophene imide homopolymer exhibited a μ e of 1.1 x 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , I on / I off of 2 x 10^7 , and a high V th ( 75 V ) in vacuum after annealing process at 240 ° C. 27 The fused - ring system can maximize the π-orbital overlap by restricting intramolecular rotation in the oligomer and possibly to induce face - to - face π-stacking , facilitating charge transport through intermolecular hopping. On the other hand , the fused rings can make the polymer backbone more rigid and coplanar , therefore enhancing effective π-conjugation , lowering bandgap , and extending absorption. 28-31 Therefore , fused - ring building blocks are widely used in synthesis of conjugated polymers. 32-34 For example , the large planar benzodithiophene ( BDT ) unit has emerged as an attractive building block for conjugated polymers. 35 Benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene ( 7 , Figure 2 ) with a curved structure prevents a fully conjugated pathway between substituents at the 2-and 6-positions. Hence , delocalization of the conjugated π-electron system along the copolymer backbone is disfavored by the incorporation of this unit. This increases the ionization potential of the polymer and is thus expected to improve air stability under operation. Additionally , compared to a single thiophene ring , it must be pointed out that due to the large resonance stabilization energy of BDT , the delocalization of electrons from the BDT unit into the backbone is less favorable than from the thiophene ring. As a result , a more stable copolymer with high performance can be obtained by using BDT as the core unit. OFETs based on a benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene copolymer manufactured on flexible substrate exhibited high hole mobility of 0.5 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 when the source-gate voltage is increased to 60 V.",

    "sentence": "36 OPVs based on blends of benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene copolymers and PC61BM exhibited PCEs as high as 2.17% . 37-40 In this paper , we report creation of a new fused - ring building block dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 8 , Figure 2 ) and its application in design and synthesis of conjugated polymers. The combination of benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene planarity and efficient π-π stacking with the electron - withdrawing capacity of the imide functionality serves as the foundation for this new class of materials. Introduction of the π-electron - deficient imide moiety can decrease the HOMO and LUMO energies of the polymers , which is necessary for air - stable polymers. Furthermore , substitution at the imide nitrogen allows introduction of functionalities and solubility improvement with varying degrees of steric bulk while not impinging on critical intermolecular π-π stacking characteristics. This motif also leaves the benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b 0 ]dithiophene 2-and 7-positions available for polymerization. Finally , the dipole moment caused by the imide could stabilize cofacial antiparallel intra-and interchain repeat unit orientations , planarize the backbone , and promote π-π stacking. 27 On the basis of this new building block , we designed and synthesized a series of conjugated copolymers : unit 8 coupled with electron - rich unit benzo[1,2b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene ( P1 and P2 ) or with electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole ( P3 and P4 ) or benzo [c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole ( P5 ) and homopolymer ( P6 ) ( Figure 2 ). The optical properties and electronic structure ( HOMO / LUMO levels and bandgap ) can be manipulated through adjusting copolymerized building blocks. ' RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization. The synthetic routes to the monomers and polymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. We chose very cheap , industrial product maleic anhydride as a starting material. Bromination of maleic anhydride with Br 2 gave its dibromide ( 1 ). 41 Then , amination with alkylamine afforded the alkyl-substituted 3,4dibromopyrrole-2,5-dione ( 2a,b ). Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide 2a,b with 3-thienylboronic acid gave 3,4-bis(3-thienyl)pyrrole-2,5-dione ( 3a,b ). The large sulfur - containing polycyclic aromatic imides , dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 4a,b ) , were synthesized through iron(III) chloride - mediated oxidative cyclization , which is a general strategy for ring closure. 42 Bromination of 4a , b with Br 2 gave rise to the monomers 5a,b. Stille coupling reaction of 5a with tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane afforded 2,7-bis(2-thienyl)-dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide ( 6a ) , which was brominated with NBS to afford monomer 7a. Copolymers P1-P4 were synthesized through Stille coupling reaction of the dibromide monomers 5a,b or 7a with benzodithiophene-2,6-ditin or 2,2 0 -bithiazole-5,5 0 -ditin , while P5 was synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction of the dibromide monomer 5b with benzothiadiazole-4,7-diboronic ester. Homopolymer P6 was synthesized by palladium - catalyzed homocoupling of the dibromide 5b in the presence of hexabutylditin. P1 with three solubilizing n-dodecyl groups has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform , THF , and toluene.",

    "sentence": "However , P2 with thiophene spacer between two large units 8 and BDT has poor solubility due to more planar conformation and stronger interchain interactions caused by smaller torsion angle. To our surprise , P3 with three solubilizing n-alkyl groups also has poor solubility probably due to strong interchain interactions. Replacing n-dodecyl in P3 with 2-decyltetradecyl group significantly enhance solubility of P4. P5 and P6 also have good solubility. Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) using polystyrene standards as calibrants. The polymers P1 and P4-P6 show numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) of 12^250 , 9934 , 5714 , and 10^053 , with polydispersity indices ( M w / M n ) of 1.30 , 1.43 , 1.71 , and 1.56 , respectively ( Table 1 ). The GPC measurements for P2 and P3 are not carried out due to their low solubility. The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) under nitrogen ( Figure 2 ). The decomposition temperature ( T d ) at 5% weight loss for P3-P6 are above 330 °C , while P1 and P2 exhibit lower Td(below 300 °C ) ( Table 1 ). Optical Properties. The UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence ( PL ) spectra of P1-P6 were measured in CHCl 3 ( ca. 10^-6 M ) solution and in thin films , and the results are red - shifted 88 and 112 nm respectively , relative to monomer 4b ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ) due to increased conjugation. Compared to homopolymer P6 , all copolymers P1-P5 exhibit red - shifted absorptions and smaller optical bandgaps in solution and in film. Broad absorption bands located in the visible region were observed for the solution and film of P1 ( Figure 4 ). The absorbance maximum for P1 in solution is 496 nm. The absorption spectrum of P1 in film exhibits red - shift and distinct shoulder peak at ca. 540 nm , which are probably related to the formation of molecular aggregates owing to the strong interchain interactions. The absorption maxima of P2 in solution and in film are red - shifted 14 and 32 nm relative to that of P1 , respectively , thanks to its more planar conformation and increased conjugation. P3 and P4 exhibit almost same absorption profile in solution and in film. Compared to P1 and P2 , P3 and P4 exhibit relatively narrow and blue - shifted absorption band in solution and in film. P5 in solution and in film exhibits absorbance maxima at 503 and 524 nm , which are shifted 20 nm to the red relative to those of P4 , suggesting a more planar conformation. The trend in emission spectra of P1-P6 in solution and in film resembles that in their absorption spectra.",

    "sentence": "The copolymers P1-P5 emit weak fluorescence both in solution and in film with very large Stokes shifts ( 120-200 nm ) ( Figure 5 ) , suggesting that the polymers undergo considerable molecular rearrangement upon photoexcitation , leading to a big structural difference between the excited and ground states. 43,44 Electrochemical Properties. The redox behavior for P1-P6 and small molecule 4b were investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( Figure 6 ). The monomer 4b shows a reversible reduction wave and an irreversible oxidation wave. The HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials , assuming the absolute energy level of ferrocene / ferrocenium to be 4.8 eV below vacuum , and the data are summarized in Table 2. The LUMO of 4b is -3.12 eV , which is similar to that ( ca. -3.23 eV ) of n - type building block BTI ( 6 , Figure 1 ). 27 As it is generally assumed that a high electron affinity ( > 3 eV ) is necessary for n - type materials , 4,45,46 we suggest that dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide functions as a n - type building block. However , compared to the very strong n - type building blocks PDI ( 1 , Figure 1 ) and NDI ( 2 , Figure 1 ) the imide moiety indeed significantly lowers the HOMO / LUMO. However , the LUMO of P6 is higher than that of BTI homopolymer ( -3.47 eV ). 27 Copolymers P1-P5 exhibit an irreversible reduction peak and an irreversible oxidation peak. The HOMO / LUMO of P1 is -5.55 / -2.78 eV ; the electron - rich unit benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene leads to upshifting of HOMO / LUMO levels compared to homopolymer P6. The LUMO of P1 is higher than that of poly[thiopheneimide-alt-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b 0 ]dithiophene ] ( -3.6 eV ) , 20 indicating that the electron - withdrawing ability of dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide is weaker than that of thiophene imide ( 4 , Figure 1 ) . As a result of two more electrondonating thiophenes in the polymer backbone , the HOMO of P2 increases by 0.22 eV relative to that of P1. P3 and P4 with weak electron - deficient unit 2,2 0 -bithiazole exhibit similar HOMO / LUMO levels to homopolymer P6 , while the stronger electronaccepting unit benzo [c][1,2,5]thiadiazole reduced the LUMO by 0.28 eV. The HOMO-LUMO gaps E g cv , estimated from electrochemistry , are larger than the optical bandgaps E g opt , very similar to that for BTI homopolymer and copolymer. 27 Photovoltaic Cells. To demonstrate potential application of dithieno[3,2-f : 2^0 ,3 0 -h]phthalimide - based polymers in organic photovoltaics ( OPV ) , we chose P1 as an example to fabricate polymer solar cell devices because it possesses relatively broad absorption , proper HOMO / LUMO energy levels , and good solubility.",

    "sentence": "A new series of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) conjugated random terpolymers ( PBDTT-DPP-TPD ) were synthesized from electron - rich thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDTT ) , in conjugation with two electron - deficient units , pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) and thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) , of different electron - withdrawing strengths. The optical properties of these random terpolymers can be easily controlled by tuning the ratio between DPP and TPD ; an increase in TPD induced increased absorption between 400 and 650 nm and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level , while higher DPP contents resulted in stronger absorption between 600 and 900 nm. The best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 6.33% was obtained from PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 with [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) due to the improved light absorption and thus a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) higher than 16 mA / cm^2. Interestingly , the trend observed in the PCE values differed from that of optical behavior of the PBDTT-DPP-TPD in terms of the DPP to TPD ratio , showing nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6% . Density functional theory calculations showed that the small portions of strong electron - withdrawing DPP in PBDTT-DPP25-TPD75 and PBDTT-DPP10-TPD90 could provide trap sites , which suppress efficient charge transfer. In contrast , for PBDTT-DPP90-TPD10 and PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 , the effect of minor portions of TPD on electron density distribution was found to be minimal. In addition , the polymer packing and nanomorphology were investigated by grazing - incidence X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. The findings suggested that controlling the ratio of electron - deficient units in the random terpolymers is critical for optimizing their performance in polymer solar cells because it affects the polymer packing structure , the optical and electrical properties , and the electron distribution in the polymers . Low-band-gap polymers for bulk - heterojunction (BHJ)-type polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have been studied intensively with the aim of matching a greater part of the solar spectrum and thus harvesting more photon flux , to produce efficiencies greater than 7-9 % . 1-9 In most cases , low-band-gap polymers achieved by the donor - acceptor ( D-A ) approach do not show broad absorption , but instead the absorption maxima are redshifted , decreasing the number of absorbed photons in the visible region and ultimately limiting the achievable photocurrent. 10-13 One promising approach toward broadening the absorption of the solar spectrum is to develop random terpolymers based on the copolymerization of two different electron - rich units and one electron - deficient unit 14-16 or one electron - rich unit and two different electron - deficient units. 17-22 The judicious selection of two different electrondeficient or - rich groups with different electron - withdrawing or - donating strengths is critical to achieve complementary and broad visible light absorption , thus maximizing photon harvesting. However , successful examples of random terpolymers with broad light absorption and high efficiency are limited.",

    "sentence": "23,24 In addition , the comparison of random terpolymers with different compositions to their parent polymers has been rarely explored ; 25 such studies are critical for understanding the compositional effect of random terpolymers on the device performance , in terms of charge generation , transport , and structural properties. The combination of the different electron - deficient units of pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DPP ) and thieno [ 3,4- c]pyrrole-4,6-dione ( TPD ) can be ideal for producing broad light absorption due to the large difference between their electron - withdrawing strengths. 19,22 In addition , both units have been successfully used in D-A copolymers to produce high - performance PSCs. 26-33 While electron - withdrawing TPD possesses a relatively simple , symmetric , and planar structure suitable for D-A copolymers in PSCs , DPP exhibits very strong electron - withdrawing effect due to the presence of electrondeficient lactam rings and strong π-π interactions. 19,34 Herein , we report a series of novel random poly[thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4dione-thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione]copolymers ( PBDTT- DPP - TPD ) based on one electron - rich unit , thienylsubstituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDTT ) , and two electron - deficient units , DPP and TPD , that have complementary and broad light absorption ranging from 400 to 900 nm. This is a much broader absorption than other reported random terpolymers , 23,24 endowing a great potential for improving the PSC performance and providing an ideal system for studying the compositional effect of the random terpolymers on the PSC performance. While the ratio of DPP to TPD influenced the optical behavior of the random terpolymers , the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of the polymers showed a nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6% . The best PCE value of 6.33% was obtained from the blend device of PBDTT-DPP75-TPD25 and [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) , with a short - circuit current density ( J SC ) higher than 16 mA / cm^2. To understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the PCE , the optical , electrical , and structural properties of these random terpolymers with different ratios of DPP to TPD were systematically investigated. stated , all of the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received . The weight - average molecular weight ( M w ) , number - average molecular weight ( M n ) , and polydispersity index ( PDI ) of P1- P7 were measured by SEC with o-dichlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 ° C. The characteristics of the polymers are summarized in Table 1. To determine the actual ratio between DPP and TPD in the random terpolymers , they were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The 1H NMR spectra of the polymers are shown in Figure S1. The peak of the butyloctyl chains adjacent to the lactam N atom of DPP appeared around 4.09 ppm and the signal of the octyl chains adjacent to TPD appeared around 3.77 ppm.",

    "sentence": "Integration of the two distinct peaks for all random terpolymers was consistent with the feed ratio of DPP to TPD. The compositions of different terpolymers were also measured by elemental analysis and both values show good agreement. Thermal Properties. The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , as shown in Figure S2. The TGA revealed that the decomposition temperatures ( T d ) of P1-P7 ( 5% weight loss ) are 405 , 407 , 413 , 417 , 433 , 433 , and 444 °C , respectively. Thus , the thermal stability of the polymers improved as the amount of TPD increased. All of the polymers exhibited excellent thermal stability , which is important for their applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices. 35,36 Optical Properties. The optical properties of all the polymers in dilute chloroform solutions and thin films are shown in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 2. All the random terpolymers exhibited multiple absorption bands ranging from 300 to 900 nm , a common feature of polymers based on donor and acceptor units. 37 In addition , all polymers showed broader absorption in thin films compared to in solution due to stronger interchain aggregation. 28 The optical band gaps of P1-P7 were estimated to be 1.38 , 1.38 , 1.40 , 1.42 , 1.49 , 1.55 , and 1.85 eV , respectively , based on the onset of the light absorption. The absorption onset of P7 was blue - shifted compared to P1 , which was due to the weaker electronwithdrawing character of TPD compared to DPP. Upon comparison of the absorption onset of P2-P6 , a similar trend was observed with a gradual blue - shift from P2 to P6 with higher TPD content. In addition , the increased amount of TPD caused the appearance of a new absorption band around 500- 600 nm , which can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) band from BDTT to TPD. On the other hand , the absorption band around 700-800 nm , the ICT band from BDTT to DPP , gradually decreased as the content of TPD increased. By regulating the composition of the electrondeficient units , broad absorptions of the random copolymers , P2-P6 were observed from 400 to 900 nm compared to the parent polymers , P1 and P7 , indicating that incorporating two different electron - deficient units into polymer backbone is an effective method to broaden the absorption band and control the optical band gap. Electrochemical Properties. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements ( Figure 3 ). All CV measurements were recorded in a solution of 0.1 M Bu 4 NPF 6 in nitrogen - saturated anhydrous acetonitrile at a scanning rate of 50 mV / s. The results of the electrochemical measurements are listed in Table 2.",

The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / active layer / LiF / Al , where the polymers ( P1- P7 ) were used as electron donors and PC71BM ( or PC61BM ) was used as an electron acceptor. To optimize the morphology and ordering structure , different volume percentages of 1,8diiodooctane were added. 43 Figure 4 shows the current density versus voltage ( J-V ) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW / cm^2. The V OC , J SC , FF , and PCE values of the PSC devices are summarized in Table 3. From P1 to P4 , PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor , but for P5 , P6 , and P7 , PC61BM was used as the electron acceptor. P5 , P6 , and P7 blended with PC61BM showed higher PCE values than when they were blended with PC71BM in spite of the better light absorption of PC71BM , which is most likely due to the lower miscibility of those polymers with PC71BM. 44 The V OC of these random terpolymers increased in the order P2 ( 0.74 V ) ∼ P3 ( 0.74 V ) < P4 ( 0.76 V ) < P5 ( 0.79 V ) < P6 ( 0.82 V ). The trend in the V OC of the PSCs can be explained by the HOMO energy level of the polymers because the V OC is typically linearly proportional to the difference in energy between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor. 45 However , the PCE of the random terpolymers showed a the nonlinear compositional dependence from 2 to 6% in the order P3 ( 5.61% ) > P4 ( 5.26% ) > P2 ( 4.91% ) > P5 ( 3.02% ) > P6 ( 2.09% ) ; this was consistent with the observed trend of the J SC . P3 exhibited the highest PCE value of 5.61% among all polymers , including P1 and P7 , which was attributed to the broad absorption and increased V OC due to the deeper HOMO energy level.",

    "sentence": "The PCE of P4 : PC71BM also showed a higher PCE value than P1 and P7 , with a J SC of 12.95 mA / cm^2. In contrast , the PCE suddenly decreased in the blended device of P5 and PC61BM ( 3.02% ) and further decreased in P6 ( 2.09% ) , mainly due to the significant decrease of the J SC . The low J SC values of P5 and P6 were unexpected , considering the lower band gaps of P5 ( 1.49 eV ) and P6 ( 1.55 eV ) compared to that of P7 ( 1.85 eV ). To better understand the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC values , the space - chargelimited current ( SCLC ) of hole - only devices of the P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 blended devices were measured and compared ( Figure S5 ). The hole - only devices were constructed under optimized device conditions with the structure ITO / PEDOT : PSS / blends / Au. The hole mobilities of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 were 1.14 × 10^-4 , 1.13 × 10^-4 , 1.09 × 10^-4 , 1.10 × 10^-4 , and 1.18 × 10^-5 cm^2 / ( V s ) , respectively , showing that the hole mobilities of all random terpolymers were similar to or 1 order of magnitude higher than their parent polymers. Therefore , the trend of the J SC can not be explained solely by the changes in the optical properties and the hole mobilities. To gain a better understanding of the nonlinear compositional dependence of the J SC and PCE values of the PBDTT- DPP - TPD random terpolymers , the molecular geometries and the electron density distribution were simulated using density functional theory ( DFT ) at the B3LYP / 6-31G(d,p) level with the Spartan 08 software package. Three repeating units were taken as a model for calculations , and methyl was used instead of the long side chains to reduce the computational time. Four model compounds , ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 , (BDTT-DPP)-(BDTT-TPD)-(BDTT-DPP) , (BDTT-TPD)-(BDTT-DPP)-(BDTT-TPD) , and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 were used and calculated for comparison. The optimized molecular geometries of the models and their calculated HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals are depicted in Figure 5 and Figure S7. In general , for alternative copolymers , the electron density in the HOMO wave functions is well delocalized. However , the LUMO wave function shows a different degree of localization in the electron density dependent on the types of the electron - withdrawing units. 46,47 This tendency was observed in ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 .",

    "sentence": "In the case for ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 , the electron density in the HOMO wave function is evenly delocalized , but the electron density in the LUMO wave function of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 is slightly more localized on the electron - withdrawing units ( DPP ) compared to ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 ( Figure S7 ). In contrast , for (BDTT-TPD)-(BDTT-DPP)-(BDTT-TPD) , the electron density distribution in the HOMO wave function is different from those of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 5c,d ). Therefore , the small portions of DPP could hinder the preseparation of an exciton into a loosely Coulombically bound exciton , which suppresses electron transfer from donor ( polymer ) to acceptor ( PCBM ). 48-50 Therefore , one possible explanation of the lower PCEs in P5 and P6 is that the DPP acts as a trapping site , resulting in poor intramolecular charge transfer. In contrast , as evidenced in the results of the DFT calculations for (BDTT-DPP)-(BDTT-TPD)-(BDTT-DPP) , the electron distribution in the HOMO and LUMO wave functions is similar to those of ( BDTT - DPP ) 3 and ( BDTT - TPD ) 3 ( Figures 5a,b ). Such a trapping effect is expected to be trivial in P2 and P3 random terpolymers with a higher DPP to TPD ratio. Therefore , the incorporation of different electron - deficient units could significantly influence the intramolecular charge transfer , suggesting that the optimum composition is required to tune the intra-and intermolecular charge transfer and their performance of PSCs. More detailed studies are currently underway. Finally , to further improve the PCE of P3 : PC71BM , methanol was spin - coated on the top of the active layer before electrode deposition. The effect of a polar solvent in such a case has been reported. 51-53 The P3 : PC71BM device exhibited a V OC of 0.76 V , a J SC of 16.32 mA / cm^2 , and a FF of 0.51 with a high PCE value of 6.33% . Structural Properties and Morphological Behavior. The compositional effect of the two electron - deficient groups on the polymer packing and nanostructured order in thin films was investigated by grazing incidence X-ray scattering ( GIXS ) measurement. A thin layer ( 40-50 nm ) of PEDOT : PSS was spin - coated onto silicon substrates , and the pristine polymer or the blended thin films were produced by spin - coating on top of the PEDOT : PSS layer. Figure S8 shows the GIXS patterns of the pristine P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 , while Figure 6 presents the GIXS patterns of the P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 blended films with either PC71BM or PC61BM under optimized device conditions. In the in-plane X-ray profiles , a distinct peak of reflections from the ( 100 ) crystal plane , corresponding to the lamellar spacing , exists in all pristine polymer films.",

    "sentence": "Because the lamellar spacing in P1 ( 19.2 Å ) was smaller than in P7 ( 24.1 Å ) , the length of the side chains in BDTT is not the main factor in determining the lamellar spacing in P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 ; the lamellar spacing is mainly determined by the length of the side chains in DPP and TPD. As more TPD was introduced into the polymer backbone , the domain spacing of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 gradually increased from 19.2 , 20.1 , 21.9 , 22.7 to 24.1 Å , respectively. This is likely due to the increased amount of structurally longer alkyl side chains of TPD. Figure S8 shows that the pristine polymers exhibited a distinctive arc scattering of the ( 010 ) peak along the out - of - plane direction at q = 1.62- 1.68 Å -1 , corresponding to π-π stacking. The π-π stacking is more prominent in the out - of - plane direction , which suggests that most of the polymer backbones are oriented parallel to the substrates. The π-π stacking distances of polymers were 3.85 , 3.86 , 3.84 , 3.85 , and 3.74 Å for P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 , respectively. The combination effects of the DPP to TPD ratio with changes in the alkyl chain could affect the π-π stacking distance of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 and backbone planarity , thus influencing their charge transport properties. The π-π stacking feature of P1 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P7 in the blended films was significantly changed by the addition of PCBM , as shown in Figure 6. No π-π stacking diffraction was observed in P1 , P3 , and P4 , and only a faint π-π stacking diffraction pattern in the out - of - plane direction appeared for P5. However , P7 had a prominent π-π stacking peak even after the addition of PCBM , indicating that the polymer backbone adopts a preferential \" face-on \" orientation relative to the substrate. In spite of the \" face-on \" orientation of P7 , its mobility was observed to be slightly lower compared to the other polymers , which is most likely due to the presence of fewer percolating pathways for hole transport. 54 Therefore , the GIXS patterns revealed that the incorporation of the different units of DPP and TPD affects the polymeric ordering ( i.e. , domain spacing ) as well as its direction. For further characterization , the BHJ morphology of the polymer blends was investigated by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ). The resulting AFM and TEM images are shown in Figure 7 and Figure S9 , respectively. The images of P1 , P3 , P4 , and P5 blends showed bicontinuous structures of polymer and PCBM as well as small - scale phase separation favorable for exciton dissociation.",

    "sentence": "For comparison , the image of P7 : PC61BM blend showed coarser domains with a rougher surface , as the films were prepared from chloroform unlike other the blends . A new series of PBDTT-DPP-TPD random terpolymers containing two different electron - deficient units ( DPP and TPD ) were synthesized to produce polymers with complementary and broad light absorption from 400 to 900 nm. Through the variation of DPP to TPD composition in the polymers , we successfully tuned the frontier energy levels and illustrated the benefits of this approach in relation to PSC device performance. The optimal ratio of 75 : 25 between DPP and TPD in the random terpolymers enhanced the efficiency of P3 : PC71BM , exhibiting 6.33% due to improved light absorption and thus a J SC value higher than 16 mA / cm^2. In contrast , P5 and P6 with higher TPD contents of 75 and 90% , respectively , exhibited PCE values of 2-3 % , which are significantly lower than those observed for P1 and P7. We found that the optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers could not solely explain this nonlinear compositional dependence. Therefore , we developed a quantitative understanding of the polymer packing structure and the electrical properties using GIXS and DFT , respectively. The DFT calculation results revealed that incorporation of two electron - deficient units changes the electron distribution in the polymer backbone , thus affecting the charge transfer in the PSCs. Consequently , these findings suggest that the design and synthesis of new random terpolymers is a promising way to broaden the absorption of their parent polymers and that optimization of the composition of random terpolymers is critically important to maximize the PSC performance. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Materials and methods , detailed experimental procedures , and additional data.

The acceptor units were varied from BT to BO for adjusting the energy levels and optimizing the structures of polymers. Both copolymers possess good solubility , high thermal stability , broad absorption , and low bandgap and exhibit not only high field - effect mobilities but also high photovoltaic properties. The hole mobilities reach 0.43 and 0.34 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO film , respectively. Bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated by using PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO as electron donor and PC71BM as acceptor show a power conversion efficiency of 3.22% and 5.07% , respectively , under illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW cm^-2 . Both the hole mobilities and PCEs are among the highest values in the current reports based on naphthodithiophene - based polymers , indicating that \" zigzag \" naphthodithiophene - based D-A copolymers are very promising for application as solution - processable organic semiconductors in optoelectronic devices . Solution - processable organic semiconductors are attractive for their potential applicability in low - cost electronics such as organic photovoltaics ( OPVs ) and organic field - effect transistors ( OFETs ) and compatibility with plastic substrates , thereby enabling mechanically flexible circuits. 1-3 Current state - of - the - art polymeric materials have allowed for the fabrication of OFETs with mobilities of over 1 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and OPV devices with power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) of over 9% . 4,5 Although remarkable progress has been made in the design and synthesis of p - type polymer semiconductors , their performances in terms of hole mobilities and photovoltaic properties remain to be further optimized and maximized. Moreover , a versatile building unit that can be utilized for polymers with both high transistor and photovoltaic performances is highly desired for effective material development. 6 An important strategy that has proved to be the most successful in achieving both high performing OPV and OFET devices is the donor - acceptor ( D-A ) approach. By judicious selection of the donor and the acceptor units , the D-A copolymer architecture enables engineering of the electronic structure including energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) , the energy band gap , and light harvesting properties as well as charge transport properties. 7 Among the currently available classes of materials , thiophenefused polycyclic heteroaromatics have aroused great interest due to their high charge transport properties.",

    "sentence": "In particular , the acenedithiophene family , in which two thiophenes are fused at the ends of acenes , such as benzodithiophenes ( BDTs ) , 8 naphthodithiophenes ( NDTs ) , 9 and anthradithiophenes ( ADTs ) , 10 offers multiple advantages over other classes owing to their ease of functionalization at the α-positions of thiophene substructures for easy and precise cross-coupling polymerization. Also , integration of thiophene with acene rings into a rigid and coplanar entity facilitates π-electron delocalization and induces strong π-π stacking for efficient charge transport. For example , Takimiya and co-workers reported four different NDTn isomers as shown in Figure 1 , which allowed to create a broad variety of NDTn - based polymer semiconductor materials , and high OFET performance with mobility of up to 0.77 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 based on PNDT3BT was achieved. 11 However , despite these numerous attractive properties of NDT - based polymer semiconductors , their limited solubility in organic solvents has hindered their widespread applications in organic electronics and optoelectronics. 12 To achieve the solubility and thin film uniformity required in solution processed OPVs and OFETs , NDT1 and NDT3 functionalized with two alkoxy groups were synthesized and applied in semiconductor materials recently ( Figure 1 ). 13 In addition , it was found that , compared with linear - fused NDT units , the copolymer incorporating the angular - fused NDT units can pack into higher ordered structures , thereby achieving higher OFET mobilities. It was also reported that angular - fused NDT has a lower - lying HOMO energy level than that of linearfused NDT , which could be beneficial for better air stability and greater open - circuit voltage ( V oc ) for polymer solar cells ( PSCs ). 9c Very recently , our group reported a broad bandgap D-A copolymer PzNDTTPD based on 4,9-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-naphtho [1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene and thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6dione ( TPD ). 14 The polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) with PzNDTTPD as donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor demonstrated a PCE of 5.26% with a high V oc of 0.91 V compared to the linear NDT - TPD - based copolymer PNDTTPD with a PCE of 4.0% and a V oc of 0.69 V. 15 Meanwhile , high - performance p-channel fieldeffect transistors with hole mobility of 0.067 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 and an on / off current ratio of 10^9 -10^10 were obtained. It is indicative that \" zigzag \" NDT (zNDT)-based D-A polymers probably possess unique and excellent optoelectronic properties when combined with a suitable acceptor moiety. On the other hand , we noted that benzodiathiazole (BT)-or benzoxadiazole (BO)based conjugated polymers are one of the most important organic semiconductors due to their easy preparation , excellent stability , and optoelectronic characteristics , and many efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of new BT / BO derivatives.",

On the basis of the above consideration , herein , we designed and synthesized two new D-A copolymers PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO ( Scheme 1 ) based on zNDT flanked with two thiophene units as donor unit and BT or BO as acceptor unit. We introduced two dodecyloxy substituents on BT / BO rings to guarantee good solubility of the polymers. The thermal , photophysical , and optoelectronic properties of the resulting two polymers were systematically investigated. The results showed that both the two polymers exhibit not only high fieldeffect mobilities but also high photovoltaic properties . Synthesis and Thermal Stability. The synthetic routes of monomers and corresponding polymers are outlined in Scheme 1. Monomer 1 was reacted with n-butyllithium and then with Me 3 SnCl to give compound M 1 in a good yield. Both polymers were synthesized by palladium - catalyzed Stille - coupling polymerization and purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction with methanol , hexanes , and CHCl 3 . The CHCl 3 fraction was then reduced in volume , precipitated into methanol , and collected by filtration , yielding shiny , bronze - colored solids. PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO can be readily dissolved in common solvents , such as chloroform , toluene , and chlorobenzene , and processed to form smooth and pinhole - free films upon spincoating. The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by GPC in THF solution relative to polystyrene standards , and the detailed GPC data are listed in Table 1.. Both polymers have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss at 313-320 ° C .

    "sentence": "Compared with PzNDTDTBT , a bathochromic shift ( ∼ 15 nm ) of the absorption peak of PzNDTDTBO is observed , indicating stronger ICT between the BO acceptor unit and NDT donor units. The stronger ICT within PzNDTDTBO is originated from a relatively stronger electron - withdrawing nature of BO unit compared to that of the BT one. In films , the absorption spectra of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are similar to those in solution , with obvious red - shifts ( 56-68 nm ) of their absorption maxima as shown in Figure 3b , which is a common phenomenon for conjugated polymers , owing to the aggregation of the conjugated polymer main chains in the solid films. In addition , both PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO display prominent vibronic shoulders at shorter wavelengths , implying an ordered arrangement in their solid films , with strong π-π stacking between the polymeric backbonesa feature that also appears in the spectra of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) , which is beneficial to improve the charge mobility of resulting films. 21 The absorption edges for solid films of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO are 703 and 704 nm , respectively , corresponding to nearly the same optical band gap ( E g opt ) of 1.76 eV. Compared with the reported copolymer PzNDTTPD , 14 both PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO show broader absorption spectra and smaller bandgaps , which can be attributed to the stronger electron - accepting ability of the BT / BO unit in the copolymer , and this is beneficial to increase the light - harvesting capacity for higher short - circuit current density ( J sc ). 2d Electrochemical Properties. Cyclic voltammetry has been employed and considered as an effective tool in investigating electrochemical properties of conjugated organic molecules and polymers. 22 From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammogram , energy levels of HOMO and LUMO can be readily estimated , which correspond to ionization potential ( IP ) and electron affinity ( EA ) , respectively. Cyclic voltammogram of the polymer films are shown in Figure 4.

    "sentence": "It can be noticed that the HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO is 0.15 eV lower than that of PzNDTDTBT , which benefits from the replacement of BT unit by the stronger electron - accepting BO unit due to the stronger electronegativity of oxygen atom than that of sulfur atom. Since the open - circuit voltage V oc of bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) PSCs is positively correlated to the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer , a higher V oc for PzNDTDTBObased polymer solar cells could be anticipated due to the lowerlying HOMO energy level of PzNDTDTBO. 24 Photovoltaic Properties. To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the NDT - based semiconductor , PSC devices with a configuration of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al were fabricated. Figure 5 shows the current density - voltage characteristic of PSCs based on the blends of polymer : PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5G , 100 mW cm^-2 . To further study the performance of the PSC devices , the hole mobilities in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) method using devices with structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Au at the optimized blend ratio of polymer / PC71BM. For unipolar transport in a trap - free semiconductor with an ohmic injecting contact , the SCLC can be approximated by the Mott - Gurney equation : ε ε μ γ ≅ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ J V L V L 9^8 exp 0.891 r 0^0 2^3 ( 3 ) Here J is the current density , ε r is the dielectric constant of the polymer , ε 0 is the free - space permittivity ( 8.85 × 10^-12 F / m ) , μ 0 is the charge mobility at zero field , γ is a constant , L is the thickness of the blended film layer , V = V appl - V bi , V appl is the applied potential , and V bi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode ( in this device structure , V bi = 0.2 V ). Figure 6 displays the ln(JL 3 / V 2 ) vs ( V / L ) 0.5 curve for the measurement of the hole mobility of the blend films of PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ( 1 : 2 , w / w ) and PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM ( 1.5 : 1 , w / w ) by the SCLC method. According to eq 3 , the hole mobilities obtained are as high as 3.3 × 10^-3 and 4.4 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO , respectively. Obviously , from the viewpoint of hole mobility , PzNDTDTBO is more suitable ( higher than 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) for the application as photovoltaic donor materials in PSCs.",

    "sentence": "The V oc , J sc , fill factor ( FF ) , PCE , and hole mobility of the PSCs are summarized in Table 3. The blends of PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO with PC71BM at different weight ratios were used to optimize the device performances , and their J-V curves are shown in Figure 5. The PSCs based on PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than that based on PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM. With a weight ratio of PzNDTDTBO to PC71BM 1.5 : 1 , a PCE of 4.37% with V oc of 0.76 V , J sc of 10.35 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 55.5% was achieved while the devices based on PzNDTDTBT showed a relatively low PCE of 2.43% , with V oc of 0.62 V , J sc of 8.21 mA cm^-2 , and FF of 47.7% at the optimal PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM ratio of 1 : 2 ( w / w ). The increased value of V oc of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs is in accordance with the decreased value of the HOMO energy level of the polymer and the higher J sc and FF could be attributed to the higher hole mobility ( 4.4 × 10^-2 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). By addition of 1% 1,8-diiodooctane ( DIO ) into o-DCB used for spin - coating , the PCEs of the solar cells based on PzNDTDTBT or PzNDTDTBO were improved to 3.22 and 4.63% , respectively , mostly through an increase in the FF. 25 To further improve the photovoltaic performances of the PSC devices , thermal annealing was employed. , the FF of PzNDTDTBO - based PSCs increased from 62.5 to 65.5% , and consequently , the PCE increased from 4.63 to 5.07% . However , for PzNDTDTBT , the measured PCE was not improved by thermal annealing but , inversely , exhibited a slight decrease of photovoltaic values. Compared with PzNDTDTBT / PzNDTDTBO , PSCs based on PzNDTTPD shows higher V oc , which corresponds to the deepest HOMO energy level of PzNDTTPD ( see Table 2 ). . . Figure 7 shows the AFM images of the active layer surfaces. Without additive or thermal annealing , both the blend films based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO demonstrate smooth morphology with low average surface roughness ( R a ) of 0.27 and 1.23 nm , respectively. After adding DIO , a nanoscaled fine interpenetrating network and smaller domain size of phase separation are formed , which is beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport. R a is raised from 0.27 to 1.91 nm for PzNDTDTBT and from 1.23 to 1.88 nm for PzNDTDTBO , which can explain the increase of FF of the photovoltaic devices to some degree. When the PzNDTDTBO blend film was then thermally annealed at 150 °C for 10 min , R a is further increased.",

    "sentence": "However , it seems that some larger phase aggregation occurs in PzNDTDTBT / PC71BM blend , which has a negative effect on the PSCs and corresponds to the slight photovoltaic performance degradation of PzNDTDTBT. 21a,26. Herein , the EQE curves of the devices with the optimal performance are shown in Figure 8. The devices showed a relatively high photoconversion efficiency over the whole wavelength range of 300-700 nm , with monochromatic EQE values around 50-60 % . Compared to the absorption spectra of pristine polymers , the significantly broadened EQE responses in the visible region can be attributed to both the intrinsic absorptions of the polymers and PC71BM. Also , it can be noted that devices based on PzNDTDTBO show stronger Field - Effect Transistor Properties. The performances of polymer field - effect transistors based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO were investigated using a bottom-gate , bottomcontact configuration. . ( Figure 9 ). All devices with L = 5 μm showed the highest hole mobility at different annealing temperatures. The devices showed a typical p - type transporting characteristic measured under ambient conditions. As shown in Table 4 , for both polymers the annealing temperature tends to affect the hole mobility. All devices based on both polymers were annealed at 60 , 100 , 140 , 180 , 220 , and 260 °C , and both polymers showed thermal stability on each device. Figure 10 shows the output curves and transfer characteristics of the OFETs based on the polymers at 25 °C and optimal annealing temperature. ( Other OFETs data at different annealing temperatures are shown in Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2. ) After thermal annealing , the hole mobilities of both copolymers are increased , which implies that the crystallinity of the polymer films and ordered lamellar structure of π-π closepacking for polymer main chain are significantly improved at higher temperatures. High current modulation is observed with on / off current ratio of 10^6 -10^7 for PzNDTBTBO while PzNDTDTBT shows relatively lower on / off ratio of 10^3 -10^4. The resulting optimal P-channel transistors demonstrate high hole mobilities of 0.43 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTDTBT and 0.34 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 for PzNDTBTBO. Both the hole mobilities are among the highest values for BT-or BO - based polymers. In order to deeply study the variation of the performances of OFETs of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO after annealing , the thin - film microstructures and topographies were investigated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and AFM. Figure 11 shows XRD patterns of the polymer thin films deposited on OTSmodified Si / SiO 2 substrates. For both polymers , obvious diffraction peaks were detected before the samples were annealed , which indicates that some degree of crystallinity has been formed at room temperature. PzNDTDTBT showed a sharp diffraction peak at 2θ = 21.4 ° and two weak peaks at 23.8 ° and 26.6 ° for the as-prepared thin film.",

    "sentence": "As the annealing temperature increased from 25 to 140 °C , weak diffraction peaks at 25.4 ° , 27.8 ° , and 29.3 ° emerged , and the diffraction peaks at 21.4 ° and 23.8 ° were slightly increased. Similarly , for PzNDTDTBO , after annealing at 220 °C , weak diffraction peaks at 4.3 ° and 8.5 ° appeared , and the peak at 32.9 ° , corresponding to a π-π stacking distance of 2.7 Å , became stronger and sharper. These XRD studies clearly manifest the enhancement of molecular ordering within thin films of PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO after annealing , which are in agreement with the observation that hole mobilities of devices increase with annealing. In addition , the high crystallinity of the PzNDTDTBO film can also explain the high hole mobility of the PzNDTDTBO / PC71BM blend film measured by SCLC method mentioned above. AFM images were performed on polymer thin films on OTSmodified SiO 2 / Si substrates as shown in Figure 12. The highly uniform intertwined polymer fibers are observed for both of the two polymers. With film annealing treatments , the films form larger crystal grains and better film interconnectivity , which are favorable for the charge transport and lead to an increase of the mobility . In conclusion , two new D-A copolymers with zNDT as donor unit and BT or BO as acceptor unit , namely PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO , have been synthesized by the Pd - catalyzed Stille - coupling reaction and well characterized. Both the copolymers possess good solubility and thermal stability as well as low bandgap for efficient photon harvesting. Compared with its BT - based analogue PzNDTDTBT , the introduction of the stronger electron - accepting BO unit into PzNDTDTBO not only enhanced the intramolecular charge transfer in the conjugated polymer but also downshifted the HOMO energy level of the organic semiconductor , and as a result , BHJ solar cells incorporating blends of the PzNDTDTBO with PC71BM showed the PCE of 5.07% after device optimization such as adding additive and thermal annealing , while a PCE of 3.22% was obtained in PzNDTDTBT - based devices. OFETs devices based on PzNDTDTBT and PzNDTDTBO exhibit high carrier mobilities of 0.43 and 0.34 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. Both the hole mobilities and PCEs are among the highest values in the current reported devices fabricated from naphthodithiophenebased copolymers. These results demonstrate that the 4,9bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho [1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene is a promising versatile core unit for developing high - performance OFETs and polymer solar cells.",

    "sentence": "Three donor - acceptor type of narrow band gap conjugated polymers with enlarged coplanar skeleton were synthesized via Stille copolymerization of indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) and naphtho [1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) ( NT ) based monomers. The energy levels , absorption spectra and band gaps of the resulting polymers were well tuned by utilizing different thiophene derivatives as spacer between IDT and NT units , and polymer PIDT-C12NT which employed bithiophene attached with dodecyl side chain as spacer exhibited superior properties compared to the other two copolymers. All polymers exhibited deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and subsequently lead to high open circuit voltages of fabricated solar cell devices. Best performance of the bulk - heterojunction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 5.05% was achieved with PIDT-C12NT as donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as acceptor , which can be attributed to its higher charge carrier mobility , the optimized interpenetrating network as well as enhanced absorption coefficient of photoactive layer with respect to the other two polymers. The results demonstrated that the combination of IDT and NT with appropriate spacers was a promising molecular design strategy for the application of solar cells . During the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted extensive attention due to their lightweight , low cost and great potential for the fabrication of large - area flexible devices. 1-3 PSCs based on bulk - heterojunction ( BHJ ) architecture are of particular interests since high performance devices with power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) exceed 8% can be achieved. 4-9 Typical BHJ devices comprise a phaseseparated donor / acceptor blend layer with low band gap conjugated polymers as the electron donor , and fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC61BM ) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as the electron acceptor. 10,11 Generally , when considering that open circuit voltage ( V oc ) is related to the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level of donor materials and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy level of acceptor , 12,13 deep HOMO levels for low band gap conjugated polymers are preferred in order to attain high V oc . However , lowering HOMO level would result in larger band gap , and thereby the absorption of resulted polymers would have less overlap with solar spectrum , which are unfavorable for high short circuit current ( J sc ). To obtain the ideal low band gap polymer with appropriate energy levels that can make a tradeoff between open circuit voltage ( V oc ) and band gap so as to maximize the PCE , an intriguing approach involves incorporat - ing electron rich moieties ( donor , D ) and electron deficient moieties ( acceptor , A ) and alternating them on the backbone , which are so - called D-A type low band gap conjugated polymers.",

    "sentence": "14-16 Recently , it was realized that the weak - donor and strong - acceptor strategy is especially effective , as the weak donor moieties can maintain low HOMO levels while strong acceptor moieties may result in narrow band gap via intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ). 17-19 Another issue needs specific attention consists of the molecular planarity , which may have significant impact on the molecular packing of polymers in solid state and thereby would affect film morphology and charge carrier transport properties. 20-24 We have previously demonstrated a novel naphtho-[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) ( NT ) moiety with enlarged planarity relative to conventionally used acceptor of 2,1,3benzothiadiazole ( BT ) , which can be used as a strong acceptor for D-A polymers. 18 It was found that the NT - based polymers exhibited distinctly improved photovoltaic performances relative to the BT counterparts , which can be attributed to the enhanced carrier mobility and reduced the band gaps. 18 The advantage of D-A type conjugated polymers bears NT as acceptor was also verified by using quaterthiophene or naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene as the donor unit. Such NTbased polymers exhibit 1 order of magnitude increased hole mobility in conjunction with obviously improved photovoltaic properties with respect to the corresponding BT version , which can be ascribed to the centrosymmetric structure of NT that can lead to straighter backbone and more favorable side - chain placement than the axisymmetric BT structure. 25,26 The fact indicates that NT is a versatile acceptor for high performance D-A type of conjugated polymers. Recently , indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) with two thiophene rings held in a rigid arrangement via a central phenyl ring has emerged as a promising donor moiety for D-A polymers due to its good solubility and highly planar structures ( Scheme 1 ). 27-31 Ting et al. synthesized random and alternating copolymers based on IDT and BT and the highest PCE reached 6.4% based on the corresponding PSCs. 28,32,33 Jen et al. studied several high performance D-A copolymers with IDT and different acceptor units. 29,34-37 The IDT - based polymers presented deep HOMO levels and hence lead to considerably high V oc of the resulted devices. Additionally , IDT - based polymers have presented pretty high mobility and the appropriate optical properties , which can facilitate the charge transport together with enhance the absorption of sunlight and subsequently lead to high J sc . 38 Therefore , both IDT and NT are promising building blocks for D-A type low band gap polymers and the combination of the outstanding properties of IDT and NT may develop a series of promising donor materials for high performance PSCs. In this manuscript , we report the synthesis and characterization of three D-A type IDT-NT based low band gap conjugated polymers , poly[2,7-(4,4,9,9-tetra(p-octylphenyl)-s- indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-3,7-(di(4-(2-ethylhex- yl)-2-thienyl)-naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole ) ] ( PIDT - EHNT ) , poly[2,7-(4,4,9,9-tetra(p-octylphenyl)-s- indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-3,7-(di(4-hexyl-2thienyl)-naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole) ] ( PIDT - DTNT ) and poly[2,7-(4,4,9,9-tetra(p-octylphenyl)-s-indaceno-[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-3,7-(di(3′-dodecyl-5-(2,2′-bithienyl))-naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole))] ( PIDT-C12NT ) ( Scheme 2 ) , by using IDT as a weak donor and NT as a strong acceptor.",

    "sentence": "Taking into account the fact that both IDT and NT are comparatively rigid coplanar structures along the polymer backbone , the IDT-NT based polymers may suffer solubility issue since the tetraoctylbenzene groups attached to the carbon bridges of IDT unit would not be enough to guarantee their solubility in common organic solvents. Therefore , the spacers consist of thiophene or bithiophene functionalized with various alkyl side chains were introduced in between IDT and NT units to improve the solubility of the resulting polymers , which may also potentially lead to improved molecular weight that is favorable for the optimal morphology and charge carrier transport. 39-41 We notice that the incorporated side chains may also increase the dihedral angle of their contiguous aromatic units , 42,43 which may somewhat inhibit polymer backbone planarity and thereby increase band gap and lower the charge carrier mobility. 40,41 However , it should be tried several different alkyl side chains to achieve a delicate balance of the molecular weight , solubility as well as planarity of polymers as no comprehensive rule has yet emerged of the influences of specific side chains. 44,45 It was realized that by switching the spacer between the IDT and NT units , the processability , backbone planarity , charge carrier mobility and film morphology can be optimized. Further investigation of photovoltaic performances indicates all devices present high V oc because of the relatively deep HOMO energy levels of these polymers , and the highest PCE of 5.05% was achieved based on PIDT-C12NT . Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ; see Figure 1 ) were used to probe thermal properties. No phase transition was observed for all three polymers by DSC analysis up to 300 ° C. All polymers have decomposition temperature ( defined as the 5% weight - loss temperature , T d ) over 450 °C under nitrogen as determined by TGA analysis , indicating their excellent thermal stabilities.

All three polymers exhibit dual characteristic absorption bands , where the short wavelength absorbance originated from the π-π* transition of the IDT unit , while the long wavelength absorbance could be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) between the IDT and the NT segments. 27 In chlorobenzene ( CB ) solution , PIDT - EHNT showed an absorption maximum at 599 nm and a slightly weaker peak at 433 nm ; when changing the branched 2ethylhexyl to linear hexyl side chain , the resulted polymer PIDT - DTNT showed a slightly bathochromic shift of two corresponding peaks to 608 and 439 nm , respectively , which may due to the reduced steric hindrance of the linear side chain.",

    "sentence": "In most reported cases , the band gaps of conjugated polymers are reduced by incorporating more thiophene units between the donor and the acceptor segments owing to the more extended and delocalized π-electron system. 49-51 However , it was interesting to notice that PIDT-C12NT , which has four thiophenes in each repeat unit , presented a simultaneous bathochromic shift of short wavelength absorption peak to 465 nm and hypsochromic shift of the long wavelength absorption peak to 593 nm along with increased relative intensity of the high and low - energy peaks. Analogous event has also been realized in D-A type of oligomers and polymers based on 3,4bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene or 2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene as donor and BT as acceptor , which demonstrated that with the depleting composition of BT unit along the conjugated backbone , the dual absorbing bands were induced to move toward the maximum absorption ( λ max ) of the all - donor homopolymer that located in between of the dual absorbance. 52 In solid state , all polymers showed red - shifted absorption spectra compare to their solution absorption ( Figure 2b ) , which could be ascribed to the aggregation of polymer main chain. We realized a slightly bathochromic shift of the PIDT - DTNT absorbance relative to that of the PIDT - EHNT , which was in consistent with the trend realized in solution , while PIDT-C12NT showed a pronounced bathochromic shift of the low energy band absorption with λ max moved from 593 nm in solution to 619 nm as thin film. It was also worth noting that PIDT-C12NT showed much higher absorption coefficient than other two polymers in the whole visible area. Considering that high photo flux of solar spectrum within the region of about 550-700 nm , more intensified absorption of PIDT-C12NT indicated that more sunlight can be harvested that would potentially lead to higher J sc than the other two polymers. The optical band gaps of the polymers are in the range of 1.64 - 1.69 eV as estimated from the absorption onset and the detailed results are summarized in Table 1. Cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) measurements were carried out to evaluate the molecular frontier orbitals of the resulted polymers. The graphite , platinum wire , and Ag / AgCl were used as the working electrode , counter electrode , and reference electrode , respectively. Polymer films were casted from chlorobenzene solution with concentration of 8 mg mL -1 and all measurements were carried out under inert atmosphere. Figure 3 showed the oxidation of cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films on graphite disk electrode in tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate ( Bu 4 NPF 6 ) solution ( 0.1 M in acetonitrile ) at a scan rate of 50 mV s^-1 .",

The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference of the HOMO energy levels and optical band gaps according to the equation : LUMO = ( HOMO + E opt g ) eV , which lies in the range of -3.79 ∼ -3.88 eV. The electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. All polymers showed very deep HOMO levels of ca. -5.5 eV , which were much lower than the reported benzodithiophene-NT ( PBDT - DTNT ) based poly- mers , 20 illustrating that IDT was a good donor unit that can offer deep HOMO level and high V oc of the PSCs based on the target polymers can be anticipated. Mobility. Hole mobility of donor polymers played an important role in the OPV performance of the resulting PSCs. 53 In order to evaluate the hole mobility of the resulting polymers , corresponding hole - only devices with configuration o f I T O / p o l y ( 3 , 4 -e t h y l e n e d i o x y t h i o p h e n e ) : p o l y -(styrenesulfonate) ( PEDOT : PSS ) / polymer / MoO 3 / Al were fabricated and the hole mobilities were obtained by using the space charge limited current ( SCLC ) model. The calculated hole mobilities of PIDT - EHNT , PIDT - DTNT , and PIDT-C12NT were 9.84 × 10^-5 , 1.66 × 10^-4 , and 2.42 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively. When considering that PIDT-C12NT shows higher hole mobility and superior absorption to that of PIDT - EHNT and PIDT - DTNT , it is rational to envisage that PIDT-C12NT would achieve superior processability and backbone planarity among three polymers. Morphology. Insight into the nanoscale surface topography of the polymer : PC71BM blend films with weight ratio of 1 : 2 were carried out by tapping mode atomic force microscopy ( AFM ). As can be seen in Figure 5 , blend films based on PIDT - EHNT and PIDT - DTNT with PC71BM showed unexpected phase separation , with corresponding domain size over 200 and 100 nm , respectively which are much larger than typical exciton diffusion length of ca. 10 nm. 54,55 In contrast , PIDT-C12NT based blend film displayed an interpenetrating bicontinuous network between polymer and PC71BM with optimal domain size of 10-20 nm that is pretty favorable for efficient diffusion of excitons to donor - acceptor interface.",

    "sentence": "We recognize that both J sc and FF of PIDT-C12NT based device were much higher than those of obtained based on the other two polymers , which could be ascribed to optimal morphology with appropriate domain size of the photoactive layer and superior charge carrier mobility that can promote the exciton separation and charge transporting , and consequently lead to simultaneously increased J sc and FF. The increased J sc of PIDT-C12NT may be also attributed to the enhanced film absorption coefficient so that more sunlight can be absorbed and then generate more excitons , finally produce more charges. It is also worth pointing out that the accuracy of the J sc results was further confirmed by external quantum efficiency ( EQEs ) measurement under illumination of monochromatic light. The EQE spectra are shown in Figure 6b. The calculated current density from the EQE measurement were 4.18 , 7.83 , and 9.72 mA cm^-2 for PIDT - EHNT , PIDT - DTNT , and PIDT-C12NT respectively , which show mismatches with that of determined from current density measurement of three devices in the range of 3-5 % . One can clearly observe the distinctly improved EQE values of polymers by switching the thiophene spacer from the branched 2-ethylhexyl side chain ( PIDT - EHNT ) to linear hexyl side chain ( PIDT - DTNT ) , which was further improved for the bithiophene spacer with linear dodecyl side chain attached on the optimized position ( PIDT-C12NT ) . In conclusion , three donor - acceptor type low band gap conjugated polymers based on indacenodithiophene ( IDT ) and naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) ( NT ) with differ - ent thiophene spacers were synthesized by Stille copolymerization. All polymers showed relatively deep HOMO levels that consequently lead to high open circuit voltage of the solar cell devices. It was shown that the improvement of the processability , backbone planarity , charge carrier mobility and optimal morphology of bulk heterojunction film blended with PC71BM can be achieved by switching the spacer between the IDT and NT units .",

The weak electron - donating characteristic of TA , which has 2-D extended conjugation by thiophene side groups , makes the copolymer exhibit a low - lying HOMO level of -5.5 eV with a low band - gap of 1.65 eV , which affords both high photo - voltage and photocurrent of the polymer solar cells. As a result , the solar cell device fabricated from the blend of the copolymer and PC71BM exhibits a promising power conversion efficiency of 7.02% ( V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 13.1 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.67 ). Moreover , the polymer solar cell as fabricated from the blend of the copolymer and di-perylene bisimide ( di-PBI ) as a non-fullerene electron acceptor exhibits a promising power conversion efficiency of 4.23% with V OC = 0.77 V , J SC = 9.8 mA cm^-2 , and FF = 0.56. This photovoltaic performance of the copolymer not only demonstrates that the TA is a promising electron - donating building block for a high performance low band - gap copolymer , but also the copolymer is compatible with both PC71BM and a non-fullerene acceptor for high efficiency polymer solar cells . Polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have important advantages over inorganic - based solar cells such as low material - cost , ease of fabrication with low processing - cost and the potential for fabrication of large area and flexible solar cells. 1 In the last decade , remarkable progress in the performance of PSCs has been achieved by introducing a bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) structure in the active layer. [2][3][4][5] It has also been demonstrated that low band - gap conjugated polymers with broad absorption of the solar spectrum are promising active layer materials to achieve a high power conversion efficiency ( PCE ). 6,7 Hence , an effective approach to achieve a high PCE of PSC is to design and synthesize high performance conjugated polymers. [8][9][10][11] In recent efforts to develop high performance conjugated polymers , building blocks have been carefully designed for the conjugated polymers to have adequate energy levels , broad light absorption and strong self - assembly for use in BHJ PSC. [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] As one of the most promising building blocks for constructing low band - gap conjugated polymers , diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) has emerged as the desirable electron - withdrawing moiety. 19,20 Over the past five years , a variety of conjugated polymers containing DPP have been investigated as promising semiconductors for application in organic optoelectronics such as field effect transistors , memory devices and PSCs. Indeed , DPP - based conjugated polymers have achieved impressive PCEs up to 9% by the combination of DPP and various electron - donating building blocks.",

    "sentence": "[21][22][23][24][25] On the other hand , fused heteroarenes have been utilized as electron - donating units for the synthesis of DPP - based conjugated polymers. The incorporation of an extended fused aromatic unit in the polymer backbone is expected to induce strong intermolecular interactions ( π-π stacking ) , affording high crystallinity to the polymer and thus resulting in a reduced energy barrier for charge carrier transport. Therefore , the DPP - based copolymers combined with fused heteroarenes have shown low band - gaps with excellent charge transport characteristics and thus a high short circuit current density ( J SC ) of the solar cell device. [26][27][28][29] However , since low band - gap DPP - based copolymers usually exhibit a relatively high - lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) energy level , leading to a low open circuit voltage ( V OC ) of PSCs , a compromise between the band - gap and the HOMO energy level of DPP - based polymers is critically required. One way to solve the trade - off between V OC and J SC of the PSC based on low band - gap polymers is to introduce arene groups which have weak electron - donating power. When a benzene or naphthalene group which has a weak electrondonating nature was incorporated into DPP - based copolymers , a low - lying HOMO energy level was achieved without a large sacrifice of the band - gap , and as a result PCEs were improved with enhanced V OC s as compared to the counterpart polymer with a strong electron - donating unit. 30,31 Anthracene is also an interesting building block as an electron - donating unit for low band - gap conjugated polymers , because the electron - donating power of anthracene is relatively weaker than fused heteroarenes such as thieno [3,2-b]thiophene and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene , and therefore , anthracene - based copolymers are expected to have a low - lying HOMO energy level. Furthermore , anthracene - based copolymers usually exhibit high crystallinity and high charge carrier mobility due to the coplanar fused structure of the anthracene unit. Therefore , a combination of DPP and anthracene could be ideal , thus leading to high J SC and V OC . Nevertheless , a few studies have reported that anthracene - DPP conjugated polymers show low PCEs less than 3% . 32 Here , we synthesized low band - gap copolymers incorporating 9,10-bis (5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)anthracene ( TA ) and DPP as an electron - donating and electron - withdrawing unit , respectively. Very recently , we have successfully demonstrated that TA is a promising electron - donating moiety of medium band - gap conjugated copolymers for high performance polymer solar cells. 33 In conjunction with its weak electrondonating characteristics , TA possesses an extended conjugation in 2-D , which is expected to enhance the light absorption and self - assembly of the resulting copolymer.",

Both copolymers also exhibit distinct vibronic shoulder peaks at 710 nm which are derived from the coupling of the electronic and vibrational transition. Therefore , these vibronic shoulder peaks at lower energy provide the evidence of strong π-π interactions , indicating that polymer chains are aggregated in the solution state. As compared to the solution state , the absorption onsets in the solid state are extended to 770 nm while the vibronic shoulders become stronger , indicating that both polymer chains exhibit a strong tendency to selfassemble in the solid state , which may induce crystallization. 37 This strong self - assembly of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP arises mainly from highly coplanar nature of the polymer backbone.

    "sentence": "The HOMO / the lowest occupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are -5.45 eV / -3.60 eV and -5.38 eV / -3.45 eV , respectively , as estimated from the oxidation and reduction potentials of cyclic voltammograms ( Fig. 1b and Table 1 ). The energy levels of the copolymers are lower than those of other heteroarene - based DPP copolymers reported previously , [21][22][23][24][25][26] and their low - lying HOMO energy levels are expected to afford high V OC s of the polymer solar cells. The crystal properties of the copolymers were investigated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ). The two copolymers clearly showed a characteristic diffraction peak in the range of 3-5 ° with a weak diffraction peak in the range of 15-20 ° which are associated with ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) diffraction , respectively ( Fig. 2a ) , indicating that both copolymers form a crystalline lamellar structure in the thin film state. It should be noted here that these copolymers exhibit distinct X-ray diffraction without any thermal treatment. Both copolymers exhibit a sharp and intense ( 100 ) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.2 ° corresponding to the interchain distance ( d 100 ) of 21.0 Å , while the ( 010 ) diffraction peak was observed at 19.4 ° for PTATDPP and 19.1 ° for PTAFDPP , corresponding to the π-π stacking distance ( d 010 ) of 4.6 Å and 4.7 Å , respectively. For identifying the reason for high crystallinity of the copolymers , the density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation for the minimum energy conformations of the copolymers was performed to reveal the difference of the dihedral angle between the TA and DPP units in the copolymers. To simplify the calculation , one repeating unit of each polymer was used as the model compound , and long alkyl substituents were replaced by the ethyl group. As shown in Fig. 2b , TA and TDPP have a coplanar structure with a dihedral angle smaller than 1 ° while TA and FDPP have a slightly distorted structure with a dihedral angle of 3.8 ° . This difference of the dihedral angle between PTATDPP and PTAFDPP accounts for the difference of d 010 , and thus , PTATDPP is expected to form a more closely - packed lamellar structure than PTAFDPP. To investigate the charge transporting characteristics of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP , bottom-gate and top - contact fieldeffect transistors ( FETs ) were fabricated. Both copolymers clearly exhibit current modulation and saturation with unipolar p - type field - effect charge transporting behavior , as shown in Fig. 3. The calculated saturation hole mobilities ( μ h ) for PTATDPP and PTAFDPP are 2.7 × 10^-2 and 8.9 × 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , respectively , with high on / off ratios ( > 10^5 ) and low threshold voltages ( < 20 V ).",

    "sentence": "The decent hole mobilities of both copolymers can be attributed to high crystallinity of the copolymers due to the highly coplanar structure of anthracene and DPP. It is also understood that the 3-fold higher chargecarrier mobility of PTATDPP than that of PTAFDPP arises from its stronger π-π stacking with a shorter d 010 , as discussed above. When the photovoltaic properties of copolymers are measured using PC71BM as an electron acceptor , it is found that the optimum blend ratio of polymer : PC71BM is 1 : 2 to afford the best PCE of both copolymers with the conventional device architecture of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / polymer : PC71BM / Ca / Al ( Fig. S2 and Table S1 † ). The best PCE was also achieved when o-dichlorobenzene was used as a solvent and the optimum thickness for the active layer was ca. 90 nm. The current density - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the optimized solar cells are shown in Fig. 4 , and the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Tables 2 and S2. † PTATDPP showed a best PCE of 6.69% ( V OC = 0.80 V , J SC = 12.3 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.68 ) , while PTAFDPP showed a best PCE of 5.02% ( V OC = 0.76 V , J SC = 11.2 mA cm^-2 , FF = 0.59 ). Both copolymers showed higher V OC s than other DPP - based copolymers due to their low - lying HOMO energy levels. Both copolymers also exhibited high J SC s and FFs , indicating their decent ability for charge generation and transport. Therefore , the TA unit is a promising electron - donating unit for low band - gap copolymers with a low - lying HOMO energy level. When the PSC devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture ( ITO / ZnO / polymer : PC71BM / MoO 3 / Ag ) in order to further improve the photovoltaic performance , the PCEs of PTATDPP and PTAFDPP - based devices were improved to 7.02% and 5.22% , respectively ( Fig. 4b , Tables 2 and S2 † ) , mainly due to enhanced J SC s ( V OC s and FFs were not changed significantly ). It is noteworthy here that the PCE of over 7% of PTATDPP is the highest efficiency of anthracene - based low band - gap conjugated copolymers. In spite of the same band - gap of the two copolymers , PTATDPP shows slightly higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP ( Fig. S3 † ). This can be ascribed to the closely packed microstructures of PTATDPP and thereby its high charge - carrier mobility than PTAFDPP. When the crystal structures of blend films of the copolymers with PC71BM were examined by XRD , the PTATDPP / PC71BM blend had strong and intense ( 100 ) diffraction while the PTAFDPP / PC71BM blend showed weak and broad ( 100 ) diffraction ( Fig. 2b ).",

    "sentence": "This result leads us to conclude that PTATDPP retains a higher crystalline nature in the blend with PC71BM , affording a better hole transporting pathway and thus exhibiting a higher J SC and FF than PTAFDPP. When the morphologies of active layers were observed by transmission electron microscopy , the PTATDPP : PC71BM blend shows clearly a fibril nanostructure ( fibril width ∼ 30 nm ) with the formation of a bi-continuous network , whereas the PTAFDPP : PC71BM blend shows a phase - separated morphology without the formation of distinct nanostructures , as shown in Fig. 5. It is well recognized that the nanoscale phase separation with a fibril structure is favourable for an efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport which are the prerequisites for high J SC and FF of PSCs. Therefore , the high FF ( 0.68 ) of PTATDPP - based device arises mainly from the efficient charge - carrier mobility and the formation of a nanoscale fibril structure of PTATDPP. To further evaluate the potential of PTATDPP as an electron donor material for PSCs , we fabricated a non-fullerene PSC device by blending PTATDPP with a non-fullerene small molecular electron acceptor , 2,2′9,9′-tetra(undecan-6-yl)- [ 5,5′bianthra (2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′)diisoquinolin]-1,1′,3,3′,8,8′,10,10′- (2H,2′H,9H,9′H)-octaone ( di-PBI ). 38 As can be seen in Fig. 6a , PTATDPP and di-PBI have well - matched energy levels with a LUMO - LUMO offset of 0.4 eV , 39 which is enough for exciton dissociation , and also exhibit complementary absorption , i.e. , di-PDI and PTATDPP absorb 400-600 nm and 600-800 nm , respectively. As a consequence , the blend film ( 1 : 2 in weight ratio ) exhibits a broad light absorption from 400 to 800 nm. The compatibility of PTATDPP and di-PBI as an electron donor and an acceptor , respectively , was also examined by monitoring the photoluminescence ( PL ) quenching of each compound in the blend film. As shown in Fig. 6c , the blend film shows excellent PL quenching over 95% of each PL from PTATDPP and di-PBI , indicating that photogenerated excitons from both PTATDPP and di-PBI are readily dissociated into free carriers at the interface of two materials. The non-fullerene PSC fabricated from the blend of PTATDPP and di-PBI exhibits a PCE of 4.23% with V OC = 0.77 V , J SC = 9.8 mA cm^-2 and FF = 0.56 ( Fig. 7 ). Interestingly , the blend morphology of PTATDPP and di-PDI as observed from atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and TEM reveals that PTATDPP forms a well - developed interconnected BHJ morphology with a fibrillar nanostructure ( Fig. S4 and S5 † ). This fibril morphology affords the effective exciton dissociation as observed from the PL quenching experiment.",

We have designed and synthesized two anthracene - based low band - gap copolymers , PTATDPP and PTAFDPP. Since the TA unit has a highly conjugated 2-D structure with a weak electron - donating nature , the copolymer composed of TA and DPP units shows a relatively low band - gap , a low - lying HOMO energy level , high crystallinity , and efficient charge transporting characteristics. The PSCs fabricated from PTATDPP and PTAFDPP with PC71BM exhibit PCEs as high as 7.02% and 5.22% , respectively. Furthermore , PTATDPP shows a promising PCE of 4.23% when a non-fullerene acceptor ( di-PBI ) is used as an electron acceptor material for the PSC device.

This kind of side - chain donor - acceptor ( D-A ) polymer exhibited better solution processability , lower HOMO level ( -5.34 eV ) , and more balanced carrier mobility relative to its corresponding mainchain D-A conjugated polymers. Using PBDT-TDPP-S as electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester ( PC71BM ) as electron acceptor , the resulting polymer solar cells exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties with a power conversion efficiency of 4.89% , an open - circuit voltage of 0.84 V , a short - circuit current of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a fill factor of 56.0% . Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have attracted significant attention because of their potential for achieving large - area , flexible photovoltaic devices through lowcost solution processing techniques. 1 To date , solar power conversion efficiencies ( PCE ) of 10.6% and 9.2% have been demonstrated in the cells with tandem and single junction structures , respectively , representing an important advance in the development of PSCs. 2 Many recent research efforts have been concentrated on the development of donor - acceptor ( D-A ) narrow band gap ( NBG ) polymers with broad absorption spectra. 3 Despite the great success of these D-A polymers in achieving high performance PSCs , further development of novel electron donor polymers is still in urgent need as the donor polymers play a decisive role in determining the device performance. Nowadays , most of the present polymers are in main - chain D-A frame , which may suffer from lower hole mobility due to the influence of acceptor units in the main chain. Aiming at investigating the effects of the D-A framework on device performance , Huang and co-workers proposed a new molecular design strategy toward side - chain D-A conjugated polymers , in which D moieties were employed to construct the main chain and A units were conjugatedly pended onto the D units in the side chain. 4 Compared to the corresponding main - chain D-A polymers , the side - chain ones mainly possesses three advantages. First , the highest occupied molecular orbit ( HOMO ) energy levels of the side - chain polymers can preserve in a deeper position. Second , a two - dimensional - like structural feature renders this class of polymers with better solubility. Finally , there exists an internal charge transfer ( ICT ) behavior from the side - chain D-A structure , which can fine - tune the band gap ( E g ) of the resultant polymers as well as promote an isotropic charge transport along the polymeric main chain. As a result of these merits , PSCs based on these previously reported side - chain D-A polymers exhibited a maximal PCE of 4.74% .",

Given that benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ( BDT ) unit has a large planar molecular structure by fusing a benzene with two flanking thiophenyl units and diketopyrrolopyrrole ( DPP ) , i.e. , pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione unit has a well conjugated structure with strong π-π interaction and electron - withdrawing effect , some main - chain D-A copolymers based on DPP or / and BDT units as prime building block had been designed for optoelectronic applications in both thin - film transistors and solar cells in recent years. 6 It is worthy to note that PSCs based on these copolymers with a tandem structure showed an increasing PCE of 8.62% . 2a Here we report another novel sidechain D-A conjugated copolymer ( PBDT-TDPP-S ) for highperformance PSCs , in which the BDT and thiophene units are conjugatedly formed the main chain and the di(thiophen-2yl)pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione ( TDPP ) units are pended onto the thiophenyl units to build the side chain by a linkage of a 2-vinylthiophenyl unit.

To our best knowledge , the efficiency is among the highest reported to date for side - chain D-A conjugated copolymers and is twice higher than that of the main - chain D-A counterpart polymer PBDTDPP-OR in the single BHJ PSCs. synthesized by a common Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 as catalyst with a high yield of 78.7% , as shown in Scheme 1.

The resulting PBDT-TDPP-S showed good solubility in common organic solvents , such as chlorobenzene , o-dichlorobenzene , and dichloromethane ( DCM ) , but PBDT - DPP was nearly not soluble in them. Gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) analysis showed that PBDT-TDPP-S has a numberaverage molecular weight ( M n ) of 1.34 × 10^4 g mol^-1 with a polydispersity index of 1.27 ( Figure S1 ). Thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) indicated that PBDT-TDPP-S has high thermal stability with a degradation temperature ( T d ) of 364 °C at 5% weight loss. The corresponding molecular weights and thermal properties of PBDT-TDPP-S are summarized in Table 1 , and the recorded TGA curve is shown in Figure S2 ( see Supporting Information ) .

    "sentence": "Their corresponding UV absorption data are listed in Table 2. In DCM solution , PBDT-TDPP-S shows two obvious absorption peaks. The first one at ∼ 420 nm corresponds to the π-π* transition of the polymeric backbone in short wavelength region. The second one at ∼ 590 nm in long wavelength region is attributed to the ICT interaction between the donor unit in the main chain and the acceptor unit at the side chain. Compared with the absorption spectrum in DCM solution , the one in solid film displayed a red - shift absorption peak at 602 nm and an additional shoulder at 655 nm besides the highenergy peak. The extended absorption edge in long wavelength region can be attributed to the more aggregated configuration formed in solid state. Compared to the main - chain copolymer of PBDTDPP-OR reported by the Jo group , this side - chain copolymer of PBDT-TDPP-S exhibited a 100 nm blue - shifted maximum absorption peak. The observed blue - shifted absorption phenomenon should be related to the less planar conformation and weaker D-A interaction for the side - chain D-A copolymer than the main - chain D-A copolymer. As a result , the optical band gap ( E g opt ) of PBDT-TDPP-S was shifted to 1.73 eV as calculated from the onset of absorption spectra in the solid film. 2.3. Electrochemical Properties. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) curve of the PBDT-TDPP-S film coated on a platinum electrode is shown in Figure S3 ( see Supporting Information ) , and the electrochemical data are also summarized in Table 2. An onset oxidation potential of 0.94 V and an onset reduction potential of -0.88 V ( vs SCE ) are observed. Based on an empirical formula , the corresponding HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels ( E HOMO and E LUMO ) of PBDT-TDPP-S were calculated to be -5.34 and -3.52 eV , respectively. This resulting E HOMO level is lower than those of the reported mainchain D-A copolymers of PDPP - BDT ( -5.16 eV ) and PBDTPP-OR ( -5.29 eV ). 8 The relatively low E HOMO for PBDT-TDPP-S is beneficial to achieve high V OC in PSCs , given the strong correlation between the V OC and the difference between the E HOMO of donor and the E LUMO of acceptor in PSCs. 8 2.4. Photovoltaic Properties. The photovoltaic properties of the PBDT-TDPP-S were studied in PSCs using PC61BM or PC71BM as an acceptor. The device configuration was ITO / PEDOT : PSS ( 30 nm ) / polymer : acceptor ( 80 nm ) / LiF(0.7 nm ) / Al(100 nm ). The effective device area was 7 × 10^-2 cm^2 , as defined by a shadow mask.",

    "sentence": "In order to understand the influence of ratios between the donor polymer and acceptor , thicknesses of the photoactive layer , and the annealing temperatures on the photovoltaic properties , the current density - voltage ( J-V ) characteristics of the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM - based devices at different ratios , thicknesses , and annealing temperatures are shown in Figures S4 , S5 , and S6 , respectively. The resulting photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables S1 , S2 , and S3 , respectively. The optimized ratio of 1 : 1.3 , thickness of 80 nm , and annealing temperature of 120 °C were obtained. In these optimized conditions , two typical devices using PC71BM and PC61BM as acceptor exhibited the following typical J-V characteristics in Figure 2 under 1000 W m -2 air mass 1.5 global ( AM 1.5G ) illumination. Device parameters , such as J SC , V OC , FF , and PCE are deduced from the J-V characteristics and summarized in Table 3. It is clear that the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM - based devices exhibited better photovoltaic properties as compared to the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC61BM - based devices , which can be attributed to the stronger absorption of PC71BM than PC61BM in the visible region from 440 to 530 nm , as shown in Figure 1b. A maximal PCE of 4.89% with an V OC of 0.84 V , a J SC of 10.04 mA cm^-2 , and a FF of 56.0% was achieved for the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM - based devices. To our best knowledge , the recorded maximum PCE and FF levels here are higher than those for the previous side - chain D-A conjugated copolymersbased PSCs. Furthermore , these PSCs based on the side - chain D-A polymer of PBDT-TDPP-S presented significantly improved device performance over those PSCs using a mainchain D-A polymer of PDPP - BDT or PBDTPP-OR as donor. 7 Figure 3 shows the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) curve of the device with the PBDT-TDPP-S : PC71BM blend. The EQE values are about 45% with a broad response from 300 to 750 nm , which are consistent with the optical absorption profile in Figure 1b. According to the EQE curve and the solar irradiation spectrum , the integral current density value of the device is 9.70 mA cm^-2 . The difference between the measured J SC and the integral current density values is within 3% . It indicates that our photovoltaic measurement is accurate and reliable. The moderate EQE reported here implies some potential for further enhancement in J SC as well. To assess the charge transport properties for the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM blend used as photoactive layer , we measured the J-V characteristics of single charge carrier devices at room temperature and applied space-charge-limited-current ( SCLC ) model to extract the charge carrier mobility.",

Although PBDT-TDPP-S contains bulky and rigid side chains , its blend film with PC71BM exhibited a high hole mobility of 3.8 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 . Moreover , the observed hole mobility is higher than those of the recent reported mainchain D-A polymers , 9 verifying that side - chain D-A polymers can have strong intermolecular orbital overlap and good molecular packing like main - chain D-A polymers. Besides the high hole mobility , the blend also presented high electron mobility in range of 4.4 × 10^-4 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ( see Figure S7 ). The measured hole and electron mobility are listed in Table 4. Such high and balanced hole - electron mobility for the PBDT-TDPP-S is responsible for the high FF level in the devices. To our best knowledge , the FF is the highest reported to date for side - chain D-A conjugated copolymers The surface morphology of the active layers was studied using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) under tapping mode in order to further understand why the device exhibited better photovoltaic properties at the annealing temperature of 120 ° C. Figure S8 shows typical AFM topography of the PBDT-TDPP-S:PC71BM blend film in unannealed and annealed conditions ( see Supporting Information ). The surface roughness is observed to be 0.773 nm in unannealed condition and 0.602 nm in annealed condition. It indicates that the surface roughness of the blend film can be tuned much smoother by the prethermal annealing. The smooth morphology of the active layer is available for improving the device performance. 10 Therefore , the devices exhibited improved photovoltaic properties by prethermal annealing at an appropriate temperature . In summary , a novel conjugated polymer of PBDT-TDPP-S was successfully obtained , which contains a donor unit of benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene in main chain and an acceptor unit of diketopyrrolopyrrole in side chain. The resultant sidechain D-A polymer exhibited high carrier mobility and outstanding photovoltaic properties in polymer solar cells with a PCE as high as 4.89% . The PCE level is the highest reported to date in the side - chain D-A conjugated copolymersbased single BHJ PSCs , which is twice higher than that of the corresponding main - chain D-A polymer - based ones. Our work presented a new promising side - chain polymeric photovoltaic material for high - performance PSCs .

High short - circuit current ( 14.87 mA / cm^2 ) and power conversion efficiency ( 2.71% ) were achieved , which is a significant advance for efficient photovoltaic polymers that respond to the whole range of the solar spectrum . In the past decade , polymer solar cells ( PSCs ) have received a great deal of attention as a potential renewable energy source due to their potential advantages such as low fabrication cost , light weight , and fast production of large area devices by roll - to - roll solution processes. 1 Among photovoltaic polymers , regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) has been extensively studied. Bulk heterojunction ( BHJ ) photovoltaic device combining P3HT as the electron donor with [6,6]-phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester ( PCBM ) as the electron acceptor have achieved power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs ) as high as 4-5 % . 2 However , the upper limit seems to have been reached for this material combination , as P3HT utilizes only photons located in the highenergy fraction of the solar spectrum with wavelengths below 650 nm. In fact , ∼ 40% of the total solar energy lies in the range of 650-1100 nm , which is a strong driving force for developing lowbandgap polymers to utilize the solar energy in the near - infrared ( NIR ) range. 3 Recently , significant progress has been made in the photovoltaic application of novel low - bandgap polymers with optical absorption wavelengths in the range of 700-900 nm. 4 Nevertheless , design of efficient photovoltaic polymers with optical absorption and photocurrent response extending to wavelengths of micrometers remains challenging. The first example of this kind of micrometer - response polymer ( μmR - polymer ) was APFO - Green1 , reported by Ingan € as et al. in 2004.^5 Subsequently , considerable effort has been devoted to the design and synthesize of μmR - polymers via a synthetic strategy of combining electronrich units ( donors ) and electron - deficient units ( acceptors ) in a copolymer main chain. To date , no more than 10 μmR - polymers have been synthesized , which are primarily based on a very strong electron - deficient unit such as [1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4-g]quinoxaline , 6 thienopyrazine , 7 or thieno [3,4-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole.",

    "sentence": "8 The photocurrent response of all of these polymers extends to a wavelength of 1 μm ; however , the external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of these PSCs in the wavelength range between 650 and 1100 nm is typically less than 10% , which results in low overall PCEs under AM1.5 simulated solar light. Up to now , the highest PCE of μmR - polymer was just 1.1% , based on poly(di-2-thienylthienopyrazine) by using complicated doubled active layers photovoltaic devices. 7 The fundamental requirements for promising photovoltaic μmR - polymers include the following : ( a ) broad absorption extending to or surpassing 1 μm to absorb more sunlight ; ( b ) a high LUMO energy level to allow effective photoinduced charge transfer from the polymers to the acceptor in the BHJ device and at the same time , a low HOMO level to keep the open circuit voltage ( V OC ) as high as possible ; ( c ) high carrier mobility to ensure that effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes suppresses photocurrent loss ; and ( d ) good solubility and appropriate compatibility with fullerene derivatives to form high - quality films by solution processing. The lack of successful photovoltaic μmR - polymers might be due to the difficulty of fulfilling all these requirements simultaneously with one polymer. Very recently , 3,6-dithien-2-yl-2 , 5-dialkylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione ( DTDPP ) was shown to be a promising building block for the design of photovoltaic polymers. 9 In our previous work , we also found the polymer , PDTP - DTDPP , based on DTDPP and dithieno[3,2-b : 2^0 ,3 0 -d]pyrrole was one of potential μmRpolymers. The PCE based on this polymer arrived 1.1% , one of highest value for μmR-polymers. 10 Herein , we present a new donor - acceptor alternative conjugated polymer , changing the alkyl chain in the diketopyrrolopyrrole segment of PDTP - DTDPP from 2-ethylhexyl to n-butyl. This new polymer , referred to as PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) , is designed to fulfill the abovementioned requirements simultaneously as much as possible. As a result , bulk heterojunction - type polymer solar cells based on PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PC 70 BM have broad photocurrent response wavelength range from 300 nm to 1.1 μm. High shortcircuit current ( 14.87 mA / cm^2 ) and PCE ( 2.71% ) were achieved , which is a significant advance for efficient μmR-polymers. *Corresponding author.

The new polymer PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) was synthesized by coupling 3,6-di(2-bromothien-5-yl)-2 , 5dibutylpyrrolo[3,4-c] pyrrole-1,4-dione and 2,6-di(trimethyl- tin)-N-[1-(2 0 -ethylhexyl)-3-ethylheptanyl]dithieno[3,2-b : 2^0 ,3 0 -d]- pyrrole via a Stille reaction ( Scheme 1 ). The polymer has good solubility in CHCl 3 but is only partly soluble in chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. The number - average molecular weight ( M n ) of the polymer is 18.9 kg / mol with a polydispersity index ( PDI ) of 2.04.

    "sentence": "The polymer exhibits excellent stability with an onset decomposition temperature ( 1% weight loss ) at 280 °C in air. This level of thermal stability is adequate for applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices. Optical Properties. The absorption spectrum of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) in film is shown in Figure 2 together with that of P3HT and normalized AM 1.5G photon flux for comparison. The polymer has a broad absorption band in the range of 500-1100 nm with a tail extending to 1.3 μm. The full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) film is 324 nm , which is nearly a double that of P3HT film ( 158 nm ). The optical band gap of the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) film is 1.13 eV , as estimated from the absorption onset ( 1100 nm ). All these data indicate that PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) can utilize a larger fraction of solar light that P3HT as a possible material for applications in micrometer response photovoltaic devices. Electrochemical Properties. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry ( CV ) was performed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) energy levels of PDTP-DTDPP-(Bu ). The CV curves were recorded referenced to an Ag / Ag þ electrode , which was calibrated against the ferroceneferrocenium ( Fc / Fc þ ) redox couple ( 4.8 eV below the vacuum level ) ; the CV curves are shown in Figure 3. On the basis of the onset values of oxidation ( 0.10 V ) and reduction potential ( -1.17 V ) of the polymer , the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer were calculated as -4.90 and -3.63 eV , respectively. The electrochemical band gap thus determined is about 1.27 eV , which is slightly higher than the optical band gap. X-ray Diffraction ( XRD ) Measurements. The XRD patterns of the bulk samples of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH) were recorded to understand their structures in the solid state. As shown in Figure 4 , both samples show diffraction peaks at low angles , which could be attributed to a lamellar structure. The d-spacings of the diffraction from ( 100 ) are 14.8 and 14.9 Å for PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PDTP - DTDPP(EH) , respectively. The peaks around 24 ° for both polymers can be assigned to the face - to - face distance of the aromatic groups in the polymer chains arranged in the parallel direction. This π-π stacking distance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) was 3.64 Å , slightly lower than that of PDTP - DTDPP(EH) ( 3.74 Å ) , which suggests that the butyl group in DPP segment is better for the close π-π stacking of the polymer backbones compared to the bulkier 2-ethylhexyl group. Hole Mobility. It has been strongly suggested that high hole mobility is an important requirement for effective photovoltaic polymers.",

    "sentence": "11 The mobility of PDTP-DTDPP-(Bu) was measured by using a field - effect transistor ( FET ) with a bottom-gate , top - contact device configuration built on an n - doped silicon wafer. Figure 5 shows the typical output and transfer curves of a representative device with PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) as the channel semiconductor. The hole mobility was estimated to be 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 , which is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that of other effective D-A type low - bandgap photovoltaic polymers ( 2.6 x 10^-4 -3 x 10^-3 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ). 5 Although the FET mobility might not be directly correlated to the photovoltaic performance since the situation of the charge transport is quite different from each other , the higher carrier mobility still suggests effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes in the photovoltaic devices. Photovoltaic Properties. The bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO / PEDOT : PSS / PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PCBM ( or PC 70 BM ) / LiF / Al. PEDOT : PSS was spin - coated on a precleaned ITO - coated glass substrate. The film was dried at 150 °C under a N 2 atmosphere for 5 min. After cooling the substrate , a solution of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM ( or PC 70 BM ) mixture ( 1 : 2 w / w ) was spin - coated , where a blend of chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene ( 4 : 1 v / v ) was used as the solvent. The devices were completed by evaporating LiF / Al as the cathode. The effective area ( 2 mm x 3 mm ) of the PSCs was defined using a metal photomask during irradiation with simulated solar light ( Scheme 2 ). PC 70 BM was also used as an acceptor because it has similar electronic properties as PCBM , but a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region , which can compensate for the poor absorption of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) in this range. Figure 6 shows the I-V curves of the devices with the best photovoltaic performance under the illumination of AM 1.5 ( 100 mW / cm^2 ). The corresponding open - circuit voltage ( V OC ) , short - circuit current ( I SC ) , fill factor ( FF ) , and PCE of the devices are also summarized in Figure 3. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of the devices under the illumination of monochromatic light is shown in Figure 3. Compared with the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PCBM system , the PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) : PC 70 BM system has higher EQE values of 30-40 % in the range of 450-850 nm , which contributes to the improvement of I SC from 11.31 to 14.87 mA / cm^2. Since the spectral response extends to over 1.1 μm , the spectral mismatch between the simulated and actual AM1.5 spectra must be considered.",

    "sentence": "We compared the experimental I SC under the simulated AM1.5 irradiation and the I SC calculated by integrating the EQE and the actual AM1.5 solar spectra. The calculated I SC from the EQE was 15% less than the measured I SC . This discrepancy might be attributed to the spectral mismatch in the NIR region and / or device degradation during measurements in air. The highest PCE of PSCs based on the PDTP-DTDPP-(Bu) : PC 70 BM system reached 2.71% , which was lower than the 4-5 % of the P3HT : PCBM devices. This could be mainly attributed to the lower V OC ( ∼ 0.4 V ). In addition , the charge separation efficiency in the current combination might not be as high as that in P3HT : PCBM , although it was difficult to estimate the internal quantum efficiency ( IQE ) accurately due to the light interference effect in the films. This might be attributed to the smaller LUMO offset or less ideal mixing morphology between the polymer and PCBM. Nevertheless , this performance is more than double of the highest PCE ( 1.1% ) reported to date for μmR - polymers , even when the spectral mismatch in the NIR region above was considered. Such improvement of PCE comes from relatively highefficiency photon - to - electron conversion in the broad range of the absorption in the blend film of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM. Considering the high EQE obtained in the range from 650 to 950 nm , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) is a promising candidate for applications in tandem photovoltaic devices in combination with conventional visible light absorbing materials. Furthermore , comparing the photovoltaic performance of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) with PDTP - DTDPP(EH) suggests that the alkyl chain in the DPP segment has a large influence on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers. A similar phenomenon was also observed for other D-A type photovoltaic polymers. 12 Synthesis of new μmR - polymers with different alkyl chain in both the DTDPP segment and the dithieno[3,2-b : 2^0 ,3 0 -d]pyrrole segment and a detailed comparison of the properties of all these polymers are now in progress. The energy loss from the low output voltage of the photovoltaic devices ( 0.38 - 0.4 V ) can be attributed to the relatively large difference between the LUMO levels of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and PCBM ( i.e. , small energy difference between the HOMO of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) and LUMO of PCBM ). There is still a room to lower the LUMO level of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) from 3.63 to ∼ 4.0 eV , which is ∼ 0.3 eV higher than the LUMO level of PCBM. If we can control the mixing morphology suitable for the charge separation , this energy offset might be enough to maintain a sufficient driving force for charge transfer and the higher V OC could be expected at the same time.",

In conclusion , a highly effective photovoltaic polymer with NIR response , PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) , based on alternating 3,6-dithien-2-yl-2 , 5-dibutylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione units has been synthesized. PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) has high hole mobility ( 0.05 cm^2 V -1 s^-1 ) and broad photocurrent response wavelengths from 300 nm to 1.1 μm. The photovoltaic properties of PDTP - DTDPP(Bu) were preliminarily investigated , and high shortcircuit current ( 14.87 mA / cm^2 ) and PCE ( 2.71% ) were achieved. Considering the sufficiently high I SC values of this system , more promising photovoltaic performance is thought to be achievable by using other fullerene derivatives with high LUMO energy levels , such as bis-PCBM 13 or Lu3N @ C80 - PCBH. 14 Further device optimization and the synthesis of new μmRpolymers are currently in progress and will be reported in due course.
